simulatque adoleverit aetas hor ser lib   sat   to which is added the beau monde or the pleasures of st jamess a new ballad  to the tune of oh london is a fine town etc  the second edition    london printed for a dodd at the peacock without temple bar and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster price   d mdccxxx  blundrella or the impertinent a tale the tea was drank and taken away no soul had any thing to say the weather and the usual din a fresh were going to begin fashion and scandal drained before on carpet had been brought once more but for blundrella common pest of the polite the standing jest blundrella idol of the vain and first in the loquacious train in all things ignorant and weak yet on all subjects would she speak and of her own perfections vaunted still daunting all herself undaunted of a most contradicting spirit and envious of anothers merit this creature thus with saucy air addressed belinda blooming fair madam i am told you sing i long to have the honor of a song much better bred than to refuse belinda pleads the old excuse she is caught a cold and feigns a cough but that alas will not bring her off blundrella urges her request now seconded by all the rest at length unwilling to appear affected peevish or severe the lovely virgin tuned her voice more out of complaisance than choice while all were with her music pleased but she who had the charmer teased who rude unmannerd and abrupt did thus belinda interrupt madam said the affected thing did you never hear squallinda sing i have heard her sing that very song would charm the whole seraphic throng of all the singers her for me she sings so sweet so clear so free but madam cannot you sing another that song i hope has got a brother let us have that which the fustina sings when she hangs on senisino its name i have forgot no matter it is that which makes the boxes clatter or madam but i beg your pardon there is a song that in the garden cuzzoni sings unto her son that or another it is all one belinda blushed with shame and rage but yet unwilling to engage so bold a foe in such a fray she let the creature have her way and though at sight she sung her part and was a mistress in the art pleaded her want of voice and skill which made blundrella prouder still who grew insufferably vain and altered both her voice and strain she talked of singers and composers of their admirers and opposers of the cuzzoni and faustini of handel and of bononcini one was to rough the other to smooth artillo only hit her tooth and tamo tanto was a song would give her pleasure all day long full loftily she gave her vote this had no voice and that no throat that heideigger had received a letter and we should shortly have a better a messenger was sent to dover to wait the ladys coming over who should no sooner hither come but she would strike all others dumb she likewise grew exceeding witty upon the consorts in the city it is true she liked the castle best but yet she made em both a jest nor did she much admire the crown but as twas the other end of the town she next of masters gan to preach the english were not fit to teach italians were the only men and even of those not one in ten for she had heard a lady say scarce two in town could sing or play what with composers players singers performance gusto voices fingers she ran herself quite out of breath and talked the company to death when happily with engaging air eugenio darling of the fair who touches charmingly the flute entered and struck blundrella mute and kept her clacketernal under for near a minute there is a wonder eugenio must expect his share for scarce he had assumed a chair but she impatient silence broke and thus the eternal teazer spoke now for a tune my pretty man nay you shall play say what you can ladies he is the delightfulst creature you never knew no soul play sweeter nay prithee now dont make a rout here it is egad come  pull it out what mortal man could stand the trial he must consent there is no denial so for mere quiet sake he plays while she even stifles him with praise and worries the poor man to death nor suffers him to take his breath but calls for tune on tune so fast eugenio is quite tired at last and begs a truce upon parole he will play anon with all his soul now you must know belindas charms had given his heart no small alarms he was her servant most avowed and happiest of the sighing crowd sophronia being her near relation happily laid hold on this cessation and to eugenio drawing near she whispered softly in his ear told him blundrellas vile assurance and sweet belindas mild endurance eugenio instantly was fired rage and revenge his mind inspired he reassumd his spech and flute and thus blundrella did salute madam said he before i go your dear commands i would gladly know blundrella reared her crest aloft and begged him to play something soft what think you madam of al ombra that is poor dull stuff do ye like sgombra si caro if you please said she he played the tune of children three she was in raptures and entreated the self same tune might be repeated he changed his airs and to her shame she took ten others for the same in short eugenio played her off and made her all the circles scoff while stupid she ascribed to wit and sense the laughter raised by her impertinence the beau monde or the pleasures of st jamess a ballad to the tune of oh london is a finetown etc oh st jamess is a lovely place it is better than the city for there are balls and operas and every thing that is pretty there is little lady cuzzoni and bouncing dame faustina the duce a bit will either sing unless they are each a queen  a and when we have ekd out history and made them rival queens they will warble sweetly on the stage and scold behind the scenes oh st jamess etc when having filled their pockets full no longer can they stay but turn their backs upon the town and scamper all away the belles and beaux cry after them with all their might and main and heidegger is sent in haste to fetch em back again oh st jamess etc then hey for a subscription to the opera or the ball the silver ticket walks about until there comes a call this puts them into doleful dumps who were both blithe and gay there is nothing spoils diversion more than telling what is to pay oh st jamess etc there is pope has made the witlings mad who labor all they can to pull his reputation down and maul the little man but wit and he so close are linked in vain is all this pother they never can demolish one without destroying tother oh st jamess etc and there is miss polly peachum lugs our nobles by the ears till ponder well by far exceeds the music of the spheres when lo to show the wisdom great of londons famous town we set her up above her self and then we take her down oh st jamess etc and there is your beaux with powdered clothes bedaubd from head to shin their pocketholes adorned with gold but not a souse within and there is your pretty gentlemen all dressed in silk and satin that get a spice of every thing excepting sense and latin oh st jamess etc and there is your cits that have their tits in finsbury so sweet but costlier tits they keep god wot in bond and poultneystreet and there is your green nobility on citizens so witty whose fortune and gentility arose from londons city oh st jamess etc we go to bed when others rise and dine at candlelight there is nothing mends complexion more than turning day to night for what is title wealth or wit if folks are not genteel or how can they be said to live who know not what is quadrille oh st jamess
