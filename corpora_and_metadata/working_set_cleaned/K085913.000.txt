fifteen myself and i remember very well i was just such a sweet little tender delicate morsel as you are now  i warrant thou have made a prudent choice   pol my father thought so for he consented that we should be married upon my lovers return from sea   curt is he a sailor i said you had made a prudent choice my husband has been a sailor and heaven knows we should now have been comfortably settled in england with the little we had got by the sea if upon our voyage we had not been taken by those wicked algerines we were made slaves to the great bashaw abdallah and my husband worked in the gardens while i attended the ladies of the seraglio but we were so kindly used that at last we plucked up heart of grace and told the bashaw all our misfortunes what do you think he did he gave us our

scold me  poor soul    pol indeed you seem very happy   curt why as he often says people are never unhappy but it is in some measure their own faults  let me see  it is forty summers since we first came together and in all that time we have seen nothing but smiling days it is true when we first fettled the indians came down upon us and plundered us of all we had and from the fright and one thing or other i had like to have died of a fever and once when he was at sea he was very near being swallowed up by a shark we were afterward shipwrecked then sold for slaves after that we were confined in a close dungeon and every body said we should certainly be strangled but no matter for that we had no bad actions to tax ourselves with and we were determined not to be frightened at any thing  exit

it is actually said if she behaves well she will be suffered to have her own servants to wait upon her   pol but what of my father   good i could not stay with him long for i was ordered into the bashaws presence but i did not forget to tell him that i had great interest and bid him hope for better days   pol bless you for it   good yes but when i told him so he smiled and said he believed his
