a mechanical enquiry into the nature causes seat and cure of the diabetes with an explication of the most remarkable symptoms  igitur hi qui rationalem medicinam profitentur haec necessaria esse

      an enquiry into the nature and seat of the diabetes scarce any disorder has afforded greater matter of speculation especially of late years than the diabetes yet the true rationale of it is not so accurately understood as to render a farther enquiry into its nature and causes in order if possible to search out the reasons of the several symptoms of it useless or unnecessary amongst the ancients is was seldom heard of aretaeus speaks of it as something miraculous  miraculum quoddam and galen confesses that in the course of his practice he only saw two patients laboring under this complaint the uncommoness of it might be owing to a different manner of living but the disorder was probably the same for the description which they give of it in the most essential points agrees with that of the moderns it is true indeed that most of them speak of liquor passing through the kidney not in the least changed and make no mention of the sweetness of the urine but these are mistakes which the color of the urine for want of accuracy and observation might be the cause of their falling into for as dr willis observes it always appears crude and watery as of those laboring with the pica or with the dropsy their methods also of cure which were rationally founded and in most respects similar to the present practice are a farther confirmation of this opinion galen made use of the following medicines as he himself testifies to the great relief of his patient bol armen gum tragac  arab  mastich spodium sem endiv  portulac etc and they seem to be well adapted to the removal of this disease so far as they are known to strengthen weaknd solids to sheath acrimonious humors to incrassate too much attenuated blood to abate hectic fevers and to cool the body but this will be farther considered in its proper place it may not be improper before we enter upon the enquiry briefly to point out the opinions which the ancients and some of the moderns entertained of this disease  de curat diabet lib   c   aretaeus supposed it to be a species of a dropsy  and that it was owing to an universal debility of body for as in a dropsy the solid parts of the body are dissolved into water so in a diabetes they are melted down into  de morb diut lib   c   urine but supposing such a waste of the body and such a dissolution of the solids how comes it to pass that they are dissolved into urine may not the humors arising from such a supposed decay and wasting of the body tend to any other viscus as well as to the kidney and seeing it is well known that all fluids naturally tend to the weakest parts is it not by far more reasonable to suppose that they should be lodged either in the abdomen or membrana cellulosa being those parts of the body which give the least resistance and form dropsical swellings than be evacuated by urine such an universal consumption then of the body does not seem to be the primary cause of this disease but may be and is the consequence of it      de loc affect lib sect p     galen and his followers   alexander trallianus p   0 to the same purpose speak oribasius paulus aegineta and aetius   differed from this opinion and thought it owing to an imbecility in the kidneys and so far indeed they seem to have judged right but then their manner of accounting for such a copious discharge of urine was very whimsical for they supposed that the humors contained in the several parts of the body were brought to the kidneys by an attractive power in them and that the humors so attracted quickly forced their exit out of the body this account of it then shows rather a fertility of imagination than solidity of reasoning for the possibility of such an attraction is surely as difficult to be conceived as the cause of attraction itself et quandoque facit diabetem potus aquae frigidae aut obsessio vehemens frigoris in totum penetrantis aut propter vehementiam attractivae propter virtutem calidam  quare renes attrahunt ab hepate p     avicenna speaks of it much to the same purpose and no wonder seeing that the arabian physicians borrowed their systems of physic from the greek aurelianuss chapter upon this disease is lost and tom prim p     celsus only lays down some general methods of cure to be observed cum vrina super potionum modum mingitur  a diabetes says tom prim p     etmuller is either genuine or spurious the former is a voiding of liquors by urine without undergoing any alteration in the body the latter is a voiding of a much larger quantity of urine than of liquids received into the body the cause of the former he thinks is owing to a laxity and openness of the passages which lead directly from the first passages to the kidneys but these he confesses are not yet known and no wonder because it is evident from the nicest observations made in anatomy that there are no such passages leading directly to the kidneys as he imagines and therefore that no liquor can possibly arrive to the kidneys but by first entering into the blood to account for the latter he supposes a sharp acrimony in the blood which resolves attenuates and melts down the blood and even the muscular flesh itself into serum which being thus melted down stimulate the kidneys and force their passage but this account of it is so very strange and unphilosophical that it will not admit of a serious consideration  exercit de diabete p    lister is singular in his opinion and thinks that the chief seat of this disorder is in the stomach and small intestines at primaria hujus morbi seeds est stomachus and intestina tenuia but if these parts of the body were principally affected a lientery or a diarrhaea rather than a diabetes would surely be produced  dr willis that great physician of his time observes that rhenish wine cider and acid liquors being drank provoke a more plentiful diuresis or evacuation by urine the cause of this evacuation he attributes to a fusion or melting of the blood into serosities by such acid liquors so that the crasis or mixtion of the blood being dissolved the watery parts cannot be contained by the more thick but sliding from their embraces and being imbued with saline particles do run through the most open passages of the reins and so cause a diabetes and he gives us an instance of one who by using rhenish wine for his ordinary drink twenty days together contracted an incurable diabetes of which he died within a month but the diabetes in this case and when brought on by an immoderate drinking of such thin acid liquors does not seem to be owing to such a dissolution of the blood as the doctor intimates but to the natural disposition of such liquors to pass off by urine the secerning vessels of the kidney then must necessarily be overloaded by the great quantity of fluids which they admit and of course greatly relaxed and hence a diabetes will ensue as will be shown more particularly in its due place for let the blood be in ever so dissolute and broken a state this distemper will not be produced unless there is a relaxation of the kidney in conjunction with it but rather a dropsy and for reasons that have been already insisted upon an immoderate drinking then of acid liquors and thin wines by their quick and sudden passage through the kidneys will bring on a debility of these organical parts widen their secretory ducts and in this manner produce a diabetes and such an excess of them seems to be the most frequent cause of it  the account which animal secretion p  0 dr james keil gives of this disease comes next to be considered  he asserts that the most evident cause of this disease is an habitual drinking of strong liquors and that the more spirituous they are the sooner and more violently they bring it by such an habitual drinking of strong liquors it comes to pass in process of time that the serum or thin part of the blood contains a large proportion of a spirituous fluid or that part of the serum which should be water is for the greatest part spirit now the salts of the urine or blood will not dissolve in a vinous spirit that is the particules of which the salts consist are more strongly attracted by one another than they are by such a fluid as by experiment appears and therefore the quantity of salts in the blood will be daily increased and circulating through the capillary vessels must irritate the fine fibers and cause little pains and twitchings all over the body which he says are the preceding symptoms of this disorder but when the serum is full of these salts the distance between them and the globules of the blood will be less and consequently they will attract the globules of the blood more strongly than the globules attract one another and the globules or red part of the blood will be dissolved and diffused through the serum of the blood and this again is confirmed by experiments for nothing does render the red part of the blood so fluid and keeps it more from coagulating when drawn into a cup than urinous salts and spirits when the red part of the blood is thus dissolved and united to its serum it will with the serum be carried off through the glands of the kidneys and being united to their salts will alter their figures and properties as litharge and coral do the salts of vinegar giving them a sweet taste  in this account of the diabetes there seems to be more ingenuity than truth that spirituous liquors when drank to excess may be productive of this disorder will be shown in the sequel of this dissertation but that an habitual drinking of them is the most evident cause of it is evidently not true but granting such a dissolution of the red part of the blood as the dr imagines which may be possible but does by no means seem probable there is no reason assigned why it should with its serum be carried off through the glands of the kidney the objections which have been already made occur here  proceed we now to the opinion of the celebrated in the new edit of his book on poisons p    dr mead which demands our attention as well for its singularity as for the eminent character of its author the diabetes he says is not as physicians have commonly judged a distemper of the kidneys but of the liver proceeding likewise from a vitiated mixture of the bile it most frequently happens to those who without due exercise indulge themselves in drinking vinous liquors and then quench their thirst arising from these by too great a quantity of such as are cooling  by such illtimed heating and cooling of the humors of the body the natural proportion of salt in the bile by which its oily part is incorporated with the water is not sufficient now the water overabounds to preserve the mixture so that a great portion of this together with some of the thinnest of the oil will be discharged by the kidneys and the urinary ducts will be greatly enlarged by a constant aflux that way by which means the thicker oily particles are left in a degree of coagulation in the smaller tubes of the liver and are there formed into a hard fatty substance  the dissection of those who have died of the diabetes proves this to be so for i have always found a steatomatous collection in their liver in appearance not unlike to what is often discharged by stools in a confirmed jaundice but of a harder consistence  in the first place let it be here observed that the texture of the v boerhaave s acad lect v   p   0 kidney is so very close and compact that in its natural state before it has suffered any kind of violence it will not admit any oily substance whatever unless it be highly attenuated and thoroughly incorporated in a proper vehicle a preternatural dilatation of the kidney must be prior to its admittance of any fluid that is more gross than the urine it does not then seem probable that even this thinnest oil in such circumstances when the mixture is destroyed can be admitted to pass through the kidney beside such a disposition of the liver as is here supposed and such a vitiated mixture of the bile must necessarily be attended with a high jaundice but as the diabetes often appears without the least icterical symptom it seems necessarily to follow that the liver is not the seat of the diabetes  the ingenious dr randolph in his treatise upon the medicinal virtues of the bristol water after having made some just observations upon these accounts of it last mentioned gives us his opinion of it and is inclined to think the kidneys the seat of this disorder though he owns that the great alteration made in the urine seems very much to favor the opinion of a fault in the fluids for if the kidneys says he were only in fault why should diabetical urine differ so much from that which is natural not only in quantity but in quality also but the reason of this alteration will evidently appear by prosecuting the enquiry farther than seems to have been consistent with his design and in order to proceed more methodically  i shall first describe a diabetes by pointing out the several symptoms of it   dly show how a relaxation of the secretory ducts of the kidneys with a broken state of the blood which may be prior to such a relaxation must necessarily be the cause of such symptoms and when not will be the consequence of it  a person then is known to labor under a diabetes by the following symptoms to wit a copious and frequent discharge of palecolourd urine the taste of which is sweet the quantity evacuated exceeds in proportion the quantity of liquors taken in it is found to acquire a ropy consistence by being exposed for some time to the air as a consequence of this discharge a hectic fever loss of flesh great thirst a sense of weakness about the loins and if constitutional or too far advanced by a neglect of proper remedies the person so affected in reality dies of a consumption these are then the most remarkable symptoms of a diabetes and the known consequences of it  i am in the next place to show how a relaxation of the secretory ducts of the kidneys with a dissolute broken blood must necessarily be productive of these symptoms but here it will be proper first to point out the causes by which such a relaxation may be brought on  and here let it be remarked that whenever a gland is in a state of relaxation it will not duly perform its respective office  it is well known that whatever stretches out an animal fiber beyond its due degree of distension and keeps it for some time so distended will weaken the contractive spring of that fiber  now the glands may be relaxed or their contractive spring weaknd by several different means as first by being pressed upon with too great a quantity of fluids and this may happen either from a stoppage of perspiration or from a defect of secretion in one gland which may be occasioned by some obstruction formed in the secretory ducts of that gland and is known to increase the secretion in another because such an obstruction will in effect be the same as an actual increase of the fluids a consequence of which will be increased secretions it may also happen from the critical discharges of acute fevers lodging their malignity on these parts and from excesses of every kind falling on these parts and here it may be observed that such excesses will chiefly affect those parts which are by constitution the weakest and the disorder produced will correspond with the nature and office of that organical part which is affected  the glands may also be relaxed and the crasis of the blood broke by mercurial salivations by a long continued use of powerful deobstruent medicines and the kidneys in particulr by an improper use of such as are styled diuretic  an habitual drinking of spirituous liquors will also bring on the same ill effects and may in some circumstances be the cause of a diabetes  but to explain the reason of this   it appears from several dr hales haemas p     experiments that all strong liquors not only contract the small arteries but also coagulate the fluids which are contained in them a consequence of these effects will be a stoppage of the secretions and if often produced a relaxation of the fibers of the stomach and intestines hence will arise a failure of digestion and of course of nutrition when these necessary offices fail the solids will soon become weak and languid and the blood poor and watery the body then being brought to this deplorable state by such an abuse of them if we suppose the prevailing weakness to be in the kidneys which may happen to be the case either accidentally or constitutionally it is easy to conceive that a diabetes will come on opiates are known to act in the same manner and therefore will produce like effects  as the kidneys then may be relaxed by any preternatural pressure so it is easy to apprehend how a long suppression of urine be the cause of that suppression what it will should be productive of this disorder dr lib   obs   harris gives us an instance of such a cause of it in a case that fell under his own observation after having prescribed several medicines very unsuccessfully for his patient whose case was a total suppression of urine for five whole days the following cataplasm was ordered to be applied to the umbilical region of the sick person  sapon nigr vj croc opt ss sal succini gr xv f cataplasma the day following all the urinary springs appeared in a manner burst and a diluvium of sweet urine came on but was however soon stopped by the assistance of rhubarb chiefly this medicine was judged by reason of the warmth of it to be the best that could be adapted to the age of his patient who was seventy seven years old and by reason of the astringency of it to the nature of the disease there being no reason to think why it might not be of equal efficacy in a renal flux as well as an intestinal one seeing that the difference of the parts affected constituted the difference of the disorder in which observation there seems to be a great deal of truth  but to proceed  as a stone in the kidney by its great pressure or irritation will bring on a relaxation of its fibers so it may be the cause of this distemper  bonet pract anat tom   lib   sect    obs   bonetus gives us such an instance of it in one who dying of a diabetes was dissected and a stone found in the left kidney ren sinister lapide obsessus est angulos habente obtusos  lingua squallida and horridula aestus and sitis meiebat plus justo urina plane aquea sensim extabuit diabete interiit  the bites of some kind of animals particularly the a kind of serpent found in libya dipsas have been known to occasion this disorder the venomous juice of which animal i presume taken into the blood and received by the kidney will bring on a mortification of it that is a resolution or relaxation of its several component parts and then it is easy to conceive that a diabetes will ensue though i am more inclined to think it brought on by the drinking a large quantity of cooling acid liquors in order to appease the intolerable thirst consequent on the bite of this reptile  hypochondriacal complaints have sometimes been the forerunners of this disease the reason of this may easily be accounted for because as such disorders generally proceed from a weakness of the solids so by supposing the predominant weakness to be in the kidneys this disorder will necessarily be produced  a sphacelated tumor in the bladder or whatever causes a relaxation of its sphincter will be attended with plentiful discharges of urine hence some have imagined this distemper to be an affection of the multis ementitus diabetes causam ad affectionem renum referebant mortuis contracta plane vesica reperta est cum gangraena and tumore  in capacitate ipsius vesicae bonet obs   in loc prius cit bladder but very erroneously for it is reasonable to think that the flux of urine in all such cases will be involuntary which constitutes no part of this disorder and therefore does not properly come under the denomination of a diabetes  the kidneys and their secretory ducts being relaxed be the cause of that relaxation what it will a general debility of body will come on such is the close dependence that the several organical parts of the humane body bear to each other that if any one be in a diseased state the others will be affected by it every part of this complicated machine must regularly discharge its respective office in order to preserve the harmony or health of the whole in such a state of the body then as this there can neither be a due combination of the several parts of the blood nor a proper assimilation of the ingesta the consequences of which will be just now considered  having then enumerated the several causes by which the kidneys may be relaxed and the crasis of the blood broke we proceed to show how such a state of the body must necessarily bring on a diabetes  and here i shall beg leave to mention one disorder which seems to be in most respects analogous to this and that is a lacteal diabetes the learned and judicious dr boerhaaves acad lect v   p     boerhaave gives us an instance of such a disease there was he says a certain woman who dwelt at the city of dort who bore and suckled children for twelve years successively but at length she fell into a lacteal diabetes in which all the nourishment that was taken ran through her breasts without any suction under the appearance of milk insomuch that if she drank a pint of ale there was almost the like quantity of milk evacuated from her breasts  this instance then beautifully illustrates and strongly confirms the theory laid down  but to proceed  the first symptom that i shall take notice of by which a person is known to labor under a diabetes is the copious and frequent discharge of pale colored urine that this is an effect necessarily arising from such a state of the body will evidently appear from a little consideration the secretory ducts of the kidneys being in this relaxed morbid state they will readily admit those humors which in a natural state by reason of the compactness of their texture they would by no means give admittance to and consequently the discharge must be proportionably great the little stay the secreted humors make in the body will be the cause of their undergoing but a little change as to their color and rancidity seeing that the color and rancid smell of the urine when evacuated in a healthy state of the body are owing most probably to its long retention in it for by such a retention its oily parts become putrid and will of course put on a different complexion diabetical urine then is somewhat of a chylous nature and as all the nutritious juices are of a tenacious viscid disposition so they readily coagulate when exposed to the atmosphere and to this seems to be owing the reason of its ropy consistence  that the quantity evacuated should exceed in proportion the quantity of liquors taken in appears from what has been already observed for in this weaknd state of the kidneys and broken condition of the blood a great portion of those juices which should be retained in the body for its nourishment will be admitted to pass through the kidneys and of course be thrown out of it as though excrementitious to which may be added the actual increase of fluids arising from a general waste of the solids which the kidneys being now enlarged will greedily receive no wonder then that the quantity evacuated should exceed in proportion the quantity of liquors taken in a necessary consequence of such a discharge and because in such circumstances the important office of nutrition is in a manner suspended will be loss of flesh and a great waste of the body which is always observable when this disorder is far advanced and the patient almost brought by it to a period of his days and it frequently happens in this last stage of it that even solid pieces of flesh are brought away with the urine  the sense of weakness about the loins must be owing partly to this relaxation of the kidneys and partly to the evacuation made for in all drains whatever those parts of the body sustain the greatest loss of fluids which are nearest to that part from which the drain is made and will consequently be sensible of a proportionably greater weakness the same complaint is made in other fluxes in a gonorrhaea by men and the fluor albus by women and the reason of it in both cases is the same  the symptom that comes next to be accounted for is the sweetness of the urine  as a different configuration of the particles of the same body is well known to impress on the nervous papillae of the tongue different sensations we conclude and i think very reasonably that the difference of the tastes of bodies is owing to some different texture of their particles but as i apprehend it is no very easy matter to determine absolutely what particular disposition or combination of the several parts of which all bodies are known to consist is necessary to make a body either sweet or bitter so till this can be ascertained we must be contented with this general account of the sweetness of diabetical urine that it is owing to some different texture of its several heterogeneous parts  animal substances when putrefied give a faetid taste and the reason of this is ascribed not only to their natural disposition to give such a taste but also to some different modification of their parts acquired in the process of putrefaction chemistry teaches us that all bodies are composed of the same elements fire air water earth salt and oil and therefore the variety of their color smell taste and the like must be owing primarily to some different disposition of these elements we learn indeed from observation that the nearer the parts of any body approach to a sphaerical disposition the more mild and soft is the taste of that body and that the farther they recede from such a disposition the more acrid and rough is the sensation that such bodies excite in us  that the tastes of bodies do depend upon a different combination of their particles is a truth not to be disputed  mercury in its sphaerical figure is both innocent and tastless but when sublimed it loses its sphaericity and becomes acrid corrosive and poisonous  an entire mass of see mr boyles mechanical production of tastes silver is insipid but by being dissolved in aqua fortis and shooting into chrystalls it becomes bitter lead another tastless body dissolved in the same menstruum makes the solution sweet  a mixture of spirit of nitre and rectified spirit of wine the former highly corrosive the latter very pungent composes a body of an agreeable taste  it appears then from experiments that a different disposition of the particles of bodies is the cause of that variety of tastes which is observable in bodies and that it will also excite tastes in those bodies which before were insipid  we have hitherto accounted for the sweetness of diabetical urine upon no other principles than the original and primary cause of the difference of the tastes of natural bodies in general and into this indeed must all other accounts of it be at last resolved for could we know the various mixtures the urine may possibly undergo in this state of the body yet we should still be at a loss to give a reason for the alterations arising from such mixtures  but to be more particular  it is known from observation that the ingesta of what kind soever after they have been prepared and elaborated fine enough by the digestive organs to enter the lacteals are v boerhaaves acad lect v   p    sweet to the taste the milk which the infant sucks from the breasts of the mother is sweet and even the blood itself is relatively sweet it has been already observed that a long retention of the humors in the body is the sole cause of the rancidity of them and it has been also shown that in a diabetes part of those juices which should be retained in the body for its nutrition is thrown out of it as though excrementitious so that the urine in this disease is somewhat of a chylous nature and as the salt of chyle or milk is sweet so the taste of the urine must also be sweet seeing that it has not been long enough circulating in the vessels to acquire any degree either of rankness or acrimony this chylous nature then of the urine with a different combination of its several parts will easily account for its remarkable sweetness  that a diabetes should be attended with a hectic fever will appear evident from a consideration of the known causes of it but it would be foreign to my purpose to run through all the causes by which this kind of fever is produced and to show how necessarily a cachectical body must produce a hectic a very common cause of it however is an acrimony in the blood whether it be of the acid or alkaline kind which by irritating and fretting the solids will accelerate the circulation of the blood in the accelerated course of which is fixed the idea of a sever the same irritation will happen from an absorption of pus in case of an inward ulcer but whether or no there is such an absorption of pus is at present a disputed point though i think there is all the reason that can be desired to resolve it in the affirmative and chiefly because of that true purulent matter with which the faeces in ulcerated cases are sometimes known to be tinctured even when there has been no ulcer in these parts and theresore could not possibly have been evacuated by stool had it not been first absorbed into the blood that there are vessels in the humane body capable of such absorption is granted by every one that pestilential and other noxious efluvia are absorbed by them and communicated to the blood is often verified by fatal experience that the drops of blood which gush out from the rupture of a small artery are also absorbed into the mass of blood every days experience proves as it is clear then beyond all possible doubt that there is such an absorption of fluids into the blood i can see no reason why the pus which is discharged from an ulcer may not also be absorbed  that a great loss of blood will also bring on a hectic whether occasioned by haemorrhoidal or dysenterical fluxes too plentiful phlebotomy or the like appears from observation and is confirmed by experiment  the accurate and ingenious haemas v   exper   p    dr hales observed that the pulse of a horse upon which he was going to make an experiment beat forty strokes in a minute before he was disturbed or tied down but when the glass tube was fixed to the left crural artery it beat fixty five in a minute and as the horse grew fainter by the loss of blood the pulse was more and more accelerated so as to beat an hundred times or more in a minute whence we see that the pulse is weak and quick when the heart is supplied with little blood which is the case in the hectic fevers  but to explain the reason of the hectic when brought on by any great evacuation more fully  it is well known that the velocity with which all fluids move through all known vessels is reciprocal to the resistance which they meet with in their passage through such vessels now this resistance among other causes of it will be increased or diminished in proportion to the quantity of fluids contained in these vessels for the greater the quantity of fluids is contained for instance in those conical vessels the arteries the greater degree of force will be required in the blood thrown out of the heart to drive forward that already in the arteries and there will also be in such circumstances a greater degree of friction the quantity of blood then being diminished these resistances which are known to retard its progressive motion will be proportionably removed and the motion of the blood then will now be more free it will consequently be more quick and as a quick circulation will cause a quick pulse and as the pulse is denominated to be either strong or weak in proportion to the greater or less distension of the artery which depends upon the quantity or density of the blood so we may easily collect the reasons from these known facts both of the weakness and quickness of the pulse in hectic fevers and how preternatural fluxes of any kind are necessarily productive of a hectic from a diminution of the fluids or from a relaxation or dilatation of the glands in which circumstances the quantity of blood may be supposed to be diminished dr cheyne in his new theory of fevers has very ingeniously and fully demonstrated all the phenomenon of hectic fevers thus then we come to a reason of the hectic in a diabetes viz the relaxation of the kidney and the great evacuation made from it  the great thirst which is the last symptom that remains to be insisted upon is owing partly to this inward fever and partly to the great drain for in such a case the fauces will become dry and rough the dryness and roughness of which will excite in us that uneasy sensation which we call thirst  i have now gone through what i intended to insist upon and hope that the observations made though rudely digested will serve to throw some light into the nature of this disorder and into the reasons of the several phenomenon of it the symptoms indeed seem to flow necessarily from the causes assigned which is an argument in their favor  but as the cure of a disease is of far greater concern to mankind than the rationale of it though this should be first known to the skilful physician that he may the more effectually proceed to the removal of it it may not be improper briefly to point out the indications of cure which arise from the account given of it but i shall content myself by observing in general that medicines of a mild balsamic compacting nature seem to claim the first place as they will be well adapted to agglutinate the fluids and will moderately strengthen the weaknd part it is however often found necessary to make use of medicines of a more astringent nature if the weakness or relaxation of the kidney arises from an acrimony in the blood that acrimony is first to be corrected by proper rememies the greatest regard should be had in the cure of this as well as all other chronical diseases to a proper diet which in this case should undoubtedly be that of the incrassating kind a good regimen of the nonnaturals has been known to eradicate the most stubborn distempers when medicines of great efficacy have failed nor is this at all strange for seeing that most chronical disorders are owing to some bad disposition of the blood and the blood is made from what is taken into the body by way of food a proper regimen in such cases must surely be the best as well as the most natural alterative  that the bristol water is of remarkable service in this disorder experience abundantly testifies but the reason of its operation does not seem to be clearly understood neither shall i take upon me to give any account of it seeing that this is to be learnt only from knowing its ingredients and these are to be found out only by chemical experiments which are best made on the spot and the late accurate enquirer into its medicinal virtues intends to insist upon this point in the remaining part of his work but as it is well known to cool the body to thicken broken fluids and to strengthen in some degree so it seems to be well calculated to answer all the intentions of cure in this disorder  i shall only offer one word more in order to prevent any objection that may possibly be raised to this manner of enquiring into the nature of the diseases of the humane body  and here let it be remembered that the first improvement which the science of medicine received was made by reasoning upon mathematical principles this then paved the way for those great discoveries which have lately been made in the nature of the animal economy by the assistance of mechanical observations  dr meads preface to his book on poisons nor could malice itself as dr mead expresses himself on the like occasion deny this were not ignorance in confederacy with it which will secure any one from being benefitted by the most useful demonstration and that this is not only the most likely but is without all possible doubt the only certain method of improving physical knowledge is evident from the structure of the humane body for it appears by anatomy to consist of solids and fluids both which are subject to the known laws of matter and motion and therefore the various disorders to which this wonderful fabric is hourly liable can no way be more rationally accounted for than by mechanical reasonings and the application of these laws to such alterations as are observable in it  this method then of enquiring into the nature of the diseases of the humane body when it can be made use of is the only certain one i say when it can be made use of for there are some disorders of so complicated a nature others again of so peculiar a one that they are not capable of being considered in this advantageous light or of being reduced to any known principles whereon to found our enquiry all that can possibly be done in such unhappy cases is to be effected by a careful observation of the symptoms produced by a diligent attention to the efforts which nature endeavors to make for her own relief and by assisting her in the struggle by a due application of proper remedies  it is past doubt with me says in his account of the nonnaturals p     dr wainewright whatever some physicians say against theory which they dont understand that it is not only useful but a necessary qualification of a good physician for one that understands the structure of a humane body the nature of the solids and fluids the manner how animal actions are performed the nature of secretion the effect of either encreasng or lessening any evacuation the known laws of motion as applied to mechanics and hydrostaticks with the application of them to the alterations made in humane bodies is caeteris paribus better qualified for a physician than one who is ignorant of these things  finis
