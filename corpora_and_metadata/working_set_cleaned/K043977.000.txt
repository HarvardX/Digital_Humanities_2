where fixed in faith by holy patience blessed calm resignation yields the wretched rest where hope divine to penitence is given beams in each breast and lists the soul to heaven i sons of show ye unreflecting gay timetrifling youth the splendors of a day who lightly bounding over lifes surface skim monarchs of mode and worshippers of whim thus through the air the wingpoizd warbler sings wanton thus flies display their painted wings so struts the fowl with eyebespangled train like you self pleased as pretty and  as vain the time must come when dress and dancings over and your frail forms can

his taste alas  courtiers and clowns compose alike his feast what will avail the dimonds sparkling blaz the glare of titles or the vulgars gaze when wornout nature panting gasps for breath and friends fly frighted from the face of dea to the sad sense what then can give content the sweet reflection of a life well spent calm each great soul quits his claycumbrous springs to the skies and humbly waits his go while the low wretch by crime raised wealthg great starts at lifes loss and frightful meets his  wideopning wild he rowls his ghastful eyes he shakes he shrinks and agonizing cries have mercy heaven  can i its mercy share see griefstabd merit opes its bosom there hear from the grave the plaintive orphans groan bursts sorrowing forth and strikes the heavenly throne hark the lustruind fair extends her cries and the sound shakes along the trembling skies what shall we say in that great day of dread when the rent graves shall render back their dead when at the trumpets sound the clouds give way and the world blazes in eternal day there the fierce tyrant feels the avenging rod and pride sinks trembling at the sight of god there suffering virtue happiness receives there the fooled atheist though too late believes the poor lost sinner hears the eternal doom and woe appalled clings shuddring to his tomb bring ye bright fair your loveattending crow command your slain ye heroes from their shro ye prime in state display your deepest schemes and ye nice wits your fancyforming dreams try try ye proud in that tremendous hour the skill of science or the strength of power
