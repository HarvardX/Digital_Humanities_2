bust of homer opos    the iliad of homer  translated by mr pope  te sequor o graiae gentis decus inque tuis nunc fixa pedum pono pressis vestigia signis non ita certandi cupidus quam propter amorem quod te imitari aveo  lucret london printed by w bowyer for bernard lintott between the templegates       preface homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer whatever the praise of judgment virgil has justly contested with him and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellencies but his invention remains yet unrivaled nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry it is the invention that in different degrees distinguishes all great geniuss the utmost stretch of human study learning and industry which masters every thing besides can never attain to this it furnishes art with all her materials and without it judgment itself can at best but steal wisely for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature whatever praises may be given to works of judgment there is not even a single beauty in them but is owing to the invention as in the most regular gardens however art may carry the greatest appearance there is not a plant or flower but is the gift of nature the first can only reduce the beauties of the latter into a more obvious figure which the common eye may better take in and is therefore more entertained with and perhaps the reason why most critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one is because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through an uniform and bounded walk of art than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature  our authors work is a wild paradise where if we cannot see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater it is like a copious nursery which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants each according to his fancy to cultivate and beautify if some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity it is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature  it is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequaled fire and rapture which is so forcible in homer that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him what he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable every thing moves every thing lives and is put in action if a council be called or a battle fought you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third person the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the poets imagination and turns in one place to a hearer in another to a spectator the course of his verses resembles that of the army he describes  they pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it it is however remarkable that his fancy which is every where vigorous is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour it grows in the progress both upon himself and others and becomes on fire like a chariotwheel by its own rapidity exact disposition just thought correct elocution polished numbers may have been found in a thousand but this poetical fire this vivida vis animi in a very few even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected this can overpower criticism and make us admire even while we disapprove nay where this appears though attended with absurdities it brightens all the rubbish about it till we see nothing but its own splendour this fire is discerned in virgil but discerned as through a glass reflected and more shining than warm but every where equal and constant in lucan and statius it bursts out in sudden short and interrupted flashes in milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon fierceness by the force of art in shakespeare it strikes before we are aware like an accidental fire from heaven but in homer and in him only it burns every where clearly and every where irresistibly  i shall here endeavor to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts of his work as it is the great and peculiar characteristick which distinguishes him from all other authors  this strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful planet which in the violence of its course drew all things within its vortex it seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts and the whole compass of nature all the inward passions and affections of mankind to supply this characters and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination and created a world for himself in the invention of fable that which aristotle calls the soul of poetry was first breathed into it by homer i shall begin with considering him in this part as it is naturally the first and i speak of it both as it means the design of a poem and as it is taken for fiction  fable may be divided into the probable the allegorical and the marvelous the probable fable is the recital of such actions as though they did not happen yet might in the common course of nature or of such as though they did become fables by the additional episodes and manner of telling them of this sort is the main story of an epic poem the return of ulysses the settlement of the trojans in italy or the like that of the iliad is the anger of achilles the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events and crowded with a greater number of councils speeches battles and episodes of all kinds than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity the action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days virgil for want of so warm a genius aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject as well as a greater length of time and contracting the design of both homers poems into one which is yet but a fourth part as large as his the other epic poets have used the same practice but generally carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables destroy the unity of action and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his invention but they have followed him in every episode and part of story if he has given a regular catalogue of an army they all draw up their forces in the same order if he has funeral games for patroclus virgil has the same for anchises and statius rather than omit them destroys the unity of his action for those of archemorus if ulysses visit the shades the aeneas of virgil and scipio of silius are sent after him if he be detained from his return by the allurements of calypso so is aeneas by dido and rinaldo by armida if achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account if he gives his hero a suit of celestial armor virgil and tasso make the same present to theirs virgil has not only observed this close imitation of homer but where he had not led the way supplied the want from other greek authors thus the story of sinon and the taking of troy was copied says macrobius almost word for word from pisander as the loves of dido and aeneas are taken from those of medaea and jason in apollonius and several others in the same manner  to proceed to the allegorical fable if we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us how fertile will that imagination appear which was able to cloth all the properties of elements the qualifications of the mind the virtues and vices in forms and persons and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed this is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with homer and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his circle but for their judgment in having contracted it for when the mode of learning changed in following ages and science was delivered in a plainer manner it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside as it was in homer to make use of it and perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for virgil that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem  the marvelous fable includes whatever is supernatural and especially the machines of the gods if homer was not the first who introduced the deities as herodotus imagines into the religion of greece he seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry and such an one as makes its greatest importance and dignity for we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods constantly laying their accusation against homer as the undoubted inventor of them but whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view they are so perfect in the poetic that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful and after all the various changes of times and religions his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry  we come now to the characters of his persons and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many with so visible and surprising a variety or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them every one has something so singularly his own that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features than the poet has by their manners nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices the single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the iliad that of achilles is furious and intractable that of diomede forward yet listening to advice and subject to command we see in ajax an heavy and selfconsidering valor in hector an active and vigilant one the courage of agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition that of menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people we find in idomeneus a plain direct soldier in sarpedon a gallant and generous one nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character but even in the underparts of it to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one for example the main characters of ulysses and nestor consist in wisdom and they are distinct in this the wisdom of one is artificial and various of the other natural open and regular but they have besides characters of courage and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence for one in the war depends still upon caution the other upon experience it would be endless to produce instances of these kinds the characters of virgil are far from striking us in this open manner they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguished and where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of homer his characters of valor are much alike even that of turnus seems no way peculiar but as it is in a superior degree and we see nothing that differences the courage of mnestheus from that of sergesthus cloanthus or the rest in like manner it may be remarked of statiuss heroes that an air of impetuosity runs through them all the same horrid and savage courage appears in his capaneus tydeus hippomedon etc they have a parity of character which makes them seem brothers of one family i believe when the reader is led into this track of reflection if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers he will be convinced how infinitely superior in this point the invention of homer was to that of all others  the speeches are to be considered as they slow from the characters being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners of those who utter them as there is more variety of characters in the iliad so there is of speeches than in any other poem every thing in it has manners as aristotle expresses it that is every thing is acted or spoken it is hardly credible in a work of such length how small a number of lines are employed in narration in virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts which might be equally just in any persons mouth upon the same occasion as many of his persons have no apparent characters so many of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety we oftener think of the author himself when we read virgil than when we are engaged in homer all which are the effects of a colder invention that interests us less in the action described homer makes us hearers and virgil leaves us readers  if in the next place we take a view of the sentiments the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts longinus has given his opinion that it was in this part homer principally excelled what were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general is that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the scripture duport in his gnomologia homerica has collected innumerable instances of this sort and it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows that if virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar he has not so many that are sublime and noble and that the roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the iliad  if we observe his descriptions images and similes we shall find the invention still predominant to what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort where we see each circumstance and individual of nature summoned together by the extent and fecundity of his imagination to which all things in their various views presented themselves in an instant and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat nay he not only gives us the full prospects of things but several unexpected peculiarities and sideviews unobserved by any painter but homer nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battles which take up no less than half the iliad and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents that no one bears a likeness to another such different kinds of deaths that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner and such a profusion of noble ideas that every battle rises above the last in greatness horror and confusion it is certain there is not near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him and it is evident of virgil especially that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his master  if we descend from hence to the expression we see the bright imagination of homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it we acknowledge him the father of poetical diction the first who taught that language of the gods to men his expression is like the coloring of some great masters which discovers itself to be laid on boldly and executed with rapidity it is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable and touched with the greatest spirit aristotle had reason to say he was the only poet who had found out living words there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever an arrow is impatient to be on the wing a weapon thirsts to drink the blood of an enemy and the like yet his expression is never too big for the sense but justly great in proportion to it it is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction which rises with it and forms itself about it for in the same degree that a thought is warmer an expression will be brighter and as that is more strong this will become more perspicuous like glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a greater clearness only as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more intense  to throw his language more out of prose homer seems to have affected the compoundepithets this was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry not only as it heightened the diction but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images on this last consideration i cannot but attribute these to the fruitfulness of his invention since as he has managed them they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things they are joined to we see the motion of hectors plumes in the epithet  the landscape of mount neritus in that of  and so of others which particular images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description though but of a single line without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure as a metaphor is a short simile one of these epithets is a short description  lastly if we consider his versification we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that also he was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of greece but searched through its differing dialects with this particular view to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength what he most affected was the ionic which has a peculiar sweetness from its never using contractions and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables so as to make the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency with this he mingled the attic contractions the broader doric and the feebler aeolic which often rejects its aspirate or takes off its accent and completed this variety by altering some letters with the license of poetry thus his measures instead of being fetters to his sense were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture and even to give a farther representation of his notions in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified out of all these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not only the richest head but the finest ear in the world this is so great a truth that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses even without understanding them with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practiced in the case of italian operas will find more sweetness variety and majesty of sound than in any other language or poetry the beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but faintly by virgil himself though they are so just to ascribe it to the nature of the latin tongue indeed the greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its words and the turn and cadence of its verse which agree with the genius of no other language virgil was very sensible of this and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of and in particular never failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense if the grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the roman the only reason is that fewer critics have understood one language than the other dionysius of halicarnassus has pointed out many of our authors beauties in this kind in his treatise of the composition of words and others will be taken notice of in the course of the notes it suffices at present to observe of his numbers that they flow with so much ease as to make one imagine homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the muses dictated and at the same time with so much force and inspiriting vigor that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet they roll along as a plentiful river always in motion and always full while we are born away by a tide of verse the most rapid and yet the most smooth imaginable  thus on whatever side we contemplate homer what principally strikes us is his invention it is that which forms the character of each part of his work and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other his manners more lively and strongly marked his speeches more affecting and transported his sentiments more warm and sublime his images and descriptions more full and animated his expression more raised and daring and his numbers more rapid and various i hope in what has been said of virgil with regard to any of these heads i have no way derogated from his character nothing is more absurd or endless than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in them and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole we ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each it is in that we are to consider him and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him no author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty and as homer has done this in invention virgil has in judgment not that we are to think homer wanted judgment because virgil had it in a more eminent degree or that virgil wanted invention because homer possessed a larger share of it each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides and are only said to have less in comparison with one another homer was the greater genius virgil the better artist in one we most admire the man in the other the work homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity virgil leads us with an attractive majesty homer scatters with a generous profusion virgil bestows with a careful magnificence homer like the nile pours out his riches with a sudden overflow virgil like a river in its banks with a gentle and constant stream when we behold their battles methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate homer boundless and irresistible as achilles bears all before him and shines more and more as the tumult increases virgil calmly daring like aeneas appears undisturbed in the midst of the action disposes all about him and conquers with tranquillity and when we look upon their machines homer seems like his own jupiter in his terrors shaking olympus scattering the lightnings and firing the heavens virgil like the same power in his benevolence counselling with the gods laying plans for empires and regularly ordering his whole creation  but after all it is with great parts as with great virtues they naturally border on some imperfection and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends or the fault begins as prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion so may a great judgment decline to coldness and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness if we look upon homer in this view we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty  among these we may reckon some of his mavelous fictions upon which so much criticism has been spent as surpassing all the bounds of probability perhaps it may be with great and superior souls as with gigantick bodies which exerting themselves with unusual strength exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts to become miracles in the whole and like the old heroes of that make commit something near extravagance amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances thus homer has his speaking horses and virgil his myrtles distilling blood without so much as contriving the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability  it is owing to the same vast invention that his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances the force of this faculty is seen in nothing more than its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded it runs out into embellishments of additional images which however are so managed as not to overpower the main one his similes are like pictures where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects the same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath when his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent images the reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind  if there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius than an excess of it those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he lived in such are his grosser representations of the gods and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes which will be treated of in the following see the articles of theology and morality in the third part of the essay essay but i must here speak a word of the latter as it is a point generally carried into extremes both by the censurers and defenders of homer it must be a strange partiality to antiquity to think with madam dacier that preface to her homer those times and manners are so much the more excellent as they are more contrary to ours who can be so prejudiced in their favor as to magnify the felicity of those ages when a spirit of revenge and cruelty reigned through the world when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre when the greatest princes were put to the sword and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines on the other side i would not be so delicate as those modern critics who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of homer engaged there is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages in beholding monarchs without their guards princes tending their flocks and princesses drawing water from the springs when we read homer we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world and those who consider him in this light will double their pleasure in the perusal of him let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more that they are stepping almost three thousand years backward into the remotest antiquity and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things no where else to be found and the only authentic picture of that ancient world by this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish and what usually creates their dislike will become a satisfaction  this consideration may farther serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes such as the fardarting phoebus the blueeyd pallas the swiftfooted achilles etc which some have censured as impertinent and tediously repeated those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used they were a sort of attributes that it was a matter of religion to salute them with on all occasions and an irreverence to omit as for the epithets of great men mons boileau is of opinion that they were in the nature of surnames and repeated as such for the greeks having no names derived from their fathers were obliged when they mentioned any one to add some other distinction either naming his parents expressly or his place of birth profession or the like as alexander son of philip herodotus of halicarnassus diogenes the cynic etc homer therefore complying with the custom of his country used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry and indeed we have something parallel to these in modern times such as the names of harold harefoot edmund ironside edward longshanks edward the black prince etc if yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition i shall add a farther conjecture hesiod dividing the world into its ages has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one of heroes distinct from other men a divine race who fought at thebes and troy are called demigods and live by the care of jupiter in the islands of the blessed hesiod lib       etc  now among the divine honors which were paid them they might have this also in common with the gods not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet and such as might be acceptable to them by its celebrating their families actions or qualities  what other cavils have been raised against homer are such as hardly deserve a reply but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavor to exalt virgil which is much the same as if one should think to praise the superstructure by undermining the foundation one would imagine by the whole course of their parallels that these critics never so much as heard of homers having written first a consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other as when they prefer the fable and moral of the aeneis to those of the iliad for the same reasons which might set the odysses above the aeneis as that the hero is a wiser man and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed as because achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as aeneas when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character it is thus that rapin judges in his comparison of homer and virgil others select those particular passages of homer which are not so labored as some that virgil drew out of them this is the whole management of scaliger in his poetices others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original and then triumph in the aukwardness of their own translations this is the conduct of perault in his parallels lastly there are others who pretending to a fairer proceeding distinguish between the personal merit of homer and that of his work but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the iliad they found it upon the ignorance of his times and the prejudice of those that followed and in pursuance of this principle they make those accidents such as the contention of the cities etc to be the causes of his fame which were in reality the consequences of his merit the same might as well be said of virgil or any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation this is the method of mons de la motte who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age homer had lived he must have been the greatest poet of his nation and that he may be said in this sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him  in all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honor of the chief invention and as long as this which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself remains unequaled by his followers he still continues superior to them a cooler judgment may commit fewer faults and be more approved in the eves of one sort of critics but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment homer not only appears the inventor of poetry but excells all the inventors of other arts in this that he has swallowed up the honor of those who succeeded him what he has done admitted no increase it only lest room for contraction or regulation he showed all the stretch of fancy at once and if he has failed in some of his flights it was but because he attempted every thing a work of this kind seems like a mighty tree which rises from the most vigorous seed is improved with industry flourishes and produces the finest fruit nature and art have conspired to raise it pleasure and profit joined to make it valuable and they who find the justest faults have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of nature might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance  having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original it remains to treat of the translation with the same view to the chief characteristic as far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem such as the fable manners and sentiments no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions as it also breaks out in every particular image description and simile whoever lessens or too much softens those takes off from this chief character it is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimd and for the rest the diction and versification only are his proper province since these must be his own but the others he is to take as he finds them  it should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the greek it is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language but it is a great mistake to imagine as many have done that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviating into the modern manners of expression if there be sometimes a darkness there is often a light in antiquity which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal i know no liberties one ought to take but those which are necessary for transfusing the spirit of the original and supporting the poetical style of the translation and i will venture to say there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile dull adherence to the letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their author it is not to be doubted that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard as it is most likely to expire in his managing however it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole without endeavoring to be more than he finds his author is in any particular place it is a great secret in writing to know when to be plain and when poetical and figurative and it is what homer will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps where his diction is bold and lofty let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere english critic nothing that belongs to homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime others sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity methinks i see these different followers of homer some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds the certain signs of false mettle others slowly and servilely creeping in his train while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them however of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity no author is to be envied for such commendations as he may gain by that character of style which his friends must agree together to call simplicity and the rest of the world will call dullness there is a graceful and dignified simplicity as well as a bald and sordid one which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven it is one thing to be tricked up and another not to be dressed at all simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity  this pure and noble simplicity is no where in such perfection as in the scripture and our author one may affirm with all respect to the inspired writings that the divine spirit made use of no other words but what were intelligible and common to men at that time and in that part of the world and as homer is the author nearest to those his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer this consideration together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts may methinks induce a translator on the one hand to give into several of those general phrases and manners of expression which have attained a veneration even in our language from their use in the old testament as on the other to avoid those which have been appropriated to the divinity and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion  for a farther preservation of this air of simplicity a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet they have something venerable and as i may say oracular in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavoring to give them what we call a more ingenious that is a more modern turn in the paraphrase  perhaps the mixture of some graecisms and old words after the manner of milton if done without too much affectation might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work which most of any other seems to require a venerable antique cast but certainly the use of modern terms of war and government such as platoon campaign junto or the like which some of his translators have fallen into cannot be allowable those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language  there are two peculiarities in homers diction that are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects and those who are seem pleased with them as beauties i speak of his compoundepithets and of his repetitions many of the former cannot be done literally into english without destroying the purity of our language i believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an englishcompound without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets and are become familiar through their use of them such as the cloudcompelling jove etc as for the rest whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one the course to be taken is obvious some that cannot be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or two words may have justice done them by circumlocution as the epithet  to a mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated literally leafshaking but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis the lofty mountains shakes his waving woods others that admit of differing significations may receive an advantage by a judicious variation according to the occasions on which they are introduced for example the epithet of apollo  or farshooting is capable of two explications one literal in respect of the darts and bow the ensigns of that god the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the sun therefore in such places where apollo is represented as a god in person i would use the former interpretation and where the effects of the sun are described i would make choice of the latter upon the whole it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in homer and which though it might be accommodated as has been already shown to the ear of those times is by no means so to ours but one may wait for opportunities of placing them where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed and in doing this properly a translator may at once show his fancy and his judgment  as for homers repetitions we may divide them into three sorts of whole narrations and speeches of single sentences and of one verse or hemistich i hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand nor to offend the reader too much on the other the repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his words as in the messages from gods to men or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it in the solemn forms of prayers oaths or the like in other cases i believe the best rule is to be guided by the nearness or distance at which the repetitions are placed in the original when they follow too close one may vary the expression but it is a question whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any if they be tedious the author is to answer for it  it only remains to speak of the versification homer as has been said is perpetually applying the sound to the sense and varying it on every new subject this is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry and attainable by very few i know only of homer eminent for it in the greek and virgil in latin i am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance when a writer is warm and fully possessed of his image however it may be reasonably believed they designed this in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others few readers have the ear to be judges of it but those who have will see i have endeavored at this beauty  upon the whole i must confess my self utterly incapable of doing justice to homer i attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done we have only those of chapman hobbes and ogilby chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse notwithstanding which there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his he has frequent interpolations of four or six lines and i remember one in the thirteenth book of the odysses ver     where he has spun twenty verses out of two he is often mistaken in so bold a manner that one might think he deviated on purpose if he did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles he appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author insomuch as to promise in his rhyming preface a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in homer and perhaps he endeavored to strain the obvious sense to this end his expression is involved in fustian a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings as in the tragedy of bussyd amboise etc in a word the nature of the man may account for his whole performance for he appears from his preface and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn and an enthusiast in poetry his own boast of having finished half the iliad in less than fifteen weeks shows with what negligence his version was performed but that which is to be allowed him and which very much contributed to cover his defects is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation which is something like what one might imagine homer himself would have writ before he arrived to years of discretion hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general but for particulars and circumstances he continually lopps them and often omits the most beautiful as for its being esteemed a close translation i doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it which proceeds not from his following the original line by line but from the contractions abovementioned he sometimes omits whole similes and sentences and is now and then guilty of mistakes which no writer of his learning could have fallen into but through carelessness his poetry as well as ogilbys is too mean for criticism  it is a great loss to the poetical world that mr dryden did not live to translate the iliad he has left us only the first book and a small part of the sixth in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the sense or preserved the antiquities it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in he seems to have had too much regard to chapman whose words he sometimes copies and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original however had he translated the whole work i would no more have attempted homer after him than virgil his version of whom notwithstanding some human errors is the most noble and spirited translation i know in any language but the fate of great geniuss is like that of great ministers though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it  that which in my opinion ought to be the endeavor of any one who translates homer is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character in particular places where the sense can bear any doubt to follow the strongest and most poetical as most agreeing with that character to copy him in all the variations of his style and the different modulations of his numbers to preserve in the more active or descriptive parts a warmth and elevation in the more sedate or narrative a plainness and solemnity in the speeches a fullness and perspicuity in the sentences a shortness and gravity not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words nor sometimes the very cast of the periods neither to omit or confound any rites or customs of antiquity perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry what i would farther recommend to him is to study his author rather from his own text than from any commentaries how learned soever or whatever figure they make in the estimation of the world to consider him attentively in comparison with virgil above all the ancients and with milton above all the moderns next these the archbishop of cambrays telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author and bossus admirable treatise of the epic poem the justest notion of his design and conduct but after all with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work he must hope to please but a few those only who have at once a taste of poetry and competent learning for to satisfy such as want either is not in the nature of this undertaking since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern and a pedant nothing that is not greek  what i have done is submitted to the public from whose opinions i am prepared to learn though i fear no judges so little as our best poets who are most sensible of the weight of this task as for the worst whatever they shall please to say they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men but none as they are malignant writers i was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs and by persons for whom they can have no kindness if an old observation be true that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit mr addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as i cannot repeat without vanity i was obliged to sir richard steel for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public dr swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his friend the humanity and frankness of sir samuel garth are what i never knew wanting on any occasion i must also acknowledge with infinite pleasure the many friendly offices as well as sincere criticisms of mr congreve who had led me the way in translating some parts of homer as i wish for the sake of the world he had prevented me in the rest i must add the names of mr row and dr parnell though i shall take a farther opportunity of doing justice to the last whose goodnature to give it a great panegyric is no less extensive than his learning the favor of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection but what can i say of the honor so many of the great have done me while the first names of the age appear as my subscribers and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honor to the name of poet that his grace the duke of buckingham was not displeased i should undertake the author to whom he has given in his excellent essay the finest praise he ever yet received read homer once and you can read no more for all things else appear so mean and poor verse will seem prose yet often on him look and you will hardly need another book that the earl of halifax was one of the first to favor me of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example that such a genius as my lord bolingbroke not more distinguished in the great scenes of business than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning has not refused to be the critic of these sheets and the patron of their writer and that so excellent an imitator of homer as the noble author of the tragedy of heroic love has continued his partiality to me from my writing pastorals to my attempting the iliad i cannot deny my self the pride of confessing that i have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general but their correction of several particulars of this translation  i could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the earl of carnarvon but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them the right honorable mr stanhope the present secretary of state will pardon my desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair the particular zeal of mr harcourt the son of the late lord chancellor gave me a proof how much i am honored in a share of his friendship i must attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence and i am satisfied i can no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence  in short i have found more patrons than ever homer wanted he would have thought himself happy to have met the same favor at athens that has been shown me by its learned rival the university of oxford if my author had the wits of afterages for his defenders his translator has had the beauties of the present for his advocates a pleasure too great to be changed for any fame in reversion and i can hardly envy him those pompous honors he received after death when i reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations and easy friendships which make the satisfaction of life this distinction is the more to be acknowledged as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular parties or the vanities of particular men whatever the success may prove i shall never repent of an undertaking in which i have experienced the candor and friendship of so many persons of merit and in which i hope to pass some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others nor disagreeable to my self  opoc aactpic  opoc noix  koyene kponos iaias odysseia opos ythos istopia posis kooidia tpagydia phsis apt n gistis sophia  ex  antiquo in palatio   homaerium smyrnaeum    opoc cypnaion  opoc aastpianon    maps of greece and phrygia graecia homerica phrygia cum oris maritimus   an essay on the life writings and learning of homer there is something in the mind of man which goes beyond bare curiosity and even carries us on to a shadow of friendship with those great geniuss whom we have known to excel in former ages nor will it appear less to any one who considers how much it partakes of the nature of friendship how it compounds itself of an admiration raised by what we meet with concerning them a tendency to be farther acquainted with them by gathering every circumstance of their lives a kind of complacency in their company when we retire to enjoy what they have left an union with them in those sentiments they approve and an endeavor to defend them when we think they are injuriously attacked or even sometimes with too partial an affection  there is also in mankind a spirit of envy or opposition which makes them uneasy to see others of the same species seated far above them in a sort of perfection and this at least so far as we speak of the fame of writers has not always been known to dye with a man entirely but to pursue his remains with idle traditions and weak conjectures so that his name which is not to be forgotten shall be preserved only to be stained and blotted the controversy which was carried on between the author and his enemies while he yet was living shall still be kept on foot not entirely upon his own account but on theirs who live after him some being fond to praise extravagantly and others as rashly eager to contradict his admirers this proceeding on both sides gives us an image of the first descriptions of war such as the iliad affords where a hero disputes the field with an army til it is his time to dye and then the battle which we expected to fall of course is renewed about the body his friends contending that they may embalm and honor it his enemies that they may cast it to the dogs and vultures  there are yet others of a low kind of taste who without any malignity to the character of a great author lessen the dignity of their subject by insisting too meanly upon little particularities they imagine it the part of an historian to omit nothing they meet concerning him whom they write upon and gather every thing wherein he is named without any distinction to the prejudice or neglect of the more noble parts of his character like those trifling painters or sculptors who bestow infinite pains and patience upon the most insignificant parts of a figure till they sink the grandeur of the whole by finishing every thing with the neatest want of judgment  besides these there is a fourth sort of men who pretend to divest themselves of impetuous emotions on both sides and to get above that imperfect idea of their subject which little writers fall into who propose to themselves a calm search after truth and a rational adherence to probability in their historical collections who neither wish to be led into the fables of poetry nor are willing to support the falsehoods of a malignant criticism but endeavoring to steer in a middle way have obtained a character of failing least in the choice of materials for history even from the darkest ages  being therefore to write something concerning a life which there is little prospect of our knowing after it has been the fruitless enquiry of so many ages and which has however been thus differently treated by historians i shall endeavor to speak of it not as a certainty but as the tradition opinion or collection of authors who have been supposed to write of homer in these four preceding methods to which we shall also add some farther conjectures of our own after his life has been thus rather spoken of than discovered i shall consider him historically as an author with regard to those works which he has left behind him in doing which we may trace the degrees of esteem they have obtained in different periods of time and regulate our present opinion of them by a view of that age in which they were written  i stories of homer which are the effects of extravagant admiration i if we take a view of homer in those fabulous traditions which the admiration of the ancient heathens has occasioned we find them running to superstition and multiplied and independent on one another in the different accounts which are given with respect to egypt and greece the two native countries of fable  we have one in eustathius in od    eustathius most strangely framed which alexander paphius has reported concerning homers birth and infancy that he was born in egypt of dmasagoras and aethra and brought up by a daughter of orus the priest of isis who was herself a prophetess and from whose breasts drops of honey would frequently distill into the mouth of the infant in the nightime the first sounds he uttered were the notes of nine several birds in the morning he was found playing with nine doves in the bed the sybil who attended him used to be seized with a poetical fury and utter verses in which she commanded dmasagoras to build a temple to the muses this he performed in obedience to her inspiration and related all these things to the child when he was grown up who in memory of the doves which played with him during his infancy has in his works preferred this bird to the honor of bringing ambrosia to jupiter  one would think a story of this nature so fit for age to talk of and infancy to hear were incapable of being handed down to us but we find the tradition again taken up to be heightened in one part and carried forward in another heliod aethiop l   heliodorus who had heard of this claim which egypt put in for homer endeavors to strengthen it by naming thebes for the particular place of his birth he allows too that a priest was his reputed father but that his real father according to the opinion of egypt was mercury he says that when the priest was celebrating the rites of his country and therefore slept with his wife in the temple the god had knowledge of her and begot homer that he was born with tufts of hair on his  femur thigh as a sign of unlawful generation from whence he was called homer by the nations through which he wandered that he himself was the occasion why this story of his divine extraction is unknown because he neither told his name race nor country being ashamed of his exile to which his reputed father drove him from among the consecrated youths on account of that mark which their priests esteemed a testimony of an incestuous birth  these are the extravagant stories by which men who have not been able to express how much they admire him transcend the bounds of probability to say something extraordinary the mind that becomes dazzled with the sight of his performances loses the common idea of a man in the fansyd splendour of perfection it sees nothing less than a god worthy to be his father nothing less than a prophetess deserving to be his nurse and growing unwilling that he should be spoken of in a language beneath its imaginations delivers fables in the place of history  but whatever has thus been offered to support the claim of egypt they who plead for greece are not to be accused for coming short of it their fancy rose with a refinement above what we are supposed to have of their masters and frequently the veil of fiction is wrought fine enough to be seen through so that it hardly hides the meaning it is made to cover from the first glance of the imagination for a proof of this we may mention that poetical genealogy which is delivered for homers in the  greek treatise of the contention between him and hesiod and but little varied by the relation of it in suidas  the poet linus say they was born of apollo and thoose the daughter of neptune pierus of linus oeagrus of king pierus and the nymph methone orpheus of oeagrus and the muse calliope from orpheus came othrys from him harmonides from him philoterpus from him euphemus from him epiphrades who begot menalops the father of dius dius had hesiod the poet and perses by pucamede the daughter of apollo then perses had maeon on whose daughter crytheis the river meles begot homer  here we behold a wonderful genealogy contrived industriously to raise our idea to the highest where gods goddesses muses kings and poets link in a descent nay where poets are made to depend as it were in clusters upon the same stalk beneath one another if we consider too that harmonides is derived from harmony philoterpus from love of delight euphemus from beautiful diction epiphrades from intelligence and pucamede from prudence it may not be improbable but the inventors meant by a fiction of this nature to turn such qualifications into persons as were agreeable to his character for whom the line was drawn so that every thing divine or great will thus come together by the extravagant indulgence of fancy while it turns itself sometimes to admiration and sometimes to allegory  after this fabulous tree of his pedigree we may regularly view him in one passage concerning his birth which though it differs in a circumstance from what has been here delivered yet carries on the same air and regards the same traditions there is a short life of homer attributed to plutarch wherein a third part of aristotle on poetry which is now lost is quoted for an account of his uncommon birth in this manner at the time when neleus the son of codrus led the colony which was sent into ionia there was in the island of io a young girl compressed by a genius who delighted to associate with the muses and share in their consorts she finding herself with child and being touched with the shame of what had happened to her removed from thence to a place called aegina there she was taken in an excursion made by robbers and being brought to smyrna which was then under the lydians they gave her to maeon the king who married her upon account of her beauty but while she walked on the bank of the river meles she brought forth homer and expired the infant was taken by maeon and bred up as his son till the death of that prince and from this point of the story the poet is let down into his traditional poverty here we see though he be taken out of the lineage of meles where we met him before he has still as wonderful a rise invented for him he is still to spring from a demigod one who was of a poetical disposition from whom he might inherit a soul turned to poetry and receive an assistance of heavenly inspiration  in his life the most general tradition concerning him is his blindness yet there are some who will not allow even this to have happened after the manner in which it falls upon other men chance and sickness are excluded nothing less than gods and heroes must be visibly concerned about him thus we find among the different accounts which hermias in phaed plat leo allat de patr hom c  hermias has collected concerning his blindness that when homer resolved to write of achilles he had an exceeding desire to fill his mind with a just idea of so glorious a hero wherefore having paid all due honors at his tomb he entreats that he may obtain a sight of him the hero grants his poets petition and rises in a glorious suit of armor which cast so unsufferable a splendour that homer lost his eyes while he gazed for the enlargement of his notions  if this be any thing more than a mere fable one would be apt to imagine it insinuated his contracting a blindness by too intense an application while he wrote his iliad but it is a very pompous way of letting us into the knowledge of so short a truth it looks as if men imagined the lives of poets should be poetically written that to speak plainly of them were to speak contemptibly or that we debase them when they are placed in less glorious company than those exalted spirits which they themselves have been fond to celebrate we may however in some measure be reconciled to this last idle fable for having occasioned so beautiful an episode in the ambra of politian that which does not inform us in a history may please us in its proper sphere of poetry  ii stories of homer proceeding from envy ii such stories as these have been the effects of a superstitious fondness and of our astonishment at what we consider in a view of perfection but neither have all men the same taste nor do they equally submit to the superiority of others nor bear that human nature which they know to be imperfect should be praised in an extreme without opposition from some principles of this kind have arisen a second sort of stories which glance at homer with malignant suppositions and endeavor to throw a diminishing air over his life as a kind of answer to those who sought to aggrandize him injudiciously  under this head we may reckon those ungrounded conjectures with which his adversaries asperse the very design and prosecution of his travels when they insinuate that they were one continued search after authors who had written before him and particularly upon the same subject in order to destroy them or to rob them of their inventions  thus we read in diod sic l   diodorus siculus that there was one daphne the daughter of tiresias who from her inspirations obtained the title of a sybil she had a very extraordinary genius and being made priestess at delphos wrote oracles with wonderful elegance which homer sought for and adorned his poems with several of her verses but she is placed so far in the fabulous age of the world that nothing can be averred of her and as for the verses now ascribed to the sybils they are more modern than to be able to confirm the story which as it is universally assented to discovers that whatever there is in them in common with homer the compilers have rather taken from him perhaps to strengthen the authority of their work by the protection of this tradition  the next insinuation we hear is from suidas that palamedes who fought at troy was famous for poetry and wrote concerning that war in the dorick letter which he invented probably much against agamemnon and ulysses his mortal enemies upon this account some have fancied his works were suppressed by agamemnons posterity or that their entire destruction was contrived and effected by homer when he undertook the same subject but surely the works of so considerable a man when they had been able to bear up so long a time as that which passed between the siege of troy and the flourishing of homer must have been too much dispersed for one of so mean a condition as he is represented to have destroyed in every place though he had been never so much assisted by the vigilant temper of envy and we may say too that what might have been capable of raising this principle in him must be capable of being in some measure esteemed and of having at least one line of it preserved to us  after him in the order of time we meet with a whole set of names to whom the maligners of homer would have him obliged without being able to prove their assertion suidas mentions corinnus iliensis the secretary of palamedes who writ a poem upon the same subject but no one is produced as having seen it tzetzes chil   hist    tzetzes mentions and from johannes melala only sisyphus the coan secretary of teucer but it is not so much as known if he writ verse or prose besides these are dictys the cretan secretary to idomeneus and dares the phrygian an attendant of hector who have spurious treatises passing under their names from each of these is homer said to have borrowed his whole argument so inconsistent are these stories with one another  the next names we find are demodocus whom homer might have met at corcyra and phemius whom he might have met at ithaca the one as plutarch on music plutarch says having according to tradition written the war at troy the other the return of the grecian captains but these are only two names of friends which he is pleased to honor with eternity in his poem or two different pictures of himself as author of the iliad and odysses or entirely the children of his imagination without any particular allusion so that his usage here puts me in mind of his own vulcan in the iliad    iliad the god had cast two statues which he endued with the power of motion and it is said presently after that he is scarce able to go unless they support him  it is reported by some says ptol ephesians excerpt apud photium l   ptolomaeus ephestio that there was before homer a woman of memphis called phantasia who writ of the wars of troy and the wanderings of ulysses now homer arriving at memphis where she had laid up her works and getting acquainted with phanitas whose business it was to copy the sacred writings he obtained a sight of these and followed entirely the scheme she had drawn but this is a wild story which speaks of an egyptian woman with a greek name and who never was heard of but upon this account it appears indeed from his knowledge of the egyptian learning that he was initiated into their mysteries and for ought we know by one phanitas but if we consider what the name of the woman signifies it seems only as if from being used in a figurative expression it had been mistaken afterward for a proper name and then the meaning will be that having gathered as much information concerning the grecian and trojan story as he could be furnished with from the accounts of egypt which were generally mixed with fancy and fable he wrought out his plans of the iliad and the odysses  we pass all these stories together with the little iliad of siagrus mentioned by aelian l    c    aelian but one cannot leave this subject without reflecting on the depreciating humor and odd industry of man which shows itself in raising such a number of insinuations that clash with each other and in spiriting up such a crowd of unwarranted names to support them nor can we but admire at the contradictory nature of this proceeding that names of works which either never were in being or never worthy to live should be produced only to persuade us that the most lasting and beautiful poem of the ancients was taken out of them a beggar might be content to patch up a garment with such shreds as the world throws away but it is never to be imagined an emperor would make his robes of them  after homer had spent a considerable time in travel we find him toward his age introduced to such an action as tends to his disparagement it is not enough to accuse him for spoiling the dead they raise a living author by whom he must be baffled in that qualification on which his fame is founded  there is in hesiod op and dicrum l   v     etc hesiod an account of an ancient poetical contention at the funeral of amphidamas in which he says he obtained the prize but does not mention from whom he carried it there is also among the hom hymn   ad venerem hymns ascribed to homer a prayer to venus for success in a poetical dispute but it neither mentions where nor against whom but though they have neglected to name their antagonists others have since taken care to fill up the stories by putting them together the making two such considerable names in poetry engage carries an amusing pomp in it like making two heroes of the first rank enter the lists of combat and if homer and hesiod had their parties among the grammarians here was an excellent opportunity for hesiods favorers to make a sacrifice of homer hence might a bare conjecture spread into a tradition then the tradition give occasion to an epigram which is yet extant and again the epigram for want of knowing the time it was writ in be alleged as a proof of that conjecture from whence it sprung after this a  whole treatise was written upon it which appears not very ancient because it mentions adrian the story agrees in the main with the short account we find in plut banquet of the seven wise men plutarch that  ganictor the son of amphidamas king of euboea being used to celebrate his fathers funeral games invited from all parts men famous for strength and wisdom among these homer and hesiod arrived at chalcis the king panidas presided over the contest which being finished he decreed the tripos to hesiod with this elogy in the sentence that the poet of peace and husbandry better deserved to be crowned than he who stirs us up to war and contention whereupon hesiod dedicated the prize to the muses with this inscription   which are two lines taken from that place in hesiod where he mentions no antagonist and altered that the two names might be brought in as is evident by comparing them with these     to answer this story we take notice that hesiod is generally placed after homer graevius his own commentator sets him a hundred years lower and whether he were so or no yet plut symp l     plutarch has slightly passed the whole account as a fable nay we may draw an argument against it from hesiod himself he had a love of fame which caused him to engage at the funeral games and which went so far as to make him record his conquest in his own works had he defeated homer the same principle would have made him mention a name that could have secured his own to immortality a poet who records his glory would not omit the noblest circumstance and homer like a captive prince had certainly graced the triumph of his adversary  toward the latter end of his life there is another story invented which makes him conclude it in a manner altogether beneath the greatness of a genius we find in the life said to be written by plutarch a tradition that he was warned by an oracle to beware of the young mens riddle this remained long obscure to him til he arrived at the island io there as he sat to behold the fishermen they proposed to him a riddle in verse which he being unable to answer died for grief this story refutes itself by carrying superstition at one end and folly at the other it seems conceived with an air of derision to lay a great man in the dust after a foolish manner the same sort of hand might have framed that tale of aristotles drowning himself because he could not account for the euripus the design is the same the turn the same and all the difference that the great men are each to suffer in his character the one by a poetical riddle the other by a philosophical problem but these are actions which can only proceed from the meanness of pride or extravagance of madness a soul enlarged with knowledge so vastly as was that of homer better knows the proper stress which is to be laid upon every incident and the proportion of concern or carelessness with which it ought to be affected but it is the fate of narrow capacities to measure mankind by a false standard and imagine the great like themselves capable of being disconcerted by little occasions to frame their malignant fables according to this imagination and to stand detected by it as by an evident mark of ignorance  iii stories of homer proceeding from trifling curiosity iii the third manner in which the life of homer has been written is but a heaping of all the traditions and hints which the writers could meet with great or little in order to tell a story of him to the world perhaps the want of choice materials might put them upon the necessity or perhaps an injudicious desire of saying all they could occasioned the fault however it be a life composed of trivial circumstances which though it give a true account of several passages has but little of that appearance in which a man was most famous and hardly any thing correspondent to the idea we entertain of him such a life i say will never answer rightly the demand the world has upon an historian yet the most formal account we have of homer is of this nature i mean that which is said to be collected by herodotus it is in short an unsupported minute treatise composed of events which lie within the compass of probability and belong to the lowest sphere of life it seems through all its frame to be entirely conducted by the spirit of a grammarian ever abounding with extempore verses as if it were to prove a thing so unquestionable as our authors title to rapture and at the same time the occasions are so poorly invented that they misbecome the warmth of a poetical imagination there is nothing in it above the life which a grammarian might lead himself nay it is but such an one as they commonly do lead the highest stage of which is to be master of a school but because this is a treatise to which writers have had recourse for want of a better i shall give the following abstract  homer was born at smyrna about one hundred sixty eight years after the siege of troy and six hundred twenty two years before the expedition of xerxes his mothers name was crytheis who proving unlawfully with child was sent away from cumae by her uncle with ismenias one of those who led the colony to smyrna then building a while after as she was celebrating a festival with other women on the banks of the river meles she was delivered of homer whom she therefore named melesigenes upon this she left ismenias and supported herself by working til phemius who taught a school in smyrna fell in love with her and married her but both dying in process of time the school fell to homer who managed it with such wisdom that he was universally admired both by natives and strangers amongst these latter was mentes a master of a ship from leucadia by whose persuasions and promises he gave up his school and went to travel with him he visited spain and italy but was left behind at ithaca upon account of a defluxion in his eyes during his stay he was entertained by one mentor a man of fortune justice and hospitality and learned the principal incidents of ulyssess life but at the return of mentes he went from thence to colophon where his defluxion renewing he fell entirely blind upon this he could think of no better expedient than to go back to smyrna where perhaps he might be supported by those who knew him and have the leisure to addict himself to poetry but there he found his poverty increase and his hopes of encouragement fail so that he removed for cumae and by the way was entertained for some time at the house of one tychius a leatherdresser at cumae his poems were wonderfully admired but when he proposed to eternize their town if they would allow him a sallary he was answered that there would be no end of maintaining all the  or blind men and hence he got the name of homer from cumae he went to phocaea where one thestorides a schoolmaster also offered to maintain him if he would suffer him to transcribe his verses this homer complying with for mere necessity the other had no sooner gotten them but he removed to chois there the poems gained him wealth and honor while the author himself hardly earned his bread by repeating them at last some who came from chios having told the people that the same verses were published there by a schoolmaster homer resolved to find him out having therefore landed near that place he was received by one glaucus a shepherd at whose door he had like to have been worried by dogs and carried by him to his master at bollissus who admiring his knowledge entrusted him with the education of his children here his praise began to spread and thestorides who heard of his neighborhood fled before him he removed however some time afterward to chois where he set up a school of poetry gained a competent fortune married a wife and had two daughters the one of which died young the other was married to his patron at bollissus here he inserted in his poems the names of those to whom he had been most obliged as mentes phemius mentor and tychius and resolving for athens he made honorable mention of that city to prepare the athenians for a kind reception but as he went the ship put in at samos where he continued the whole winter singing at the houses of great men with a train of boys after him in spring he went on board again in order to prosecute his journey to athens but landing by the way at ios he fell sick died and was buried on the seashore  this is the life of homer ascribed to herodotus though it is wonderful it should be so since it evidently contradicts his own history by placing homer six hundred twenty two years before the expedition of xerxes whereas herodotus himself who was alive at the time of that expedition says homer was only herod l   four hundred years before him however if we can imagine that there may be any thing of truth in the main parts of this treatise we may gather these general observations from it that he showed a great thirst of knowledge by undertaking such long and numerous travels that he manifested an unexampled vigor of mind by being able to write with more fire under the disadvantages of blindness and the utmost poverty than any poet after him in better circumstances and that he had an unlimited sense of fame the attendant of noble spirits which prompted him to engage in new travels both under these disadvantages and the additional burden of old age  but it will not perhaps be either improper or difficult to make some conjectures which seem to lay open the foundation from whence the traditions which frame the low lives of homer have arisen in the first place we may consider that there are no historians of his time or none handed down to us who have mentioned him and that he has never spoken plainly of himself in those works which have been ascribed to him without controversy however an eager desire to know something concerning him has occasioned mankind to labor the point under these disadvantages and turn on all hands to see if there were any thing left which might have the least appearance of information upon the search they find no remains but his name and works and resolve to torture these upon the rack of invention in order to give some account of the person they belong to  the first thing therefore they settle is that what passed for his name must be his name no longer but an additional title used instead of it the reason why it was given must be some accident of his life having thus found an end of the clue they proceed to consider every thing that the word may imply by its derivation one finds that  signifies a thigh whence arises the tradition in hell l   heliodorus that he was banished egypt for the mark on that part which showed a spurious birth and this they imagine ground enough to give him the life of a wanderer a second finds that  signifies an hostage and then he must be delivered as such in a war according to proc vis hom proclus between smyrna and chios a third can derive the name  non videns from whence he must be a blind man as in the piece ascribed to herod vit hom herodotus a fourth brings him from  speaking in council and then as it is in suidas he must by a divine inspiration declare to the smyrnaeans that they should war against colophon a fifth finds the word may be brought to signify following others or joining himself to them and then he must be called homer for saying as it is quoted from plut vit hom aristotle in the life ascribed to plutarch that he would  or follow the lydians from smyrna thus has the name been turned and winded enough at least to give a suspicion that he who got a new etymology got a handle either for a new life of him or something which he added to the old one  however the name itself not affording enough to furnish out a whole life his works must be brought in for assistance and it is taken for granted that where he has not spoken of himself he lies veiled beneath the persons or actions of those whom he describes because he calls a poet by the name of phemius in his odysses they conclude this herod vit hom phemius was his master because he speaks of demodocus as another poet who was blind and frequented palaces he must be sent about ibid blind to sing at the doors of rich men if ulysses be set upon by dogs at his shepherds cottage because this is a low adventure it is thought to be his own at bollissus ibid and if he calls the leatherdresser who made ajaxs shield by the name of tychius he has been supported by such an one in his wants nay some have been so violently carried into this way of conjecturing that the bare vid m dacier s life of homer simile of a woman who works hard for her livelihood is said to have been borrowed from his mothers condition and brought as a proof of it thus he is still imagined to intend himself and the fictions of poetry converted into real facts are delivered for his life who has assigned them to others all those stories in his works which suit with a mean condition are supposed to have happened to him though the same way of inference might as well prove him to have acted in a higher sphere from the many passages that show his skill in government and his knowledge of the great parts of life  there are some other scattered stories of homer which fall not under these heads but are however of as trifling a nature as much unfit for the materials of history still more ungrounded if possible and arising merely from chance or the humors of men such is the report we meet with from diogenes lacrtius ex heracl in vita socratis heraclides that  homer was fined at athens for a madman which seems invented by the disciples of socrates to cast an odium upon the athenians for their consenting to the death of their master and carries in it something like a declaiming revenge of the schools as if the world should imagine the one could be esteemed mad where the other was put to death for being wicked such another report is that in aelian l   cap    aelian that  homer portiond his daughter with some of his works for want of money which looks but like a whim delivered in the gaiety of fancy a jest upon a poor wit which at first might have had an epigrammatist for its father and been afterward gravely understood by some painful collector in short mankind have labored heartily about him to no purpose they have caught up every thing greedily with that busy minute curiosity and unsatisfactory inquisitiveness which seneca calls the disease of the greeks they have puzzled the cause by their attempts to find it out and like travelers entirely destitute of a road yet resolved to make it over unpassable deserts they superinduce error instead of removing ignorance  iv probable conjectures concerning homer iv whenever men have set themselves to write a life of homer clear from superstition envy and trifling they have grown ashamed of all these traditions this however has not occasioned every one to desist from the undertaking but still the difficulty which could not make them desist has necessitated them either to deliver the old story with excuses or else instead of a life to compose a treatise partly of criticism and partly of character rather descriptive than supported by action and the air of history  his time they begin with letting us know that the time in which he lived has never been fixed beyond dispute and that the opinions of authors are various concerning it but the controversy in its several conjectures includes a space of years between the earliest and latest from twenty four to about five hundred after the siege of troy whenever the time was it seems not to have been near that siege from his own  iliad   invocation of the muses to recount the catalogue of the ships for we says he have only heard a rumor and know nothing particularly it is remarked by hic long a temporibus belli quod composuit troici quam quidam rentur abfuit nam ferme ante annos   0 floruit intra mill natus est quo nomine non est mirandum quod saepe illud usurpat  hoc enim ut hominum ita saeculorum notatur differentia vell paterc lib   velleius paterculus that it must have been considerably later from his own confession that mankind was but half as strong in his age as in that he writ of which as it is founded upon a notion of a gradual degeneracy in our nature discovers the interval to have been long between homer and his subject but not to trouble our selves with entering into all the dry dispute we may here take notice that the world is inclined to stand by the vide dacier du pin etc concerning the arundelian marble arundelian marble as the most certain computation of those early times and this by placing him at the time when diognetus ruled in athens makes him flourish a little before the olympiads were established about three hundred years after the taking of troy and near a thousand before the christian era for a farther confirmation of this we have some great names of antiquity who give him a cotemporary agreeing with the computation cicero qu tuscul l   cicero says there was a tradition that homer lived about the time of lycurgus strabo l  0 strabo tells us it was reported that lycurgus went to chios for an interview with him and even plut vita lycurgi plutarch when he says lycurgus received homers works from the grandson of that creophilus with whom he had lived does not put him so far backward but that possibly they might have been alive together  his country the next dispute regards his country concerning which  of adrian s oracle adrian inquired of the gods as a question not to be settled by men and appion according to plin l  0 cap   pliny raised a spirit for his information that which has increased the difficulty is the number of contesting places of which suidas has reckoned up nineteen in one breath but his ancient commentator seneca ep    concerning didymus didymus found the subject so fertile as to employ a great part of his four thousand volumes upon it there is a prophecy of the sybils that he should be born at salamis in cyprus and then to play an argument of the same nature against it there is the oracle given to adrian afterward that says he was born in ithaca there are customs of aeolia and egypt cited from his works to make out by turns and with the same probability that he belonged to each of them there was a school showed for his at colophon and a tomb at io both of equal strength to prove he had his birth in either as for the athenians they challenged him as born where they had a colony or else in behalf of greece in general and as the metropolis of its learning they made his name free of their city  qu licinia and mutia lege says politian pref in homerum politian after the manner of that law by which all italy became free of rome all these have their authors to record their titles but still the weight of the question seems to lie between smyrna and chios which we must therefore take a little more notice of that homer then was born at smyrna is endeavored to be proved by an epigram on pisistratus in the anonymous life before homer epigram recorded to have been under the statue of pisistratus at athens by the reports mentioned in cicero strabo and a gellius and by the greek lives which are prefixed to him with the names of herodotus plutarch and proclus as also the two that are anonymous for this the vitruvius proem l   smyrnaeans built him a temple cast medals of him and grew so possessed of his having been theirs that it is said they burned zoilus for affronting them in the person of homer on the other hand the chians plead the ancient authorities of simonides frag de brevitat vitae quoting a verse of homer  simonides and theocritus in dioscuris       theocritus for his being born among them they mention a race they had called the homeridae whom they reckoned his posterity they cast medals of him they show to this day an homaerium or temple of homer near bollissus and close their arguments with a quotation from the hymn to apollo which is acknowledged for homers by thucyd lib   thucydides where he calls himself the blind man that inhabits chiosthe reader has here the sum of the large treatise of leo allatius written particularly on this subject leo allatius de patria homeri  in which after having separately weighed the pretensions of all he concludes for chios for my part i determine nothing in a point of so much uncertainty neither which of these was honored with his birth nor whether any of them was nor again whether each may not have produced his own homer since xenophon de aequivocis xenophon says there were many of the name but one cannot avoid being surpised at the prodigious veneration of his character which could engage mankind with such eagerness in a point so little essential that kings should send to oracles for the enquiry of his birthplace that cities should be in strife about it and whole lives of learned men employed upon it that some should write treatises concerning it that others should call up spirits unavailingly that thus in short heaven earth and hell should be sought to for the decision of a question which terminates in curiosity only  his parents if we endeavor to find the parents of homer we immediately perceive the search is fruitless plut vita hom ex ephoro ephorus has made maeon to be his father by a niece whom he deflourd and this has so far obtained as to give him the derivative name of maeonides his mother if we allow the story of maeon is called crytheis but we are lost again in uncertainty if we search farther for suidas has mentioned eumetis or polycaste and pausanias l  0 pausanias clymene or themisto which happens because the contesting countries find out mothers of their own for him tradition has in this case afforded us no more light than what may serve to show its shadows in a confusion they strike the sight with so equal a probability that we are in doubt which to choose and must pass the question undecided  his name if we enquire concerning his own name even that is doubted of he has been called melesigenes from the river where he was born homer has been reckoned an ascititious name from some accident in his life the certamen homericum calls him once auletes perhaps from his musical genius and lucian s true history l   lucian tigranes it may be from a confusion with that tigranes or suidas de tigrete tigretes who was brother of queen artemisia and whose name has been so far mingled with his as to make him be esteemed author of some of the lesser works which are ascribed to homer it may not be amiss to close these criticisms with that agreeable derision wherewith lucian treats the overbusy humor of grammarians in their search after minute and impossible enquiries when he feigns that he had talked over the point with homer in the island of the blessed i asked him says he of what country he was a question hard to be resolved with us to which he answered he could not certainly tell because some had informed him that he was of chios some of smyrna and others of colophon but he took himself for a babylonian called tigranes while he lived among his countrymen and homer while he was an hostage among the graecians  his blindness at his birth he appears not to have been blind whatever he might be afterward the the medal is exhibited at the beginning of this essay chian medal of him which is of great antiquity according to leo allatius seats him with a volume open and reading intently but there is no need of proofs from antiquity for that which every line of his works will demonstrate with what an exactness agreeable to the natural appearance of things do his cities stand his mountains rise his rivers wind and his regions lie extended how beautifully are the surfaces of all things drawn in their figures and adorned with their paintings what address in action what visible characters of the passions inspirit his heroes it is not to be imagined that a man could have been always blind who thus inimitably copies nature who gives every where the proper proportion figure color and life  quem si quis caecum genitum putat says paterculus l   paterculus omnibus sensibus orbus est he must certainly have beheld the creation considered it with a long attention and enriched his fancy by the most sensible knowledge of those ideas which he makes the reader see while he but describes them  his education and master as he grew forward in years he was trained up to learning if we credit diod sic l   diodorus under one  pronapides a man of excellent natural endowments who taught the pelasgick letter invented by linus from him might he learn to preserve his poetry by committing it to writing which we mention because it is generally believed joseph cont apion l   no poems before his were so preserved and he himself in the third line of his batrochomuomachia if that piece be allowed to be his expressly speaks of    batroch writing his works in his tablets  his travels when he was of riper years for his farther accomplishment and the gratification of his thirst of knowledge he spent a considerable part of his time in traveling upon which account procl vita hom proclus has taken notice that he must have abounded in riches for long travels says he occasion high expenses and especially at those times when men could neither sail without imminent danger and inconveniences nor had a regulated manner of commerce with one another this way of reasoning appears very probable and if it does not prove him to have been rich it shows him at least to have had patrons of a generous spirit who observing the vastness of his capacity believed themselves beneficent to mankind while they supported one who seemed born for something extraordinary  egypt being at that time the seat of learning the greatest wits and geniuss of greece used to travel thither among these diod sic l   diodorus reckons homer and to strengthen his opinion alleges that multitude of their notions which he has received into his poetry and of their customs to which he alludes in his fictions such as his gods which are named from the first egyptian kings the number of the muses taken from the nine minstrels which attended osyris the feast wherein they used to send their statues of the deities into aethiopia and to return after twelve days and the carrying their dead bodies over the lake to a pleasant place called acherusia near memphis from whence arose the stories of charon styx and elysium these are notions which so abound in him as to make  herodot l   herodotus say he had introduced from thence the religion of greece and if others have believed he was an egyptian from his knowledge of their rites and traditions which were revealed but to few and of the arts and customs which were practiced among them in general it may prove at least thus much that he was there in his travels  as greece was in all probability his native country and had then began to make an effort for learning we cannot doubt but he traveled there also with a particular observation he uses the different dialects which were spoken in its different parts as one who had been conversant with them all but the argument which appears most irrefragable is to be taken from his catalogue of the ships he has there given us an exact geography of greece where its cities mountains and plains are particularly mentioned where the courses of its rivers are traced out where the countries are laid in order their bounds assigned and the uses of their soils specified which the ancients who compared it with the original have allowed to be so true in all points that it could never have been owing to a loose and casual information even strabos account of greece is but a kind of commentary upon homers  we may carry this argument farther to suppose his having been round asia minor from his exact division of the regnum priami vetus as horace calls it into its separate dynasties and the account he gives of the bordering nations in alliance with it perhaps too in the wanderings of ulysses about sicily whose ports and neighboring islands are mentioned he might contrive to send his hero where he had made his own voyage before nor will the fables he has intermingled be any objection to his having traveled in those parts since they are not related as the history of the present time but the tradition of the former his mention of thrace his description of the beasts of lybia and of the climate in the fortunate islands may seem also to give us a view of him in the extremes of the earth where it was not barbarous or uninhabited it is hard to set limits to the travels of a man who has set none to that desire of knowledge which made him undertake them who can say what people he has not seen who appears to be versed in the customs of all he takes the globe for the scene in which he introduces his subjects he launches forward intrepidly like one to whom no place is new and appears a citizen of the world in general  when he returned from his travels he seems to have applied himself to the finishing his poems however he might have either designed begun or pursued them before in these he has treasured up his various acquisitions of knowledge where they have been preserved through ages to be as well the proofs of his own industry as the instructions of posterity he might then describe his sacrifices after the aeolian manner or iliad   his leagues with a mixture of trojan and spartan ceremonies il       he could then compare the confusion of a multitude to that tumult he had observed in the icarian sea dashing and breaking among its crowd of islands he could represent the numbers of an army by those flocks of iliad       swans he had seen on the banks of the cayster or being to describe that heat of battle with which achilles drove the trojans into the river il       he could illustrate it with an allusion from cyrene or cyprus where when the inhabitants burned their fields the grasshoppers fled before the fire to perish in the ocean his fancy being fully replenished might supply him with every proper occasional image and his soul after having enlarged itself and taken in an extensive variety of the creation might be equal to the task of an iliad and an odysses  his old age and death in his age we hear he fell blind and settled at chios as he says in the hymn to apollo which as is before observed is acknowledged for his by thucydides and might occasion both simonides and theocritus to call him a chian strabo l  0 strabo relates that lycurgus the great legislator of sparta was reported to have gone to chios to have a conference with homer after he had studied the laws of crete and egypt in order to form his constitutions if this be true how much a nobler representation does it give of him and indeed more agreeable to what we conceive of this mighty genius than those spurious accounts which keep him down among the meanest of mankind what an idea could we frame to our selves of a conversation held between two persons so considerable a philosopher conscious of the force of poetry and a poet knowing in the depths of philosophy both their souls improved with learning both eminently raised above little designs or the meaner kind of interest and meeting together to consult the good of mankind but in this i have only indulged a thought which is not to be insisted upon the evidence of history rather tends to prove that lycurgus brought his works from asia after his death which procl vita hom proclus imagines to have happened at a great old age on account of his circumference of learning for which a short life could never suffice  his character and manners if we would now make a conjecture concerning the genius and temper of this great man perhaps his works which would not furnish us with facts for his life will be more reasonably made use of to give us a picture of his mind to this end therefore we may suffer the very name and notion of a book to vanish for a while and look upon what is left us as a conversation in order to gain an acquaintance with homer perhaps the general air of his works will become the general character of his genius and the particular observations give some light to the particular turns of his temper his comprehensive knowledge shows that his soul was not formed like a narrow chanel for a single stream but as an expanse which might receive an ocean into its bosom that he had the strongest desire of improvement and an unbounded curiosity which made its advantage of every transient circumstance or obvious accident his solid and sententious manner may make us admire him for a man of judgment one who in the darkest ages could enter far into a disquisition of human nature who notwithstanding all the changes which governments manners rites and even the notions of virtue have undergone could still abound with so many maxims correspondent to truth and notions applicable to so many sciences the fire which is so observable in his poem as to give every thing the most active appearance may make us naturally conjecture him to have been of a warm temper and lively behavior and the pleasurable air which every where overspreads it may give us reason to think that fire of imagination was tempered with sweetness and affability if we farther observe the particulars he treats of and imagine that he laid a stress upon the sentiments he delivers pursuant to his real opinions we shall take him to be of a religious spirit by his inculcating in almost every page the worship of the gods we shall imagine him to be a generous lover of his country from his care to extol it every where which is carried to such a height as to make plutarch de and poetis plutarch observe that though many of the barbarians are made prisoners or suppliants yet neither of these disgraceful accidents which are common to all nations in war ever happens to one greek throughout his works we shall take him to be a compassionate lover of mankind from his numberless praises of hospitality and charity if indeed we are not to account for em as the common writers of his life imagine from his owing his support to these virtues it might seem from his love of stories with his manner of telling them sometimes that he gave his own picture when he painted his nestor and as wise as he was was no enemy to talking one would think from his praises of wine his copious goblets and pleasing descriptions of banquets that he was addicted to a cheerful sociable life which horace takes notice of as a kind of tradition laudibus arguitur vini vinosus homerus ep    l   and that he was not as may be guessed of virgil from his works averse to the female sex will appear from his care to paint them amiably upon all occasions his andromache and penelope are in each of his poems most shining characters of conjugal affection even his helena herself is drawn with all the softnings imaginable his soldiers are exhorted to combat with the hopes of women his commanders are furnished with fair slaves in their tents nor is the venerable nestor without a mistress  it is true that in this way of turning a book into a man this reasoning from his works to himself we can at best but hit off a few outstrokes of a character wherefore i shall decline the carrying it into more minute points and conclude with one discovery which we may make from his silence a discovery extremely proper to be made in this manner which is that he was of a very modest temper there is in all other poets a custom of speaking of themselves and a vanity of promising eternity to their writings in both which homer who has the best title to speak out is altogether silent as to the last of them the world has made him ample recompense it has given him that eternity he would not promise himself but whatever endeavors have been offered in respect of the former we find our selves still under an irreparable loss that which others have said of him has amounted to no more than conjecture that which i have said is no farther to be insisted on i have used the liberty which is indulged me by precedent to give in my opinions among the accounts of others and the world may be pleased to receive them as so many willing endeavors to gratify its curiosity  catalogue of his works the only uncontestable works which homer has left behind him are the iliad and odysses the batrachomuomachia or battle of the frogs and mice has been disputed but is however allowed for his by many great authorities amongst whom statius pres ad sylu   statius has reckoned it like the culex of virgil a trial of his force before his larger performances it is indeed a beautiful piece of raillery in which a great writer may delight to unbend himself an instance of that agreeable trifling which has been at some time or other indulged by the finest geniuss and the offspring of that amusing and cheerful humor which generally accompanies the character of a rich imagination like a vein of mercury running mingled with a mine of gold  the hymns have been doubted also and attributed by the scholiasts to cynaethus the rhapsodist but notwithstanding the tradition neither thucyd l   thucydides lucian phalarid   lucian nor pausan boeotic pausanias have scrupled to cite them as genuine we have the authority of the two former for that to apollo though it be observed that the word  is found in it which the book de poesi homerica ascribed to plutarch tells us was not in use in homers time we have also an authority of the last for a paus messen hymn to ceres of which he has given us a fragment that to mars is objected against for mentioning  and that which is the first to minerva for using  both of them being according to the author of the treatise before mentioned words of a later invention the hymn to venus has many of its lines copied by virgil in the enterview between aeneas and that goddess in the first aeneid but whether these hymns are homers or not they are always judged to be near as ancient if not of the same age with him  the epigrams are extracted out of the life said to be written by herodotus and we leave them as such to stand or fall with it except the epitaph on midas which is of very ancient authority quoted without its author both by plat in phaed plato and longin   edit tollii longinus and according to laertius in vita cleobuli laertius ascribed by simonides to cleobulus the wise man who living long after homer answers better to the age of midas the son of gordias  the margites which is lost is said by arist poet cap   aristotle to have been a poem of a comic nature wherein homer made use of iambick verses as proper for raillery it was a jest upon the fair sex and had its name from one margites a weak man who was the subject of it the story is something loose as may be seen by the account of it still preserved in eustath in odyss  0 eustathiuss comment on the odysses  the cercopes was a satirical work which is also lost we may however imagine it was levelled against the vices of men if our conjecture be right that it was founded upon the ovid metam l    de cercop old fable of the cercopes a nation who were turned into monkies for their frauds and impostures  the destruction of oechalia was a poem of which according to eustathius hercules was the hero and the subject his ravaging that country because eurytus the king had denied him his daughter iole  the ilias minor was a piece which included both the taking of troy and the return of the graecians in this was the story of sinon which virgil has made use of arist poet cap    aristotle has judged it not to belong to homer  the cypriacks if it was upon them that nevius founded his ilias cypria as dac on arist poet cap    mr dacier conjectures were the loveadventures of the ladies at the siege these are rejected by herod l   herodotus for saying that paris brought helen to troy in three days whereas homer asserts they were long driven from place to place  there are also other things ascribed to him such as the heptapection goat the arachnomachia etc in the ludicrous manner and the thebais epigoni or second siege of thebes the phocais amazonia etc in the serious which if they were his are now to be reputed a real loss to the learned world time in some things may have prevailed over homer himself and left only the names of these works as memorials that such were in being but while the iliad and odysses remain he seems like a leader who though he may have failed in a skirmish has carried a victory for which he passes in triumph through all future ages  monuments coins marbles remaining of him the remains we have at present of those monuments antiquity had framed for him are but few it could not be thought that they who knew so little of the life of homer could have a right knowledge of his person yet had they statues of him as of their gods whose forms they had never seen  quinimo quae non sunt finguntur says pliny l    c   pliny pariuntque desideria non traditi vultus sicut in homero evenit but though the ancient portraits of him seem purely notional yet they agree as i think raph fabret explicatio veteris tabellae anaglyphae hom iliad fabretti has observed in representing him with a short curled beard and distinct marks of age in his forehead that which is prefixed to this book is taken from an ancient marble bust in the palace of farnese at rome  in bollissus near chios there is a ruin which was shown for the house of homer which leo allat de patria hom cap    leo allatius went on pilgrimage to visit and as he tells us found nothing but a few stones crumbling away with age over which he and his companions wept for satisfaction  they erected temples to homer in smyrna as appears from cicero pro archia cicero one of these is supposed to be yet extant and the same which they show for the temple of janus it agrees with strabo l    to  etc de smyrna strabos description a square building of stone near a river thought to be the meles with two doors opposite to each other north and south and a large niche within the eastwall where the image stood but m spon denies this to be the true homaerium  of the medals struck for him there are some both of chios and smyrna still in being and exhibited at the beginning of this essay the most valuable with respect to the largeness of the head is that of amastris which is carefully copied from an original belonging to the present earl of pembroke and is the same which gronovius cuperus and dacier have copies of but very incorrectly performed  but that which of all the remains has been of late the chief amusement of the learned is the marble called his apotheosis the work of archelaus of priene and now in the palace of colonna we see there a temple hung with its veil where homer is placed on a seat with a footstool to it as he has described the seats of his gods supported on each side with figures known for the iliad and the odysses the one by the sword the other by the ornament of a ship which denotes the voyages of ulysses on each side of his footstool are mice in allusion to the batrachomuomachia behind is time waiting upon him and a figure with turrets on its head which signifies the world crowning him with the laurel before him is an altar at which all the arts are sacrificing to him as to their deity on one side of the altar stands a boy representing mythology on the other a woman representing history after her is poetry bringing the sacred fire and in a long following train tragedy comedy nature virtue memory rhetoric and wisdom in all their proper attitudes  sect ii having now finished what was proposed concerning the history of homers life i shall proceed to that of his works and considering him no longer as a man but as an author prosecute the thread of his story in this his second life through the different degrees of esteem which those writings have obtained in different periods of time  it has been the fortune of several great geniuss not to be known while they lived either for want of historians the meanness of fortune or the love of retirement to which a poetical temper is peculiarly addicted yet after death their works give themselves a life in fame without the help of an historian and notwithstanding the meanness of their author or his love of retreat they go forth among mankind the glories of that age which produced them and the delight of those which follow it this is a fate particularly verified in homer than whom no considerable author is less known as to himself or more highly valued as to his productions  the first publication of his works by lycurgus the earliest account of these is said by plut vit lycurgi plutarch to be some time after his death when lycurgus sailed to asia there he had the first sight of homers works which were probably preserved by the grandchildren of creophilus and having observed that their pleasurable air of fiction did not hinder the poets abounding in maxims of state and rules of morality he transcribed and carried with him that entire collection we have now among us for at that time continues this author there was only an obscure rumor in greece to the reputation of these poems and but a few scattered fragments handed about till lycurgus published them entire thus they were in danger of being lost as soon as they were produced by the misfortune of the age a want of taste in learning or the manner in which they were left to posterity when they fell into the hands of lycurgus he was a man of great learning a lawgiver to a people divided and untractable and one who had a notion that poetry influenced and civilized the minds of men which made him smooth the way to his constitution by the songs of thales the cretan whom he engaged to write upon obedience and concord as he proposed to himself that the constitution he would raise upon this their union should be of a martial nature these poems were of an extraordinary value to him for they came with a full force into his scheme the moral they inspired was unity the air they breathed was martial and their story had this particular engagement for the lacedaemonians that it showed greece in war and asia subdued under the conduct of one of their own monarchs who commanded all the grecian princes thus the poet both pleased the lawgiver and the people from whence he had a double influence when the laws were settled for his poem then became a panegyric on their constitution as well as a register of their glory and confirmed them in the love of it by a gallant description of those qualities and actions for which it was adapted this made plutarch apoptheg cleomenes call him the poet of the lacedaemonians and therefore when we remember that homer owed the publication of his works to lycurgus we should grant too that lycurgus owed in some degree the enforcement of his laws to the works of homer  their reception in greece at their first appearance in greece they were not digested into a regular body but remained as they were brought over in several detached pieces called according to aelian l    cap    aelian from the subject on which they treated as the battle at the ships the death of dolon the valor of agamemnon the patroclea the grot of calypso slaughter of the wooers and the like nor were these entitled books but rhapsodies from whence they who sung them had the title of rhapsodists it was in this manner they began to be dispersed while their poetry their history the glory they ascribed to greece in general the particular description they gave of it and the compliment they paid to every little state by an honorable mention so influenced all that they were transcribed and sung with general approbation but what seems to have most recommended them was that greece which could not be great in its divided condition looked upon the fable of them as a likely plan of future grandeur they seem from thenceforward to have had an eye upon the conquest of asia as a proper undertaking which by its importance might occasion union enough to give a diversion from civil wars and by its prosecution bring in an acquisition of honor and empire this is the meaning of  isocrat paneg isocrates when he tells us that  homers poetry was in the greater esteem because it gave exceeding praise to those who fought against the barbarians our ancestors continues he honored it with a place in education and musical contests that by often hearing it we should have a notion of an original enmity between us and those nations and that admiring the virtue of those who fought at troy we should be induced to emulate their glory and indeed they never quitted this thought till they had successfully carried their arms wherever homer might thus excite them  digested into order at athens but while his works were suffered to lie in an unconnected manner the chain of story was not always perceived so that they lost much of their force and beauty by being read disorderly wherefore as lacedaemon had the first honor of their publication by lycurgus that of their regulation fell to the share of athens in the time of diog laert vit sol solon who himself made a law for their recital it was then that pisistratus the tyrant of athens who was a man of great learning and eloquence as quis doctior iisdem illis temporibus aut cujus cloquentia litteris instructior quam pisistrati qui primus homeri libros confusos antea sic disposuisse dicitur ut nunc habemus cic de orat l   vide ctiam ael l    cap    liban panegyr in jul anonymam homeri vitam fusius vero in commentatoribus dyon thracis cicero has it first put together the confused parts of homer according to that regularity in which they are now handed down to us he divided them into the two different works entitled the iliad and odysses he digested each according to the authors design to make their plans become evident and distinguished each again into twenty four books to which were afterward prefixed the twenty four letters there is a passage indeed in plato in hypparcho plato which takes this work from pisistratus by giving it to his son hypparchus with this addition that he commanded them to be sung at the feast called panathenaea perhaps it may be as leo allatius de patria hom cap   leo allatius has imagined because the son published the copy more correctly this he offers to reconcile so great a testimony as platos to the cloud of witnesses which are against him in it but be that as it will athens still claims its proper honor of rescuing the father of learning from the injuries of time of having restored homer to himself and given the world a view of him in his perfection so that if his verses were before admired for their use and beauty as the stars were before they were considered in a system of science they are now admired much more for their graceful harmony and that sphere of order in which they appear to move they became henceforward more the pleasure of the wits of greece more the subject of their studies and the employment of their pens  about the time that this new edition of homer was published in athens there was one cynaethus a learned rhapsodist who as the schol pind in nem od   scholiast of pindar informs us settled first at syracuse in that employment and if as leo allatius believes he had been before an assistant in the edition he may be supposed to have first carried it abroad but it was not long preserved correct among his followers they committed mistakes in their transcriptions and repetitions and had even the presumption to alter some lines and interpolate others thus the works of homer ran the danger of being utterly defaced which made it become the concern of kings and philosophers that they should be restored to their primitive beauty  the edition in macedon under alexander in the front of these is alexander the great for whom they will appear peculiarly calculated if we consider that no books more enliven or flatter personal valor which was great in him to what we call romantic neither has any book more places applicable to his designs on asia or as it happened to his actions there it was then no ill compliment in plut in vita alexandri aristotle to purge the iliad upon his account from those errors and additions which had crept into it and so far was alexander himself from esteeming it a matter of small importance that he afterward  strabo lib    assisted in a strict review of it with anaxarchus and calisthenes whether it was merely because he esteemed it a treasury of military virtue and knowledge or that according to a late ingenious conjecture he had a farther aim in promoting the propagation of it when he was ambitious to be esteemed a son of jupiter as a book which treating of the sons of the gods might make the intercourse between them and mortals become a familiar notion the review being finished he laid it up in a casket which was found among the spoils of darius as what best deserved so inestimable a case and from this circumstance it was named the edition of the casket  editions in egypt the place where the works of homer were next found in the greatest regard is egypt under the reign of the ptolomys these kings being descended from greece retained always a passion for their original country the men the books the qualifications of it were in esteem in their court they preserved the language in their family they encouraged a concourse of learned men erected the greatest library in the world and trained up their princes under grecian tutors among whom the most considerable were appointed for revisers of homer the first of these was suidas zenodotus library keeper to the first ptolomy and qualified for this undertaking by being both a poet and a grammarian a compounded character in which there was fancy for a discovery of beauties and a minuter judgment for a detection of faults but neither his copy nor that which his disciple aristophanes had made satisfying aristarchus whom ptolomy philometor had appointed over his son euergetes he set himself to another correction with all the wit and learning he was master of he restored some verses to their former readings rejected others which he marked with obelisks as spurious and proceeded with such industrious accuracy that notwithstanding there were some who wrote against his performance antiquity has generally acquiescd in it nay so far have they carried their opinion in his favor as to call a man an argue ambigue dictum mutanda notabit fiet aristarchus  horat ars poetica aristarchus when they meant to say a candid judicious critic in the same manner as they call the contrary a zoilus from that zoilus who about this time wrote an envious criticism against homer and now we mention these two together i fancy it will be no small pleasure to the benevolent part of mankind to see how their characters stand in contrast to each other for examples to future ages at the head of the two contrary sorts of criticism which proceed from good nature or from ill will the one was honored with the offices and countenance of the court the other vitruv l   in prooem when he applied to the same place for an encouragement amongst the men of learning had his petition rejected the one had his fame continued to posterity the other is only remembered with infamy if the one had antagonists they were obliged to pay him the deference of a formal answer the other was never answered but in general with those opprobrious names of thracian slave and rhetorical dog the one is supposed to have his copy still remaining while the others remarks are perished as things that men were ashamed to preserve the just desert of whatever arises from the miserable principles of ill will or envy  in syria and other parts of asia it was not the ambition of egypt only to have a correct edition of homer we find in the author vitae arati and suidas in arato life of the poet aratus that he having finished a copy of the odysses was sent for by antiochus king of syria and entertained by him while he finished one of the iliad we read too of others which were published with the names of countries such as the eustathius initio iliados massaliotick and synopick as if the world were agreed to make his works in their survival undergo the same fate with himself and that as different cities contended for his birth so they might again contend for his true edition but though these reviews were not peculiar to egypt the greatest honor was theirs in that universal approbation which the performance of aristarchus received and if it be not his edition which we have at present we know not to whom to ascribe it  in india and persia but the world was not contented barely to have settled an edition of his works there were innumerable comments in which they were opened like a treasury of learning and translations whereby other languages became enriched by an infusion of his spirit of poetry aelian l    cap    aelian tells us that even the indians had them in their tongue and the persian kings sung them in theirs persius sat   persius mentions a version into latin by labeo and in general the passages and imitations which are taken from him are so numerous that he may be said to have been translated by piecemeal into that and all other languages which affords us this remark that there is hardly any thing in him which has not been pitched upon by some author or other for a particular beauty  the extent and height of their reputation in the heathen world it is almost incredible to what an height the idea of that veneration the ancients paid to homer will arise to one who reads particularly with this view through all these periods he was no sooner come from his obscurity but greece received him with delight and profit there were then but few books to divide their attention and none which had a better title to engross it all they made some daily discoveries of his beauties which were still promoted in their different channels by the favorite qualities of different nations sparta and macedon considered him most in respect of his warlike spirit athens and egypt with regard to his poetry and learning and all their endeavors united under the hands of the learned to make him blaze forth into an universal character his works which from the beginning passed for excellent poetry grew to be history and geography they rose to be a magazine of sciences were exalted into a scheme of religion gave a sanction to whatever rites they mentioned were quoted in all cases for the conduct of life and learned by heart as the very book of belief and practice from him the poets drew their inspirations the critics their rules and the philosophers a defense of their opinions every author was fond to use his name and every profession writ books upon him till they swelled to libraries the warriors formed themselves by his heroes and the oracles delivered his verses for answers nor was mankind satisfied to have thus seated his character at the top of human wisdom but being overborn with an imagination that he transcended their species they admitted him to share in those honors they gave the deities they instituted games for him dedicated statues erected temples as at smyrna chios and alexandria and aelian l   cap    aelian tells us that when the argives sacrificed with their guests they used to invoke the presence of apollo and homer together  the decline of their character in the beginning of christianity thus he was settled on a foot of adoration and continued highly venerated in the roman empire when christianity began heathenism was then to be destroyed and homer appeared the father of it whose fictions were at once the belief of the pagan religion and the objections of christianity against it he became therefore very deeply involved in the question and not with that honor which hitherto attended him but as a criminal who had drawn the world into folly he was on one hand accused for having framed justin martyr admonit ad gentes fables upon the works of moses as the rebellion of the giants from the building of babel and the casting ate or strife out of heaven from the fall of lucifer he was exposed on the other hand for those which he is said to invent as when arnobius adversus gentes l   arnobius cries out this is the man who wounded your venus imprisoned your mars who freed even your jupiter by briareus and who finds authorities for all your vices etc mankind was vid tertull apol cap    derided for whatever he had hitherto made them believe and arnobius ibid eusebius praep evangel l    cap  0 plato who expelled him his commonwealth has of all the philosophers found the best quarter from the fathers for passing that sentence his finest beauties began to take a new appearance of pernicious qualities and because they might be considered as allurements to fancy or supports to those errors with which they were mingled they were to be depreciated while the contest of faith was in being it was hence that the reading them was discouraged that we hear ruffinus accusing st jerome for it and that st august confess l   cap    st austin rejects him as the grand master of fable though indeed the dulcissime vanus which he applies to homer looks but like a fondling manner of parting with him  this strong attack against our author obliged those philosophers who could have acquiescd as his admirers to appear as his defenders who because they saw the fables could not be literally supported endeavored to find a hidden sense and to carry on every where that vein of allegory which was already broken open with success in some places but how miserably were they forced to shifts when they made plutarch on reading the poets junos dressing in the cestos for jupiter to signify the purging of the air as it approached the fire or the story of mars and venus that inclination they have to incontinency who are born when these planets are in conjunction wit and learning had here a large field to display themselves and to disagree in for sometimes jupiter and sometimes vulcan was made to signify the fire or mars and venus were allowed to give us a lecture of morality at one time and a problem of astronomy at another and these strange discoveries which porphyrius de antro nymph etc porphyry and the rest would have to pass for the genuine theology of the greeks prove but as eusebii praepar evangel l   cap   eusebius terms it the perverting of fables into a mystic sense they did indeed often defend homer but then they allegorized away their gods by doing so what the world took for substantial objects of adoration dissolved before its eyes into a figurative meaning a moral truth or a piece of learning which might equally correspond to any religion and the learned at last had left themselves nothing to worship when they came to find an object in christianity  restoration of homer s works to their just character the dispute of faith being over ancient learning reassumed its dignity and homer obtained his proper place in the esteem of mankind his books are now no longer the scheme of a living religion but become the register of one of former times they are not now received for a rule of life but valued for those just observations which are dispersed through them they are no longer pronounced from oracles but quoted still by authors for their learning those remarks which the philosophers made upon them have their weight with us those beauties which the poets dwelld upon their admiration and even after the abatement of what was extravagant in his run of praise he remains confessedly a mighty genius not transcended by any which have since arisen a prince as well as a father of poetry  sect iii a view of the learning of homer s time it remains in this historical essay to regulate our present opinion of homer by a view of his learning compared with that of his age for this end he may first be considered as a poet that character which was his professedly and secondly as one endowed with other sciences which must be spoken of not as in themselves but as in subserviency to his main design thus he will be seen on his right foot of perfection in one view and with the just allowances which should be made on the other while we pass through the several heads of science the state of those times in which he writ will show us both the impediments he rose under and the reasons why several things in him which have been objected to either could not or should not be otherwise than they are  in poetry as for the state of poetry it was at a low pitch in the age of homer there is mention of orpheus linus and musaeus venerable names in antiquity and eminently celebrated in fable for the wonderful power of their songs and music the learned fabricius in his bibliotheca graeca has reckoned about seventy who are said to have written before homer but their works were not preserved and can be only considered if they were really excellent as the happiness of their own generation what sort of poets homer saw in his own time may be gathered from his description of od  st and od  th demodocus and phemius whom he has introduced as opportunities to celebrate his profession the imperfect risings of the art lay then among the extemporesingers of stories at banquets who were half singers half musicians nor was the name of poet then in being or once used throughout homers works from this poor state of poetry he has taken a handle to usher it into the world with the boldest stroke of praise which has ever been given it it is in the eighth odyssey where ulysses puts demodocus upon a trial of skill demodocus having diverted the guests with some actions of the trojan war  odyss l       etc all this says ulysses you have sung very elegantly as if you had either been present or heard it reported but pass now to a subject i shall give you sing the management of ulysses in the wooden horse just as it happened and i will acknowledge the gods have taught you your songs this the singer being inspired from heaven begins immediately and ulysses by weeping at the recital confesses the truth of it we see here a narration which could only pass upon an age extremely ignorant in the nature of poetry where that claim of inspiration is given to it which it has never since laid down and which is more a power of prophesying at pleasure ascribed to it thus much therefore we gather from himself concerning the most ancient state of poetry in greece that no one was honored with the name of poet before him whom it has especially belonged to ever after and if we farther appeal to the consent of authors we find he has other titles for being called the first joseph contra apion l r josephus observes that the greeks have not contested but he was the most ancient whose books they had in writing arist poet cap    aristotle says he was the first who brought all the parts of a poem into one piece to which he adds with true judgment to give him a praise including both the invention and perfection and horace acquaints us that he invented the very measure which is called heroic from the subjects on which he employed it res gestae regumque ducumque and fortia bella quo scribi possint numero monstravit homerus hor epist ad pisones     whatever was serious or magnificent made a part of his subject war and peace were the comprehensive division in which he considered the world and the plans of his poems were founded on the most active scenes of each the adventures of a siege and the accidents of a voyage for these his spirit was equally active and various lofty in expression clear in narration natural in description rapid in action abundant in figures if ever he appears less than himself it is from the time he writ in and if he runs into errors it is from an excess rather than a defect of genius thus he rose over the poetical world shining out like a sun all at once which if it sometimes make too faint an appearance it is to be ascribed only to the necessity of the season that keeps it at a distance and if he is sometimes too violent we confess at the same time that we owe all things to his heat  theology as for his theology we see the heathen system entirely followed this was all he could then have to work upon and where he fails of truth for want of revelation he at least shows his knowledge in his own religion by the traditions he delivers but we are now upon a point to be farther handled because the greatest controversy concerning the merit of homer depends upon it let us consider then that there was an age in greece when natural reason only discovered there must be something superior to us and tradition had affixed the notion to a number of deities at this time homer rose with the finest turn imaginable for poetry who designing to instruct mankind in the manner for which he was most adapted writ poems wherein he made use of the ministry of the gods to give the highest air of surprise and veneration to his writings he found the religion of mankind wrapped up in fables it was thought then the easiest way to convey morals to the people who were allured to attention by pleasure and awed with the opinion of a hidden mystery nor was it his business when he undertook the province of a poet not of a mere philosopher to be the first who should discard that which furnishes poetry with its most beautiful appearance and especially since the age he lived in by discovering its taste had not only given him authority but even put him under the necessity of preserving it whatever therefore he might think of his gods he took them as he found them he brought them into action according to the notions which were then entertained and in some stories as they were then believed unless we imagine that he invented every thing he delivers yet there are several rays of truth streaming through all this darkness in those sentiments he entertains concerning the gods and several allegories lightly veiled over from whence the learned drew new knowledges each according to his power of penetration and fancy but that we may the better comprehend him in all the parts of this general view let us extract from him a scheme of his religion  he has a jupiter a father of gods and men whom he makes supreme and to whom he applies several attributes as wisdom justice knowledge power etc which are essentially inherent to the idea of a god iliad        he has given him two vessels out of which he distributes natural good or evil for the life of man he places the gods in council round him he makes il       prayers pass to and fro before him and mankind adore him with sacrifice but all this grand appearance wherein poetry paid a deference to reason is dashed and mingled with the imperfection of our nature not only with the applying our passions to the supreme being for men have always been treated with this compliance to their notions but that he is not even exempted from our common appetites and frailties for he is made to eat drink and sleep but this his admirers would imagine to be only a grosser way of representing a general notion of happiness because he says in one place il     0 that the food of the gods was not of the same nature with ours but upon the whole while he endeavored to speak of a deity without a right information he was forced to take him from that image he discovered in man and like one who being dazzled with the sun in the heavens would view him as he is reflected in a river he has taken off the impression not only ruffled with the emotion of our passions but obscured with the earthy mixture of our natures  the other gods have all their provinces assigned em every thing has its peculiar deity says maxim tyrius diss    maximus tyrius by which homer would insinuate that the godhead was present to all things when they are considered farther we find he has turned the virtues and endowments of our minds into persons to make the springs of action become visible and because they are given by the gods he represents them as gods themselves descending from heaven in the same strong light he shows our vices when they occasion misfortunes like extraordinary powers which inflict them upon us and even our natural punishments are represented as punishers themselves but when we come to see the manner they are introduced in they are found feasting fighting wounded by men and shedding a sort of blood in which his machines play a little too grossly the fable which was admitted to procure the pleasure of surprise violently oppresses the allegory and it may be lost labor to search for it in every minute circumstance if indeed it was intended to be there the main design was however philosophical the dress the poets which is used for necessity and allowed to be ornamental and there will be something still to be offered in his defense if he has both preserved the grand moral from being obscured and adorned the parts of his works with such sentiments of the gods as belonged to the age he lived in which that he did appears from his having then had that success for which allegory was contrived it is the madness of man says maxim tyr diss    maximus tyrius to disesteem what is plain and admire what is hidden this the poets discovering invented the fable for a remedy when they treated of holy matters which being more obscure than conversation and more clear than the riddle is a mean between knowledge and ignorance believed partly for being agreeable and partly for being wonderful thus as poets in name and philosophers in effect they drew mankind gradually to a search after truth when the name of philosopher would have been harsh and displeasing  when homer proceeds to tell us our duty to these superior beings we find prayer sacrifice lustration and all the rites which were esteemed religious constantly recommended under fear of their displeasure we find too a notion of the souls subsisting after this life but for want of revelation he knows not what to reckon the happiness of a future state to any one who was not deifyd which is plain from the speech of odyss        achilles to ulysses in the region of the dead where he tells him that he would rather serve the poorest creature upon earth than rule over all the departed it was chiefly for this reason that plato excluded him his commonwealth he thought homer spoke indecently of the gods and dreadfully of a future state in which sentence he has made no allowance for the times he writ in but if he can not be defended in every thing as a theologist yet we may say in respect of his poetry that he has enriched it from theology with true sentiments for profit adorned it with allegories for pleasure and by using some machines which have no farther significancy or are so refined as to make it doubted if they have any he has however produced that character in poetry which we call the mavelous and from which the agreeable according to aristotle is always inseparable  politics if we take the state of greece at his time in a political view we find it a see thucydides lib   disunited country made up of small states and whatever was managed in war amounted to no more than intestine skirmishes or pyracies abroad which were easily revenged on account of their disunion thus one people stole europa and another io the graecians took hesione from troy and the trojans took helena from greece in revenge but this last having greater friends and alliances than any upon whom the rapes had hitherto fallen the ruin of troy was the consequence and the force of the asiatick coasts was so broken that this accident put an end to the age of pyracies then the intestine broils of greece which had been discontinued during the league were renewed upon its dissolution war and sedition moved people from place to place during its want of inhabitants exiles from one country were received for kings in another and leaders took tracts of ground to bestow them upon their followers commerce was neglected living at home unsafe and nothing of moment tranfacted by any but against their neighbors athens only where the people were undisturbed because it was a barren soil which no body coveted had begun to send colonies abroad being overstockd with inhabitants  now a poem coming out at so seasonable a time with a moral capable of healing these disorders by promoting union we may reasonably think it was designed for that end to which it is so peculiarly adapted if we imagine therefore that homer was a politician in this affair we may suppose him to have looked back into the ages past to see if at any time the disorder had been less and to have pitched upon that story wherein it found a temporary cure that by celebrating it with all possible honor he might instill a desire of the same sort of union into the hearts of his countrymen this indeed was a work which could belong to none but a poet when governors had power only over small territories and the numerous governments were every way independent it was then that all the charms of poetry were called forth to insinuate the important glory of an alliance and the iliad delivered from the muses with all the pomp of words and artificial influence union among themselves was recommended peace at home and glory abroad and lest this should be rendered useless by mismanagements he lets us into farther lessons concerning it how when his kings quarrel their subjects suffer when they act in conjunction victory attends them when they meet in council plans are drawn and provisions made for future action and when in the field the arts of war are described with the greatest exactness these were lectures of general concern to mankind proper for the poet to deliver and kings to attend to such as made porphyry write of the profit that princes might receive from homer and stratocles hermias and frontinus extract military discipline out of him thus though plato has banished him from one imaginary commonwealth he has still been serviceable to many real kingdoms  morality the morality of greece could not be perfect while there was a weakness in its government faults in politics are occasioned by faults in ethics and occasion them in their turn the division into so many states was the rise of frequent quarrels whereby men were bred up in a kind of rough untractable disposition bodily strength met with the greatest honors because it was daily necessary to the subsistence of little governments and that headlong courage which throws itself forward to enterprise and plunder was universally caressed because it carried all things before it it is no wonder in an age of such education and customs that as thucyd lib   thucydides says robbing was honored provided it were done with gallantry and that the ancient poets made people question one another as they sailed by if they were thieves as a thing for which no one ought either to be scorned or upbraided these were the sort of actions which the singers then recorded and it was out of such an age that homer was to take his subjects for this reason not a want of morality in him we see a boasting temper and unmanagd roughness in the spirit of his heroes which ran out in pride anger or cruelty it is not in him as in our modern romances where men are drawn in perfection and we but read with a tender weakness what we can neither apply nor emulate homer writ for men and therefore he writ of them if the world had been better he would have shown it so as the matter now stands we see his people with the turn of his age insatiably thirsting after glory and plunder for which however he has found them a lawful cause and taken care to retard their success by those very faults  in the prosecution of the story every part of it has its lessons of morality there is brotherly love in agamemnon and menelaus friendship in achilles and patroclus and the love of his country in hector but since we have spoken of the iliad as more particular for its politics we may consider the odysses as its moral is more directly framed for ethics it carries the hero through a world of trials both of the dangerous and pleasurable nature it shows him first under most surprising weights of adversity among shipwrecks and savages all these he is made to pass through in the methods by which it becomes a man to conquer a patience in suffering and a presence of mind in every accident it shows him again in another view tempted with the baits of idle or unlawful pleasures and then points out the methods of being safe from them but if in general we consider the care our author has taken to fix his lessons of morality by the proverbs and precepts he delivers we shall not wonder if greece which afterward gave the appellation of wise to men who settled single sentences of truth should give him the title of the father of virtue for introducing such a number to be brief if we take the opinion of qui quid sit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non before and melius chrysippo and crantore dicit hor ep   lib   horace he has proposed him to us as a master of morality he lays down the common philosophical division of good into pleasant profitable and honest and then asserts that homer has more fully and clearly instructed us in each of them than the most rigid philosophers  some indeed have thought notwithstanding all this that homer had only a design to please in his inventions and that others have since extracted morals out of his stories and indeed all stories are capable of being used so but this is an opinion concerning poetry which the world has rather degenerated into than begun with the traditions of orpheuss civilizing mankind by hymns on the gods with others of the like nature may show there was a better use of the art both known and practiced there is also a remarkable passage of this kind in the third book of the odysses that agamemnon left one of the odyss       poets of his times in the court when he sailed for troy and that his queen was preserved virtuous by his songs till aegysthus was forced to expel him in order to debauch her here he has hinted what a true poetical spirit can do when applied to the promotion of virtue and from this one may judge he could not but design that himself which he recommends as the duty and merit of his profession others since his time may have seduced the art to worse intentions but they who are offended at the liberties of some poets should not judge all in the gross for trifling or corruption especially when the evidence runs so strongly for any one to the contrary  we may in general go on to observe that the time when homer was born did not abound in learning for wherever politics and morality is weak it wants its peaceable air to thrive in and that opportunity which is not known in the ages of unsettled life he is himself the man from whom we have the first accounts of antiquity either in its actions or learning from whom we hear what egypt or greece could inform him in and whatever himself could discover by the strength of nature or industry but however that we may not mistake the elogies of those ancients who call him the father of arts and sciences and be surpised to find so little of them as they are now in perfection in his works we should know that this character is not to be understood at large as if he had included the full and regular systems of every thing he is to be considered professedly only in quality of a poet this was his business to which as whatever he knew was to be subservient so he has not failed to introduce those strokes of knowledge from the whole circle of arts and sciences which the subject demanded either for necessity or ornament this will appear on a fair view of him in each of these lights  history before his time there were no historians in greece he treated historically of past transactions according as he could be informed by tradition song or whatever method there was of preserving their memory for this we have the consent of antiquity they have generally more appealed to his authority and more insisted on it than on the testimony of any other writer when they treat of the rites customs and manners of the first times they have generally believed that the acts of tydeus at thebes the second siege of that city the settlement of rhodes the battle between the curetes and the aetolians the account of the kings of mycenae by the scepter of agamemnon the acts of the greeks at troy and many other such accounts are some of them wholly preserved by him and the rest as faithfully related as by any historian nor perhaps was all of his invention which seems to be feigned but rather frequently the obscure traces and remains of real persons and actions which as strabo l   strabo observes when history was transmitted by oral tradition might be mixed with fable before it came into the hands of the poet this happened says he to herodotus the first professed historian who is often as fabulous as homer when he defers to the common reports of countries and it is not to be reckoned to either as a fault but as a necessity of the times nay the very passages which cause us to tax them at this distance with being fabulous might be occasioned by their diligence and a fear of erring if they too hastily rejected those reports which had passed current in the nations they described  geography before his time there was no such thing as geography in greece for this we have the suffrage of strabo ibid initio strabo the best of geographers who approves the opinion of hipparchus and other ancients that homer was the very author of it and upon this account begins his treatise of the science itself with an encomium on him as to the general part of it we find he had a knowledge of the earths being surrounded with the ocean because he makes the sun and stars both to rise and set in it and that he knew the use of the stars is plain from his making odyss l       ulysses sail by the observation of them but the instance oftnest alleged upon this point is the iliad        etc shield of achilles where he places the earth encompassed with the sea and gives the stars the names they are yet known by as the hyades pleiades the bear and orion by the three first of these he represents the constellations of the northern region and in the last he gives a single representative of the southern to which as it were for a counterbalance he adds a title of greatness  then he tells us that the bear or stars of the arctick circle never disappear as an observation which agrees with no other and if to this we add what eratosthenes thought he meant that the five plates which were fastened on the shield divided it by the lines where they met into the five zones it will appear an original design of globes and spheres in the particular parts of geography his knowledge is entirely incontestable strabo refers to him upon all occasions allowing that he knew the extremes of the earth some of which he names and others describes by signs as the fortunate islands the same strabo l   author takes notice of his accounts concerning the several soils plants animals and customs as aegypts being fertile of medicinal herbs lybias fruitfulness where the sheep have horns and yean thrice a year etc which are knowledges that make geography more various and profitable but what all have agreed to celebrate is his description of greece which has had laws made for its preservation and contests between governments decided by its authority which strab l   strabo acknowledges to have no epithet or ornamental expression for any place that is not drawn from its nature quality or circumstances and professes after so long an interval to deviate from it only where the country had undergone alterations that cast the description into obscurity  rhetoric in his time rhetoric was not known that art took its rise out of poetry which was not till then established the oratorial elocution says strabo l   strabo is but an imitation of the poetical this appeared first and was approved they who imitated it took off the measures but still preserved all the other parts of poetry in their writings such as these were cadmus the milesian pherecydes and hecataeus then their followers took something more from what was left and at last elocution descended into the prose which is now among us but if rhetoric is owing to poetry the obligation is still more due to homer he as quintil l  0 cap   quintilian tells us gave both the pattern and rise to all the parts of it  hic omnibus eloquentiae partibus exemplum and ortum dedit hunc nemo in magnis rebus sublimitate in parvis proprietate superavit idem laetus and pressus jucundus and gravis tum copia tum brevitate admirabilis nec poetica modo sed oratoria virtute eminentissimus from him therefore they who settled the art found it proper to deduce the rules which was easily done when they had divided their observations into the kinds and the ornaments of elocution for the kinds the ancients says aulus gell l   cap    a gell settled them according to the three which they observe in his principal speakers his ulysses who is magnificent and flowing his menelaus who is short and close and his nestor who is moderate and dispassiond and has a kind of middle eloquence participating of both the former and for the ornaments arist topic aristotle the great master of the rhetoricians shows what deference is paid to homer when he orders the orator to lay down his heads and express both the manners and affections of his work with an imitation of that diction and those figures which the divine homer excelled in this is the constant language of those who succeeded him and the opinion so far prevailed as to make quintil l  0 quintilian observe that they who have written concerning the arts of speaking take from homer most of the instances of their similitudes amplifications examples digressions and arguments  natural philosophy as to natural philosophy the age was not arrived in which it flourished however some of its notions may be traced in him as when he says that the fountains and rivers come from the ocean he holds a circulation of fluids in the earth but as this is a branch of learning which does not lie much in the way of a poet who speaks of heroes and wars the desire to prove his knowledge this way has only run politian praesatio in hom politian and others into trifling inferences as when they would have it that he understood nature because he mentions sun rain wind and thunder the most probable way of making out his knowledge in this kind is by supposing he couched it in allegories and that he sometimes used the names of the gods as his terms for the elements as the chemists now use them for metals but in applying this to him we must tread very carefully not searching for allegory too industriously where the passage may instruct by example and endeavoring rather to find the fable an ornament to what is easily known than to make it a cover to curious and unknown problems  physic as for medicine something of it must have been understood in that age though it was so far from perfection that according to celsus lib   celsus what concerned diet was invented long afterward by hippocrates the accidents of life make the search after remedies too indispensible a duty to be neglected at any time accordingly he odvss l       tells us that the egyptians who had many medicinal plants in their country were all physicians and perhaps he might have learnt his own skill from his acquaintance with that nation the state of war which greece had lived in required a knowledge in the healing of wounds and this might make him breed his princes achilles patroclus podalirius and machaon to the science what homer thus attributes to others he knew himself and he has given us reason to believe not slightly for if we consider his insight into the structure of the human body it is so nice that he has been judged by some to have wounded his heroes with too much science or if we observe his cure of wounds which are the accidents proper to an epic poem we find him directing the chirurgical operation sometimes infusing il       and il    in fine lenitives and at other times bitter powders when the effusion of blood required astringent qualities  statuary for statuary it appears by the accounts of egypt and the palladium that there was enough of it very early in the world for those images which were required in the worship of their gods but there are none mentioned as valuable in greece so early nor was the art established on its rules before homer he found it agreeable to the worship in use and necessary for his machinery that his gods should be clothed in bodies wherefore he took care to give them such as carried the utmost perfection of the human form and distinguished them from each other even in this superior beauty with such marks as were agreeable to each of the deities this says strabo l   strabo awakened the conceptions of the eminent statuaries while they strove to keep up the grandeur of that idea which homer had impressed upon their imagination as we read of phidias concerning the statue of jupiter and because they copied their gods from him in their best performances his descriptions became the characters which were afterward pursued in all works of a good taste hence came the common saying of the ancients that either homer was the only man who had seen the forms of the gods or the only one who had shown them to men a passage which dacier preface to homer madam dacier wrests to prove the truth of his theology different from strabos acceptance of it  there are besides what we have spoken of other sciences pretended to be found in him thus macrobius discovers that the chain with which il      vid macrob de somn scip l   c    jupiter says he could lift the world is a metaphysical notion that means a connection of all things from the supreme being to the meanest part of the creation others to prove him skilful in judicial astrology bring a quotation concerning the births of il        hector and polydamas on the same night who were nevertheless of different qualifications one excelling in war and the other in eloquence others again will have him to be versed in magic from his stories concerning ciree these and many of the like nature are interpretations strained or trifling such as homer does not want for a proof of his learning and by which we contribute nothing to raise his character while we sacrifice our judgment to him in the eyes of others  it is sufficient to have gone thus far in showing he was a father of learning a soul capable of ranging over the whole creation with an intellectual view shining alone in an age of obscurity and shining beyond those who have had the opportunity of more learned ages leaving behind him a work adorned with the knowledge of his own time and in which he has beforehand broken up the fountains of several sciences which were brought nearer to perfection by posterity a work which shall always stand at the top of the sublime character to be gazed at by readers with an admiration of its perfection and by writers with a despair that it should ever be emulated with

of the delegates of jove from whom the power of laws and justice springs tremendous oath inviolate to kings by this i swear when bleeding greece again shall call achilles she shall call in vain when flushed with slaughter hector comes to spread the purpled shore with mountains of the dead then shall thou mourn the affront thy madness gave forced to deplore when impotent to save then rage in bitterness of soul to know this act has made the bravest greek thy foe he spoke and furious hurled against the ground his scepter starrd with golden studs around then sternly silent sat with like disdain the raging king returned his frowns again to calm their passion with the words of age slow from his seat arose the pylian sage the experienced nestor in persuasion skilled words sweet as honey from his lips distilled two generations now had past away wise by his rules and happy by his sway two ages over his native realm he reigned and now the example of the third remained all viewed with awe the venerable man who thus with mild benevolence began what shame what woe is this to greece what joy to troys proud monarch and the friends of troy that adverse gods commit to stern debate the best the bravest of the grecian state young as you are this youthful heat restrain nor think your nestors years and wisdom vain a godlike race of heroes once i knew such as no more these aged eyes shall view lives there a chief to match pirithous fame dryas the bold or ceneus deathless name theseus endud with more than mortal might or polyphemus like the gods in fight with these of old to toils of battle bred in early youth my hardy days i led fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds and smit with love of honorable deeds strongest of men they pierced the mountain boar ranged the wild deserts red with monsters gore and from their hills the shaggy centaurs tore yet these with soft persuasive arts i swayed when nestor spoke they listened and obeyed if in my youth even these esteemed me wise do you young warriors hear my age advise atrides seize not on the beauteous slave that prize the greeks by common suffrage gave nor thou achilles treat our prince with pride let kings be just and sovereign power preside thee the first honors of the war adorn like gods in strength and of a goddess born him awful majesty exalts above the powers of earth and sceptred sons of jove let both unite with wellconsenting mind so shall authority with strength be joined leave me o king to calm achilles rage rule thou thy self as more advanced in age forbid it gods achilles should be lost the pride of greece and bulwark of our host this said he ceased the king of men replies thy years are awful and thy words are wise but that imperious that unconquered soul no laws can limit no respect control before his pride must his superiors fall his word the law and he the lord of all him must our hosts our chiefs our self obey what king can bear a rival in his sway grant that the gods his matchless force have given has foul reproach a privilege from heaven here on the monarchs speech achilles broke and furious thus and interrupting spoke tyrant i well deserved thy galling chain to live thy slave and still to serve in vain should i submit to each unjust decree command thy vassals but command not me seize on briseis whom the grecians doomed my prize of war yet tamely see resumed and seize secure no more achilles draws his conquering sword in any womans cause the gods command me to forgive the past but let this first invasion be the last for know thy blood when next thou dare invade shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade at this they ceased the stern debate expired the chiefs in sullen majesty retired achilles with patroclus took his way where near his tents his hollow vessels lay mean time atrides launched with numerous oars a wellriggd ship for chrysas sacred shores high on the deck was fair chruseis placed and sage ulysses with the conduct graced safe in her sides the hecatomb they stowed then swiftly sailing cut the liquid road the host to expiate next the king prepares with pure lustrations and with solemn prayers washed by the briny wave the pious

she in soft sorrows and in pensive thought supported by the chiefs on either hand in silence past along the winding strand not so his loss the fierce achilles bore but sad retiring to the sounding

sire his gods peculiar care to phoebus prayed and phoebus heard the prayer a dreadful plague ensues the avenging darts incessant fly and pierce the grecian hearts a prophet then inspired by heaven arose and points the crime and thence derives the woes my self the first the assembled chiefs incline tavert the vengeance of the power divine then rising in his wrath the monarch stormed incensed he threatened and his threats performed the fair chruseis to her sire was sent with offered gifts to make the god relent but now he seized briseis heavenly charms and of my valors prize defrauds my arms defrauds the votes of all the grecian train and service faith and justice plead in vain but goddess thou thy suppliant son attend to high olympus shining court ascend urge all the ties to former

this to his remembrance call embrace his knees at his tribunal fall conjure him far to drive the grecian train to hurl them headlong to their fleet and main to heap the shores with copious death and bring the greeks to know the curse of such a king let agamemnon lift his haughty head over all his wide dominion of the dead and mourn in blood that ever he durst disgrace the boldest warrior of the grecian race unhappy son fair thetis thus replies while tears celestial trickled from her eyes why have i born thee with a mothers throes to fates averse and nursed for future woes so short a space the light of heaven to view so short a space and filled with sorrow too oh might a parents careful wish prevail far far from ilion should thy vessels sail and thou from camps remote the danger shun which now alas too nearly threats my son yet what i can to move thy suit i will go to great olympus crowned with fleecy snow mean time secure within thy ships from far behold the field nor mingle in the war the sire of gods and all the etherial train on the warm limits of the farthest main now mix with mortals nor disdain to grace the feasts of aethiopias blameless race twelve days the powers indulge the genial rite returning with the twelfth revolving light then will i mount the brazen dome and move the high tribunal of immortal jove the goddess spoke the rolling waves unclose then down the deep she plunged from whence she rose and left him sorrowing on the lonely coast in wild resentment for the fair he lost in chrysas port now sage ulysses rode beneath the deck the destined victims stowed the sails they furled they lashed the mast aside and dropped their anchors and the pinnace tied next on the shore their hecatomb they land chruseis last descending on the strand her thus returning from the furrowed main ulysses led to phoebus sacred fane where at his solemn altar as the maid he gave to chryses thus the hero said hail reverend priest to phoebus awful dome a suppliant i from great atrides come unransomd here receive the spotless fair accept the hecatomb the greeks prepare and may thy god who scatters darts around atoned by sacrifice desist to wound at this the sire embraced the maid again so sadly lost so lately sought in vain then near the altar of the darting king disposed in rank their hecatomb they bring with water purify their hands and take the sacred offering of the salted cake while thus with arms devoutly raised in air and solemn voice the priest directs his prayer god of the silver bow thy ear incline whose power encircles cilla the divine whose sacred eye thy tenedos surveys and gilds fair chrysa with distinguished rays if fired to vengeance at thy priests request thy direful darts inflict the raging pest once more attend avert the wastful woe and smile propitious and unbend thy bow so chryses prayed apollo heard his prayer and now the greeks their hecatomb prepare between their horns the salted barley threw and with their heads to heaven the victims slew the limbs they sever from the enclosing hide the thighs selected to the gods divide on these in double cawls involved with art the choicest morsels lay from every part the priest himself before his altar stands and burns the victims with his holy hands pours the black wine and sees the flames aspire the youth with instruments surround the fire the thighs thus sacrificed

jove first ascending from the watery bowers leads the long order of aetherial powers when like a morning mist in early day rose from the flood the daughter of the sea and to the seats divine her flight addressed there far apart and high above the rest the thundrer sat where old olympus shrouds his hundred heads in heaven and props the clouds suppliant the goddess stood one hand she placed beneath his beard and one his knees embraced if ever o father of the gods she said my words could please thee or my actions aid some marks of honor on my son bestow and pay in glory what in life you

starry domes the gods depart the shining monuments of vulcans art jove on his couch reclined his awful head and juno slumberd on the golden bed observations on the first book observations on the first book it is something strange that of all the commentators upon homer there is hardly one whose principal design is to illustrate the poetical beauties of the author they are voluminous in explaining those sciences which he made but subservient to his poetry and sparing only upon that art which constitutes his character this has been occasioned by the ostentation of men who had more reading than taste and were fonder of showing their variety of learning in all kinds than their single understanding in poetry hence it comes to pass that their remarks are rather philosophical historical geographical allegorical or in short rather any thing than critical and poetical even the grammarians though their whole business and use be only to render the words of an author intelligible are strangely touched with the pride of doing something more than they ought the grand ambition of one sort of scholars is to increase the number of various lections which they have done to such a degree of obscure diligence that we now begin to value the first editions of books as most correct because they have been least corrected the prevailing passion of others is to discover new meanings in an author whom they will cause to appear mysterious purely for the vanity of being thought to unravel him these account it a disgrace to be of the opinion of those that preceded them and it is generally the fate of such people who will never say what was said before to say what will never be said after them if they can but find a word that has once been strained by some dark writer to signify any thing different from its usual acceptance it is frequent with them to apply to constantly to that uncommon meaning whenever they meet it in a clear writer for reading is so much dearer to them than sense that they will discard it at any time to make way for a criticism in other places where they cannot contest the truth of the common interpretation they get themselves room for dissertation by imaginary amphibologies which they will have to be designed by the author this disposition of finding out different significations in one thing may be the effect of either too much or too little wit for men of a right understanding generally see at once all that an author can reasonably mean but others are apt to fancy two meanings for want of knowing one not to add that there is a vast deal of difference between the learning of a critic and the puzzling of a grammarian  it is no easy task to make something out of a hundred pedants that is not pedantical yet this he must do who would give a tolerable abstract of the former expositors of homer the commentaries of eustathius are indeed an immense treasury of the greek learning but as he seems to have amassed the substance of whatever others had written upon the author so he is not free from some of the foregoing censures there are those who have said that a judicious abstract of him alone might furnish out sufficient illustrations upon homer it was resolved to take the trouble of reading through that voluminous work and the reader may be assured those remarks that any way concern the poetry or art of the poet are much fewer than is imagined the greater part of these is already plundered by succeeding commentators who have very little but what they owe to him and i am obliged to say even of madam dacier that she is either more beholden to him than she has confessed or has read him less than she is willing to own she has made a farther attempt than her predecessors to discover the beauties of the poet though we have often only her general praises and exclamations instead of reasons but her remarks all together are the most judicious collection extant of the scattered observations of the ancients and moderns as her preface is excellent and her translation equally careful and elegant  the chief design of the following notes is to comment upon homer as a poet whatever in them is extracted from others is constantly owned the remarks of the ancients are generally set at length and the places cited all those of eustathius are collected which fall under this scheme many which were not acknowledged by other commentators are restored to the true owner and the same justice is shown to those who refused it to others  i the plan of this poem is formed upon anger and its ill effects the plan of virgils upon pious resignation and its rewards and thus every passion or virtue may be the foundation of the scheme of an epic poem this distinction between two authors who have been so successful seemed necessary to be taken notice of that they who would imitate either may not stumble at the very entrance or curb their imaginations so as to deprive us of noble morals told in a new variety of accidents imitation does not hinder invention we may observe the rules of nature and write in the spirit of those who have best hit upon them without taking the same track beginning in the same manner and following the main of their story almost step by step as most of the modern writers of epic poetry have done after one of these great poets  ii verse   quintilian has told us that from the beginning of homers two poems the rules of all exordiums were derived  in paucissimis versibus utriusque operis ingressu legem prooemiorum non dico servavit sed constituit yet rapin has been very free with this invocation in his comparison between homer and virgil which is by no means the most judicious of his works he cavils first at the poets insisting so much upon the effects of achilless anger that it was the cause of the woes of the greeks that it sent so many heroes to the shades that their bodies were left a prey to birds and beasts the first of which he thinks had been sufficient one may answer that the woes of greece might consist in several other things than in the death of her heroes which was therefore needful to be specified as to the bodies he might have reflected how great a curse the want of burial was accounted by the ancients and how prejudicial it was esteemed even to the souls of the deceased we have a most particular example of the strength of this opinion from the conduct of sophocles in his ajax who thought this very point sufficient to make the distress of the last act of that tragedy after the death of his hero purely to satisfy the audience that he obtained the rites of sepulture next he objects it as preposterous in homer to desire the muse to tell him the whole story and at the same time to inform her solemnly in his own person that twas the will of jove which brought it about but is a poet then to be imagined entirely ignorant of his subject though he invokes the muse to relate the particulars may not homer be allowed the knowledge of so plain a truth as that the will of god is fulfilled in all things nor does his manner of saying this infer that he informs the muse of it but only corresponds with the usual way of desiring information from another concerning any thing and at the same time mentioning that little we know of it in general what is there more in this passage sing o goddess that wrath of achilles which proved so pernicious to the greeks we only know the effects of it that it sent innumerable brave men to the shades and that it was joves will it should be so but tell me o muse what was the source of this destructive anger i cannot apprehend what rapin means by saying it is hard to know where this invocation ends and that it is confounded with the narration which so manifestly begins at  but upon the whole methinks the french critics play double with us when they sometimes represent the rules of poetry to be formed upon the practice of homer and at other times arraign their master as if he transgressed them horace has said the exordium of an epic poem ought to be plain and modest and instances homers as such and rapin from this very rule will be trying homer and judging it otherwise for he criticizes also upon the beginning of the odysses but for a full answer we may bring the words of quintilian whom rapin himself allows to be the best of critics concerning these propositions and invocations of our author  benevolum auditorem invocatione dearum quas praesidere vatibus creditum est intentum proposita rerum magnitudine and docilem summa celeriter comprehensa facit  iii verse    plutarch observes there is a defect in the measure of this first line i suppose he means in the etas of the patronymick this he thinks the fiery vein of homer making haste to his subject past over with a bold neglect being conscious of his own power and perfection in the greater parts as some says he who make virtue their sole aim pass by censure in smaller matters but perhaps we may find no occasion to suppose this a neglect in him if we consider that the word pelides had he made use of it without so many alterations as he has put it to in  would still have been true to the rules of measure make but a diphthong of the second eta and the iota instead of their being two syllables perhaps by the fault of transcribers and the objection is gone or perhaps it might be designed that the verse in which he professes to sing of violent anger should run off in the rapidity of dactyles this art he is allowed to have used in other places and virgil has been particularly celebrated for it  iv verse   will of jove plutarch in his treatise of reading poets interprets  in this place to signify fate not imagining it consistent with the goodness of the supreme being or jupiter to contrive or practice any evil against men eustathius makes  will here to refer to the promise which jupiter gave to thetis that he would honor her son by siding with troy while he should be absent but to reconcile these two opinions perhaps the meaning may be that when fate had decreed the destruction of troy jupiter having the power of incidents to bring it to pass fulfilled that decree by providing means for it so that the words may thus specify the time of action from the beginning of the poem in which those incidents worked till the promise to thetis was fulfilled and the destruction of troy ascertained to the greeks by the death of hector however it is certain that this poet was not an absolute fatalist but still supposed the power of jove superior for in the sixteenth iliad we see him designing to save sarpedon though the fates had decreed his death if juno had not interposed neither does he exclude free will in men for as he attributes the destruction of the heroes to the will of jove in the beginning of the iliad so he attributes the destruction of ulyssess friends to their own folly in the beginning of the odysses    v verse   declare o muse it may be questioned whether the first period ends at  and the interrogation to the muse begins with   or whether the period does not end till the words  with only a single interrogation at   i should be inclined to favor the former and think it a double interrogative as milton seems to have done in his imitation of this place at the beginning of paradise lost  say first what cause moved our grand parents etc and just after who first seduced them to that foul revolt besides that i think the proposition concludes more nobly with the sentence such was the will of jove but the latter being followed by most editions and by all the translations i have seen in any language the general acceptance is here complied with only transposing the line to keep the sentence last and the next verses are so turned as to include the double interrogation and at the same time do justice to another interpretation of the words  ex quo tempore which marks the date of the quarrel from whence the poem takes its rise chapman would have ex quo understood of jupiter from whom the debate was suggested but this clashes with the line immediately following where he asks what god inspired the contention and answers it was apollo  vi verse    latona s son here the author who first invoked the muse as the goddess of memory vanishes from the readers view and leaves her to relate the whole affair through the poem whose presence from this time diffuses an air of majesty over the relation and lest this should be lost to our thoughts by the continuation of the story he sometimes refreshes them with a new invocation at proper intervals eustathius  vii verse  0 the scepter and the laurel crown there is something exceedingly venerable in this appearance of the priest to command attention he comes with the ensigns of the god he belonged to the laurel crown now carried in his hand to show he was a suppliant and a golden scepter which the ancients gave in particular to apollo as they did a silver one to the moon and other sorts to other planets eustathius  viii verse    ye kings and warriors the art of this speech is remarkable chryses considers the constitution of the greeks before troy as made up of troops partly from kingdoms and partly from democracies wherefore he begins with a distinction which comprehends all after this as apollos priest he prays that they may obtain the two blessings they had most in view the conquest of troy and a safe return then as he names his petition he offers an extraordinary ransom and concludes with bidding them fear the god if they refuse it like one who from his office seems to foresee their misery and exhorts them to shun it thus he endeavors to work by the art of a general application by religion by interest and the insinuation of danger this is the substance of what eustathius remarks on this place and in pursuance to his last observation the epithet avenging is added to this version that it may appear the priest foretells the anger of his god  ix verse    he with pride repulsed it has been remarked in honor of homers judgment and the care he took of his readers morals that where he speaks of evil actions committed or hard words given he generally characterises them as such by a previous expression this passage is given as one instance of it where he says the repulse of chryses was a proud injurious action in agamemnon and it may be remarked that before his heroes fall on one another with hard language in this book he still takes care to let us know they were under a distraction of anger plutarch of reading poets  x verse    till time shall rifle every youthful grace and age dismiss her from my cold embrace in daily labors of the loom employed or doomed to deck the bed she once enjoyed the greek is  which signifies either making the bed or partaking it eustathius and madam dacier insist very much upon its being taken in the former sense only for fear of presenting a loose idea to the reader and of offending against the modesty of the muse who is supposed to relate the poem this observation may very well become a bishop and a lady but that agamemnon was not studying here for civility of expression appears from the whole tenor of his speech and that he designed chryseis for more than a servantmaid may be seen from some other things he says of her as that he preferred her to his queen clytemnestra etc the impudence of which confession madam dacier herself has elsewhere animadverted upon mr dryden in his translation of this book has been juster to the royal passion of agamemnon though he has carried the point so much on the other side as to make him promise a greater fondness for her in her old age than in her youth which indeed is hardly credible mine she shall be till creeping age and time her bloom have withered and destroyed her prime till then my nuptial bed she shall attend and having first adorned it late ascend this for the night by day the web and loom and homely housholdtasks shall be her doom nothing could have made mr dryden capable of this mistake but extreme haste in writing which never ought to be imputed as a fault to him but to those who suffered so noble a genius to lie under the necessity of it  xi verse    the trembling priest we may take notice here once for all that homer is frequently eloquent in his very silence chryses says not a word in answer to the insults of agamemnon but walks pensive along the shore and the melancholy flowing of the verse admirably expresses the condition of the mournful and deserted father    xii verse    the favoring god attends upon this first prayer in the poem eustathius takes occasion to observe that the poet is careful throughout his whole work to let no prayer ever fall entirely which has justice on its side but he who prays either kills his enemy or has signs given him that he has been heard or his friends return or his undertaking succeeds or some other visible good happens so far instructive and useful to life has homer made his fable  xiii verse    he bent his deadly bow in the tenth year of the siege of troy a plague happened in the grecian camp occasioned perhaps by immoderate heats and gross exhalations at the introduction of this accident homer begins his poem and takes occasion from it to open the scene of action with a most beautiful allegory he supposes that such afflictions are sent from heaven for the punishment of our evil actions and because the sun whom the heathens worshipped was a principal instrument of it he says it was sent to punish agamemnon for despising that god and injuring his priest eustathius  xiv verse    mules and dogs hippocrates observes two things of plagues that their cause is in the air and that different animals are differently touched by them according to their nature or nourishment this philosophy spondanus refers to the plague here mentioned first the cause is in the air by reason of the darts or beams of apollo secondly the mules and dogs are said to die sooner than the men partly because they have by nature a quickness of smell which makes the infection sooner perceivable and partly by the nourishment they take their feeding on the earth with prone heads making the exhalation the more easy to be sucked in with it thus has hippocrates so long after homer writ subscribed to his knowledge in the rise and progress of this distemper there have been some who have referred this passage to a religious sense making the death of the mules and dogs before the men to point out a kind method of providence in punishing whereby it sends some previous afflictions to warn mankind so as to make them shun the greater evils by repentance this monsieur dacier in his notes on aristotless art of poetry calls a remark perfectly fine and agreeable to gods method of sending plagues on the egyptians where first horses asses etc were smitten and afterward the men themselves  xv verse    thetis godlike son convenes a council on the tenth day a council is held to enquire why the gods were angry we may observe with plutarch how justly he applies the characters of his persons to the incidents not making agamemnon but achilles call this council who of all the kings was most capable of making observations upon the plague and of foreseeing its duration as having been bred by chiron to the study of physic one may mention also a remark of eustathius in pursuance to this that junos advising him in this case might allude to his knowledge of an evil temperament in the air of which she was goddess  xvi verse    why leave we not the fatal trojan shore etc the artifice of this speech according to dionysius of halicarnassus in his second discourse  is admirably carried on to open an accusation against agamemnon whom achilles suspects to be the cause of all their miseries he directs himself not to the assembly but to agamemnon he names not only the plague but the war too as having exhausted them all which was evidently due to his family he leads the augurs he would consult by pointing at something lately done with respect to apollo and while he continues within the guard of civil expression scattering his insinuations he encourages those who may have more knowledge to speak out boldly by letting them see there is a party made for their safety which has its effect immediately in the following speech of chalcas whose demand of protection shows upon whom the offense is to be placed  xvii verse    by mystic dreams it does not seem that by the word  an interpreter of dreams is meant for we have no hint of any preceding dream which wants to be interpreted we may therefore more probably refer it to such who used after performing proper rites to lie down at some sacred place and expect a dream from the gods upon any particular subject which they desired that this was a practice amongst them appears from the temples of amphiaraus in boeotia and podalirius in apulia where the enquirer was obliged to sleep at the altar upon the skin of the beast he had sacrificed in order to obtain an answer it is in this manner that latinus in virgils seventh book goes to dream in the temple of faunus where we have a particular description of the whole custom strabo lib    has spoken concerning the temple of jerusalem as a place of this nature where says he the people either dreamed for themselves or procured some good dreamer to do it by which it should seem he had read something concerning the visions of their prophets as that which samuel had when he was ordered to sleep a third time before the ark and upon doing so had an account of the destruction of elis house or that which happened to solomon after having sacrificed before the ark at gibeon the same author also has mentioned the temple of serapis in his seventeenth book as a place for receiving oracles by dreams  xviii verse    beloved of jove achilles these appellations of praise and honor with which the heroes in homer so frequently salute each other were agreeable to the style of the ancient times as appears from several of the like nature in the scripture milton has not been wanting to give his poem this cast of antiquity throughout which our first parents almost always accost each other with some title that expresses a respect to the dignity of human nature daughter of god and man immortal eve adam earths hallowed mould of god inspired offspring of heaven and earth and all earths lord etc   xix verse     not even the chief after achilles had brought in chalcas by his dark doubts concerning agamemnon chalcas who perceived them and was unwilling to be the first that named the king artfully demands a protection in such a manner as confirms those doubts and extorts from him that warm and particular expression that he would protect him even against agamemnon who as he says is now the greatest man of greece to hint that at the expiration of the war he should be again reduced to be barely king of mycenae this place plutarch takes notice of as the first in which achilles shows his contempt of sovereign authority  xx verse     the blameless priest the epithet  or blameless is frequent in homer but not always used with so much propriety as here the reader may observe that care has not been wanting through this translation to preserve those epithets which are peculiar to the author whenever they receive any beauty from the circumstances about them as this of blameless manifestly does in the present passage it is not only applied to a priest but to one who being conscious of the truth prepares with an honest boldness to discover it  xxi verse     augur accursed this expression is not merely thrown out by chance but proves what chalcas said of the king when he asked protection that he harbored anger in his heart for it aims at the prediction chalcas had given at aulis nine years before for the sacrificing his daughter iphigenia spondanus  this and the two following lines are in a manner repetitions of the same thing thrice over it is left to the reader to consider how far it may be allowed or rather praised for a beauty when we consider with eustathius that it is a most natural effect of anger to be full of words and insisting on that which galls us we may add that these reiterated expressions might be supposed to be thrown out one after another according as agamemnon is struck in the confusion of his passion first by the remembrance of one prophecy and then of another which the same man had uttered against him  xxii verse     not half so dear were clytemnestra s charms agamemnon having heard the charge which chalcas drew up against him in two particulars that he had affronted the priest and refused to restore his daughter he offers one answer which gives softening colors to both that he loved her as well as his queen clytemnestra for her perfections thus he would seem to satisfy the father by kindness to his daughter to excuse himself before the greeks for what is past and to make a merit of yielding her in the following lines and sacrificing his passion for their safety  xxiii verse     insatiate king here where this passion of anger grows loud it seems proper to prepare the reader and prevent his mistake in the character of achilles which might shock him in several particulars following we should know that the poet has rather studied nature than perfection in the laying down his characters he resolved to sing the consequences of anger he considered what virtues and vices would conduce most to bring his moral out of the fable and artfully disposed them in his chief persons after the manner in which we generally find them making the fault which most peculiarly attends any good quality to reside with it thus he has placed pride with magnanimity in agamemnon and craft with prudence in ulysses and thus we must take his achilles not as a mere heroic dispassiond character but as one compounded of courage and anger one who finds himself almost invincible and assumes an uncontrolled carriage upon the selfconsciousness of his worth whose high strain of honor will not suffer him to betray his friends or fight against them even when he thinks they have affronted him but whose inexorable resentment will not let him hearken to any terms of accommodation these are the lights and shades of his character which homer has heightened and darkened in extremes because on the one side valor is the darling quality of epic poetry and on the other anger the particular subject of his poem when characters thus mixed are well conducted though they be not morally beautiful quite through they conduce more to the end and are still poetically perfect  plutarch takes occasion from the observation of this conduct in homer to applaud his just imitation of nature and truth in representing virtues and vices intermixed in his heroes contrary to the paradoxes and strange positions of the stoics who held that no vice could consist with virtue nor the least virtue with vice plut de and poetis  xxiv verse     great as thou art and like a god in fight the words in the original are  ulysses is soon after called  and others in other places the phrase of divine or godlike is not used by the poet to signify perfection in men but applied to considerable persons upon account of some particular qualification or advantage which they were possessed of far above the common standard of mankind thus it is ascribed to achilles upon account of his great valor to ulysses for his preeminence in wisdom even to paris for his exceeding beauty and to clytemnestra for several fair endowments  xxv verse     first let the just equivalent the reasoning in point of right between achilles and agamemnon seems to be this achilles pleads that agamemnon could not seize upon any other mans captive without a new distribution it being an invasion of private property on the other hand as agamemnons power was limited how came it that all the grecian captains would submit to an illegal and arbitrary action i think the legal pretense for his seizing briseis must have been founded upon that law whereby the commander in chief had the power of taking what part of the prey he pleased for his own use and he being obliged to restore what he had taken it seemed but just that he should have a second choice  xxvi verse     and dare thou threat to snatch my prize away due to the deeds of many a dreadful day the anger of these two princes was equally upon the account of women but yet it is observable that there is a different air with which they are conducted agamemnon appears as a lover achilles as a warrior the one speaks of chryseis as a beauty whom he valued equal to his wife and whose merit was too considerable to be easily resigned the other treats briseis as a slave whom he is concerned to preserve in point of honor and as a testimony of his glory hence it is that we never hear him mention her but as his spoil the reward of war the gift the graecians gave him or the like expressions and accordingly he yields her up not in grief for a mistress whom he loses but in sullenness for an injury that is done him this observation is madam daciers and will often appear just as we proceed farther nothing is finer than the moral exhibited to us in this quarrel of the blindness and partiality of mankind to their own faults the graecians make a war to recover a woman that was ravished and are in danger to fail in the attempt by a dispute about another agamemnon while he is revenging a rape commits one and achilles while he is in the utmost fury himself reproaches agamemnon for his passionate temper  xxvii verse     fly mighty warrior achilles having threatened to leave them in the former speech and spoken of his acts of war the poet here puts an artful piece of spite in the mouth of agamemnon making him opprobriously brand his retreat as a flight and lessen the appearance of his courage by calling it the love of contention and slaughter  xxviii verse     kings the gods distinguished care in the original it is  or nursed by jove homer often uses to call his kings by such epithets as  born of the gods or  bred by the gods by which he points out to themselves the offices they were ordained for and to their people the reverence that should be paid them these expressions of his are perfectly in the exalted style of the eastern nations and correspondent to those places of holy scripture where they are called gods and the sons of the most high  xxix verse     minerva swift descended from above homer having by degrees raised achilles to such a pitch of fury as to make him capable of attempting agamemnons life in the council pallas the goddess of wisdom descends and being seen only by him pulls him back in the very instant of execution he parlies with her a while as imagining she would advise him to proceed but upon the promise of a time wherein there should be a full reparation of his honor he sheaths his sword in obedience to her she ascends to heaven and he being left to himself falls again upon his general with bitter expressions the allegory here may be allowed by every reader to be unforced the prudence of achilles checks him in the rashest moment of his anger it works upon him unseen to others but does not entirely prevail upon him to desist till he remembers his own importance and depends upon it that there will be a necessity of their courting him at any expense into the alliance again having persuaded himself by such reflections he forbears to attack his general but thinking that he sacrifices enough to prudence by this forbearance lets the thought of it vanish from him and no sooner is wisdom gone but he falls into more violent reproaches for the gratification of his passion all this is a most beautiful passage whose moral is evident and generally agreed upon by the commentators  xxx verse     known by the flames that sparkled from her eyes they who carry on this allegory after the most minute manner refer this to the eyes of achilles as indeed we must if we entirely destroy the bodily appearance of minerva but what poet designing to have his moral so open would take pains to form it into a fable in the proper mythological sense this passage should be referred to minerva according to an opinion of the ancients who supposed that the gods had a peculiar light in their eyes that homer was not ignorant of this opinion appears from his use of it in other places as when in the third iliad helena by this means discovers venus and that he meant it here is particularly asserted by heliodorus in the third book of his aethiopick history the gods says he are known in their apparitions to men by the fixed glare of their eyes or their gliding passage through air without moving the feet these marks homer has used from his knowledge of the egyptian learning applying one to pallas and the other to neptune madam dacier has gone into the contrary opinion and blames eustathius and others without overthrowing these authorities or assigning any other reason but that it was not proper for minervas eyes to sparkle when her speech was mild  xxxi verse     thou dog in forehead it has been one of the objections against the manners of homers heroes that they are abusive mons de la motte affirms in his discourse upon the iliad that great men differ from the vulgar in their manner of expressing their passion but certainly in violent passions such as those of achilles and agamemnon the great are as subject as any others to these sallies of which we have frequent examples both from history and experience plutarch taking notice of this line gives it as a particular commendation of homer that he constantly affords us a fine lecture of morality in his reprehensions and praises by referring them not to the goods of fortune or the body but those of the mind which are in our power and for which we are blameable or praiseworthy thus says he agamemnon is reproached for impudence and fear ajax for vainbragging idomeneus for the love of contention and ulysses does not reprove even thersites but as a babbler though he had so many personal deformities to object to him in like manner also the appellations and epithets with which they accost one another are generally founded on some distinguishing qualification of merit as wise ulysses hector equal to jove in wisdom achilles chief glory of the greeks and the like plutarch of reading poets  xxxii verse     in ambushd fights to dare homer has magnified the ambush as the boldest manner of fight they went upon those parties with a few men only and generally the most daring of the army on occasions of the greatest hazard where they were therefore more exposed than in a regular battle thus idomeneus in the thirteenth book expressly tells meriones that the greatest courage appears in this way of service each man being in a manner singled out to the proof of it eustathius  xxxiii verse  0  now by this sacred scepter spondanus in this place blames eustathius for saying that homer makes achilles in his passion swear by the first thing he meets with and then assigns as from himself two causes which the other had mentioned so plainly before that it is a wonder they could be overlooked the substance of the whole passage in eustathius is that if we consider the scepter simply as wood achilles after the manner of the ancients takes in his transport the first thing to swear by but that homer himself has in the process of the description assigned reasons why it is proper for the occasion which may be seen by considering it symbolically first that as the wood being cut from the tree will never reunite and flourish so neither should their amity ever flourish again after they were divided by this contention secondly that a scepter being the mark of power and symbol of justice to swear by it might in effect be construed swearing by the god of power and by justice itself and accordingly it is spoken of by aristotle   l polit as a usual solemn oath of kings  i cannot leave this passage without showing in opposition to some moderns who have criticizd upon it as tedious that it has been esteemed a beauty of so fine a nature by the ancients as to engage them in its imitation virgil has almost transcribed it in his    aen for the scepter of latinus ut sceptrum hoc sceptrum dextra nam forte gerebat nunquam fronde levi sundet virgulta nec umbras cum semel in silvis imo de stirpe recisum matre caret posuitque comas and brachia ferro olim arbos nunc artificis manus aere decoro inclusit patribusque dedit gestare latinis but i cannot think this comes up to the spirit or propriety of homer notwithstanding the judgment of scaliger who decides for virgil upon a trivial comparison of the wording in each l   cap   poet it fails in a greater point than any he has mentioned which is that being there used on occasion of a peace it has no emblematical reference to division and yet describes the cutting of the wood and its incapacity to bloom and branch again in as many words as homer it is borrowed by valerius flaccus in his third book where he makes jason swear as a warrior by his spear hanc ego magnanimi spolium didymaonis hastam ut semel est avulsa jugis a matre perempta quae neque jam frondes virides neque proferet umbras fida ministeria and duras obit horrida pugnas testor    and indeed however he may here borrow some expressions from virgil or fall below him in others he has nevertheless kept to homer in the emblem by introducing the oath upon jasons grief for sailing to colchis without hercules when he had separated himself from the body of the argonauts to search after hylas to render the beauty of this passage more manifest the allusion is inserted but with the fewest words possible in this translation  xxxiv verse     thy rashness made the bravest greek thy foe though selfpraise had not been agreeable to the haughty nature of achilles yet plutarch has mentioned a case and with respect to him wherein it is allowable he says that achilles has at other times ascribed his success to jupiter but it is permitted to a man of merit and figure who is injuriously dealt with to speak frankly of himself to those who are forgetful and unthankful  xxxv verse     two generations the commentators make not nestor to have lived three hundred years according to ovids opinion they take the word  not to signify a century or age of the world but a generation or compass of time in which one set of men flourish which in the common computation is thirty years and accordingly it is here translated as much the more probable  from what nestor says in this speech madam dacier computes the age he was of at the end of the trojan war the fight of the lapithae and centaurs fell out fifty five or sixty years before the war of troy the quarrel of agamemnon and achilles happened in the tenth and last year of that war it was then fifty five or sixty five years since nestor fought against the centaurs he was capable at that time of giving counsel so that one cannot imagine him to have been under twenty from whence it will appear that he was now almost arrived to the conclusion of his third age and about fourscore and five or fourscore and six years of age  xxxvi verse     what shame the quarrel having risen to its highest extravagance nestor the wisest and most aged greek is raised to quiet the princes whose speech is therefore framed entirely with an opposite air to all which has been hitherto said sedate and inoffensive he begins with a soft affectionate complaint which he opposes to their threats and haughty language he reconciles their attention in an awful manner by putting them in mind that they hear one whom their fathers and the greatest heroes have heard with deference he sides with neither that he might not anger any one while he advises them to the proper methods of reconciliation and he appears to side with both while he praises each that they may be induced by the recollection of one anothers worth to return to that amity which would bring success to the cause it was not however consistent with the plan of the poem that this should entirely appease them for then the anger would be at an end which was proposed to be sung through the whole homer has not therefore made this speech to have its full success and yet that the eloquence of his nestor might not be thrown out of character by its proving unavailable he takes care that the violence with which the dispute was managed should abate immediately upon his speaking agamemnon confesses that all he spoke was right achilles promises not to fight for briseis if she should be sent for and the council dissolves  it is to be observed that this character of authority and wisdom in nestor is every where admirably used by homer and made to exert itself through all the great emergencies of the poem as he quiets the princes here he proposes that expedient which reduces the army into their order after the sedition in the second book when the greeks are in the utmost distresses it is he who advises the building the fortification before the fleet which is the chief means of preserving them and it is by his persuasion that patroclus puts on the armor of achilles which occasions the return of that hero and the conquest of troy  xxxvii verse      no more achilles draws his conquering sword in any womans cause when achilles promises not to contest for briseis he expresses it in a sharp despising air i will not fight for the sake of a woman by which he glances at helena and casts an oblique reflection upon those commanders whom he is about to leave at the siege for her cause one may observe how well it is fancied of the poet to make one woman the ground of a quarrel which breaks an alliance that was only formed upon account of another and how much the circumstance thus considered contributes to keep up the anger of achilles for carrying on the poem beyond this dissolution of the council for as he himself argues with ulysses in the   th iliad it is as reasonable for him to retain his anger upon the account of briseis as for the brothers with all greece to carry on a war upon the score of helena i do not know that any commentator has taken notice of this sarcasm of achilles which i think a very obvious one  xxxviii verse     the ablutions all our former english translations seem to have erred in the sense of this line the word  being differently rendered by them offals or entrails or purgaments or ordures a gross set of ideas of which homer is not guilty the word comes from  eluo the same verb from whence  which precedes in the line is derived so that the sense appears to be as it is rendered here  they washed and threw away their washings perhaps this lustration might be used as a physical remedy in cleansing them from the infection of the plague as pausanias tells us it was by the arcadians from whence he says the plague was called  by the greeks  xxxix versee   0 at awful distance silent there was required a very remarkable management to preserve all the characters which are concerned in this nice conjuncture wherein the heralds were to obey at their peril agamemnon was to be gratified by an insult on achilles and achilles was to suffer so as might become his pride and not have his violent temper provoked from all this the poet has found the secret to extricate himself by only taking care to make his heralds stand in sight and silent thus they neither make agamemnons majesty suffer by uttering their message submissively nor occasion a rough treatment from achilles by demanding briseis in the peremptory air he ordered and at the same time achilles is gratified with the opportunity of giving her up as if he rather sent her than was forced to relinquish her the art of this has been taken notice of by eustathius  xl verse     she in soft sorrows the behavior of briseis in her departure is no less beautifully imagined than the former a french or italian poet had lavished all his wit and passion in two long speeches on this occasion which the heralds must have wept to hear instead of which homer gives us a fine picture of nature we see briseis passing unwillingly along with a dejected air melted in tenderness and not able to utter a word and in the lines immediately following we have a contraste to this in the gloomy resentment of achilles who suddenly retires to the shore and vents his rage aloud to the seas the variation of the numbers just in this place adds a great beauty to it which has been endeavored at in the translation  xli verse     there bathed in tears eustathius observes on this place that it is no weakness in heroes to weep but the very effect of humanity and proof of a generous temper for which he offers several instances and takes notice that if sophocles would not let ajax weep it is because he is drawn rather as a madman than a hero but this general observation is not all we can offer in excuse for the tears of achilles his are tears of anger and disdain as i have ventured to call them in the translation of which a great and fiery temper is more susceptible than any other and even in this case homer has taken care to preserve the high character by making him retire to vent his tears out of sight and we may add to these an observation of which madam dacier is fond which is the reason why agamemnon parts not in tears from chryseis and achilles should from briseis the one parts willingly from his mistress and because he does it for his peoples safety it becomes an honor to him the other is parted unwillingly and because his general takes her by force the action reflects a dishonor upon him  xlii verse     the thundrer owed this alludes to a story which achilles tells the ambassadors of agamemnon il   that he had the choice of two fates one less glorious at home but blessed with a very long life the other full of glory at troy but then he was never to return the alternative being thus proposed to him not from jupitcr but thetis who revealed the decree he chose the latter which he looks upon as his due since he gives away length of life for it and accordingly when he complains to his mother of the disgrace he lies under it is in this manner he makes a demand of honor  mons de la motte very judiciously observes that but for this foreknowledge of the certainty of his death at troy achilless character could have drawn but little esteem from the reader a hero of a vicious mind blessed only with a superiority of strength and invulnerable into the bargain was not very proper to excite admiration but homer by this exquisite piece of art has made him the greatest of heroes who is still pursuing glory in contempt of death and even under that certainty generously devoting himself in every action  xliii verse     from thebae homer who opened his poem with the action which immediately brought on achilless anger being now to give an account of the same thing again takes his rise more backward in the story thus the reader is informed in what he should know without having been delayed from entering upon the promised subject this is the first attempt which we see made toward the poetical method of narration which differs from the historical in that it does not proceed always directly in the line of time but sometimes relates things which have gone before when a more proper opportunity demands it to make the narration more informing or beautiful  the foregoing remark is in regard only to the first six lines of this speech what follows is a rehearsal of the preceding action of the poem almost in the same words he had used in the opening it and is one of those faults which has with most justice been objected to our author it is not to be denied but the account must be tedious of what the reader had been just before informed and especially when we are given to understand it was no way necessary by what achilles says at the beginning that thetis knew the whole story already as to repeating the same lines a practice usual with homer it is not so excusable in this place as in those where messages are delivered in the words they were received or the like it being unnatural to imagine that the person whom the poet introduces as actually speaking should fall into the selfsame words that are used in the narration by the poet himself yet milton was so great an admirer and imitator of our author as not to have scrupled even this kind of repetition the passage is at the end of his tenth book where adam having declared he would prostrate himself before god in certain particular acts of humiliation those acts are immediately after described by the poet in the same words  xliv verse     often have thou triumphed the persuasive which achilles is here made to put into the mouth of thetis is most artfully contrived to suit the present exigency you says he must entreat jupiter to bring miseries on the greeks who are protected by juno neptune and minerva put him therefore in mind that those deities were once his enemies and adjure him by that service you did him when those very powers would have bound him that he will now in his turn assist you against the endeavors they will certainly oppose to my wishes eustathius  as for the story itself some have thought with whom is madam dacier that there was some imperfect tradition of the fall of the angels for their rebellion which the greeks had received by commerce with egypt and thus they account the rebellion of the gods the precipitation of vulcan from heaven and joves threatening the inferior gods with tartarus in il   but as so many hints of scripture faintly imitated but it seems not improbable that the wars of the gods described by the poets allude to the confusion of the elements before they were brought into their natural order it is almost generally agreed that by jupiter is meant the ether and by juno the air the ancient philosophers supposed the ether to be igneous and by its kind influence upon the air to be the cause of all vegetation therefore homer says in the    th iliad     that upon jupiters embracing his wife the earth put forth its plants perhaps by thetiss assisting jupiter may be meant that the watery element subsiding and taking its natural place put an end to this combat of the elements  xlv verse     whom gods briareus men aegeon name this manner of making the gods speak a language different from men which is frequent in homer is a circumstance that as far as it widens the distinction between divine and human natures so far might tend to heighten the reverence paid the gods but besides this as the difference is thus told in poetry it is of use to the poets themselves for it appears like a kind of testimony of their inspiration or their converse with the gods and thereby gives a majesty to their works  xlvi verse     the sire of gods and all the etherial train on the warm limits of the farthest main now mix with mortals nor disdain to grace the feasts of aethiopia s blameless race the aethiopians says diodorus l   are said to be the inventors of pomps sacrifices solemn meetings and other honors paid to the gods from hence arose their character of piety which is here celebrated by homer among these there was an annual feast at diospolis which eustathius mentions wherein they carried about the statues of jupiter and the other gods for twelve days according to their number to which if we add the ancient custom of setting meat before statues it will appear a rite from which this fable might easily arise but it would be a great mistake to imagine from this place that homer represents the gods as eating and drinking upon earth a gross notion he was never guilty of as appears from these verses in the fifth book line   0    macrobius would have it that by jupiter here mentioned is meant the sun and that the number twelve hints at the twelve signs but whatever may be said in a critical defense of this opinion i believe the reader will be satisfied that homer considered as a poet would have his machinery understood upon that system of the gods which is properly grecian  one may take notice here that it were to be wished some passage were found in any authentic author that might tell us the time of the year when the aethiopians kept this festival at diospolis for from thence one might determine the precise season of the year wherein the actions of the iliad are represented to have happened and perhaps by that means farther explain the beauty and propriety of many passages in the poem  xlvii verse  00 the sacrifice if we consider this passage it is not made to shine in poetry all that can be done is to give it numbers and endeavor to set the particulars in a distinct view but if we take it in another light and as a piece of learning it is valuable for being the most exact account of the ancient sacrifices any where left us there is first the purification by washing of hands secondly the offering up of prayers thirdly the mola or barley cakes thrown upon the victim fourthly the manner of killing it with the head turned upwards to the celestial gods as they turned it downwards when they offered to the infernals fifthly their selecting the thighs and fat for their gods as the best of the sacrifice and the disposing about them pieces cut from every part for a representation of the whole hence the thighs or  are frequently used in homer and the greek poets for the whole victim sixthly the libation of wine seventhly consuming the thighs in the fire of the altar eighthly the sacrificers dressing and feasting on the rest with joy and hymns to the gods thus punctually have the ancient poets and in particular homer written with a care and respect to religion one may question whether any country as much a stranger to christianity as we are to heathenism might be so well informed by our poets in the worship belonging to any profession of religion at present  i am obliged to take notice how entirely mr dryden has mistaken the sense of this passage and the custom of antiquity for in his translation the cakes are thrown into the fire instead of being cast on the victim the sacrificers are made to eat the thighs and whatever belonged to the gods and no part of the victim is consumed for a burntoffering so that in effect there is no sacrifice at all some of the mistakes particularly that of turning the roastmeat on the spits which was not known in homers days he was led into by chapmans translation  xlviii verse     the faithful fixed irrevocable sign there are among men three things by which the efficacy of a promise may be made void the design not to perform it the want of power to bring it to pass and the instability of our tempers from all which homer saw that the divinity must be exempted and therefore he describes the nod or ratification of jupiters word as faithful in opposition to fraud sure of being performed in opposition to weakness and irrevocable in opposition to our repenting of a promise eustathius  xlix verse     he spoke and awful bends this description of the majesty of jupiter has something exceedingly grand and venerable macrobius reports that phidias having made his olympian jupiter which past for one of the greatest miracles of art he was asked from what pattern he framed so divine a figure and answered it was from that archetype which he found in these lines of homer the same author has also taken notice of virgils imitating it l  0 dixerat idque ratum stygii per flumina fratris per pice torrentes atraque voragine ripas annuit and totum nutu tremefecit olympum here indeed he has preserved the nod with its stupendous effect the making the heavens tremble but he has neglected the description of the eyebrows and the hair those chief pieces of imagery from whence the artist took the idea of a countenance proper for the king of gods and men  thus far macrobius whom scaliger answers in this manner aut ludunt phidiam aut nos ludit phidias etiam sine homero puto illum scisse jovem non carere superciliis and caesarie  l verse     jove assumes the throne as homer makes the first council of his men to be one continued scene of anger whereby the grecian chiefs became divided so he makes the first meeting of the gods to be spent in the same passion whereby jupiter is more fixed to assist the trojans and juno more incensed against them thus the design of the poem goes on the anger which began the book overspreads all existent beings by the latter end of it heaven and earth become engaged in the subject by which it rises to a great importance in the readers eyes and is hastened forward into the briskest scenes of action that can be framed upon that violent passion  li verse     say artful manager the gods and goddesses being described with all the desires and pleasures the passions and humors of mankind the commentators have taken a license from thence to draw not only moral observations but also satirical reflections out of this part of the poet these i am sorry to see fall so hard upon womankind and all by junos means sometimes she procures them a lesson for their curiosity and unquietness and at other times for their loud and vexatious tempers juno deserves them on the one hand jupiter thunders them out on the other and the learned gentlemen are very particular in enlarging with remarks on both sides in her first speech they make the poet describe the inquisitive temper of womankind in general and their restlesness if they are not admitted into every secret in his answer to this they trace those methods of grave remonstrance by which it is proper for husbands to calm them in her reply they find it is the nature of women to be more obstinate for being yielded to and in his second return to her they see the last method to be used with them upon failure of the first which is the exercise of sovereign authority  mr dryden has translated all this with the utmost severity upon the ladies and spirited the whole with satirical additions of his own but madam dacier who has elsewhere animadverted upon the good bishop of thessalonica for his sage admonitions against the fair sex has not taken the least notice of this general defection from complaisance in all the commentators she seems willing to give the whole passage a more important turn and incline us to think that homer designed to represent the folly and danger of prying into the secrets of providence it is thrown into that air in this translation not only as it is more noble and instructive in general but as it is more respectful to the ladies in particular nor should we any more than madam dacier have mentioned what those old fellows have said but to desire their protection against some modern critics their disciples who may arraign this proceeding  lii verse     rolled the large orbs the greek is  which is commonly translated the venerable oxeyd juno madam dacier very well observes that  is only an augmentative particle and signifies no more than valde it may be added that the imagination of oxen having larger eyes than ordinary is ill grounded and has no foundation in truth their eyes are no larger in proportion than those of men or of most other animals but be it as it will the design of the poet which is only to express the largeness of her eyes is answered in this paraphrase  liii verse     thus interposed the architect divine this quarrel of the gods being come to its height the poet makes vulcan interpose who freely puts them in mind of pleasure inoffensively advises juno illustrates his advice by an example of his own misfortune turning the jest on himself to enliven the banquet and concludes the part he is to support with serving nectar about homer had here his minerva or wisdom to interpose again and every other quality of the mind resided in heaven under the appearance of some deity so that his introducing vulcan proceeded not from a want of choice but an insight into nature he knew that a friend to mirth often diverts or stops quarrels especially when he contrives to submit himself to the laugh and prevails on the angry to part in good humor or in a disposition to friendship when grave representations are sometimes reproaches sometimes lengthen the debate by occasioning defenses and sometimes introduce new parties into the consequences of it  live verse   0 once in your cause i felt his matchless might they who search another vein of allegory for hidden knowledges in natural philosophy have considered jupiter and juno as heaven and the air whose alliance is interrupted when the air is troubled above but restored again when it is cleared by heat or vulcan the god of heat him they call a divine artificer from the activity or general use of fire in working they suppose him to be born in heaven where philosophers say that element has its proper place and is thence derived to the earth which is signified by the fall of vulcan that he fell in lemnos because that island abounds with subterranean fires and that he contracted a lameness or imperfection by the fall the fire not being so pure and active below but mixed and terrestrial eustathius  lvi verse     which with a smile the whitearmd queen received the epithet  or whitearmd is used by homer several times before in this book this was the first passage where it could be introduced with any ease or grace because the action she is here described in of extending her arm to the cup gives it an occasion of displaying its beauties and in a manner demands the epithet  lvii verse     laughter shakes the skies vulcan designed to move laughter by taking upon him the office of hebe and ganymede with his awkward limping carriage but though he prevailed and homer tells you the gods did laugh yet he takes care not to mention a word of lameness it would have been cruel in him and wit out of season to have enlarged with derision upon an imperfection which is out of ones power to remedy  according to this goodnatured opinion of eustathius mr dryden has treated vulcan a little barbarously he makes his character perfectly comical he is the jest of the board and the gods are very merry upon the imperfections of his figure chapman led him into this error in general as well as into some indecencies of expression in particular which will be seen upon comparing them  lviii verse     then to their starry domes the astrologers assign twelve houses to the planets wherein they are said to have dominion now because homer tells us vulcan built a mansion for every god the ancients write that he first gave occasion for this doctrine  lix verse   0 jove on his couch reclined his awful head eustathius makes a distinction between  and  the words which are used at the end of this book and the beginning of the next with regard to jupiters sleeping he says  only means lying down in a disposition to sleep which salves the contradiction that else would follow in the next book where it is said jupiter did not sleep i only mention this to vindicate the translation which differs from mr drydens  it has been remarked by the scholiasts that this is the only book of the twenty four without any simile a figure in which homer abounds every where else the like remark is made by madam dacier upon the first of the odysses and because the poet has observed the same conduct in both works it is concluded he thought a simplicily of style without the great figures was proper during the first information of the reader this observation may be true and admits of refined reasonings but for my part i cannot think the book had been the worse though he had thrown in as many similes as virgil has in the first aeneid  the second book of the iliad the argument the trial of the army and catalogue of the forces jupiter in pursuance of the request of thetis sends a deceitful vision to agamemnon persuading him to lead the army to battle in order to make the greeks sensible of their want of achilles the general who is deluded with the hopes of taking troy without his assistance but fears the army was discouraged by his absence and the late plague as well as by length of time contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem he first communicates his design to the princes in council that he would propose a return to the soldiers and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced then he assembles the whole host and upon moving for a return to greece they unanimously agree to it and run to prepare the ships they are detained by the management of ulysses who chastises the insolence of thersites the assembly is recalled several speeches made on the occasion and at length the advice of nestor followed which was to make a general muster of the troops and to divide them into their several nations before they proceeded to battle this gives occasion to the poet to ennumerate all the forces of the greeks and trojans in a large catalogue  the time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day the scene lies in the grecian camp and upon the seashore toward the end it removes to troy  the second book of the iliad now pleasing sleep had sealed each mortal eye stretched in the tents the grecian leaders lie the immortals slumberd on their thrones above all but the everwakeful eyes of jove to honor thetis son he bends his care and plunge the

scepter blazed the golden scepter of celestial frame by vulcan formed from jove to hermes came to pelops he the immortal gift resigned the immortal gift great pelops left behind in atreus hand which not with atreus ends to rich thyestes next the prize descends and now the mark of agamemnons reign subjects all argos and controuls the main on this bright scepter now the king reclined and artful thus pronounced the speech designed ye sons of mars partake your leaders care heroes of greece and brothers of the war of partial jove with justice i complain and heavenly oracles believed in vain a safe return was promised to our toils renowned triumphant and enriched with spoils our now shameful flight alone can save the host blood our treasure and our glory lost so jove decrees resistless lord of all at whose command whole empires rise or fall he shakes the feeble props of human trust and towns and armies humbles to the dust what shame to greece a fruitless war to wage oh lasting shame in every future age once great in arms the common scorn we grow repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe so small their number that if wars were ceased and greece triumphant held a general feast all ranked by tens whole decads when they dine must want a trojan slave to pour the wine but other forces have our hopes overthrown and troy prevails by armies not her own now nine long years of mighty jove are run since first the labors of this war begun our cordage torn decayed our vessels lie and scarce ensure the wretched power to fly haste then for ever leave the trojan wall our weeping wives our tender children call it is love duty safety summon us away natures voice and nature we obey our shattered barks may yet transport us over safe and inglorious to our native shore fly grecians fly your sails and oars employ and dream no more of heavndefended troy his deep design unknown the hosts approve atrides speech the mighty numbers move so roll the billows to the icarian shore from east and south when winds begin to roar burst their dark mansions in the clouds and sweep the whitening surface of the ruffled deep and as on corn when western gusts descend before the blast the lofty harvests bend thus over the field the moving host appears with nodding plumes and groves of waving spears the gathering murmur spreads their trampling feet beat the loose sands and thicken to the fleet with longresounding cries they urge the train to fit the ships and launch into the main they toil they sweat thick clouds of dust arise the doubling clamours echo to the skies even then the greeks had left the hostile plain and fate decreed the fall of troy in vain but joves imperial queen their flight surveyed and sighing thus bespoke the blueeyd maid shall then the grecians fly oh dire disgrace and leave unpunished this perfidious race shall troy shall priam and thadultrous spouse in peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows and bravest chiefs in helens quarrel slain lie unrevenged on yon detested plain no  let my greeks unmoved by vain alarms once more refulgent shine in brazen arms haste goddess haste the flying host detain nor let one sail be hoisted on the main pallas obeys and from olympus height swift to the ships precipitates her flight ulysses first in public cares she found for prudent counsel like the gods renowned oppressed with generous grief the hero stood nor drew his sable vessels to the flood and is it thus divine laertes son thus fly the greeks the martial maid begun thus to their country bear their own disgrace fame eternal leave to priams race shall beauteous helen still remain unfreed still unrevenged a thousand heroes bleed haste generous ithacus prevent the shame recall your armies and your chiefs reclaim your own resistless eloquence employ and to the immortals trust the fall of troy the voice divine confessed the warlike maid ulysses heard nor uninspird obeyed then meeting first atrides from his hand received the imperial scepter of command thus graced attention and respect to gain he runs he flies through all the grecian train each prince of name or chief in arms approved he fired with praise or with persuasion moved warriors like you with strength and wisdom blessed by brave examples should confirm the rest the monarchs will not yet revealed appears he tries our courage but resents our fears the unwary greeks his fury may provoke not thus the king in secret council spoke jove loves our chief from jove his honor springs beware for dreadful is the wrath of kings but if a clamorous vile plebeian rose him with reproof he checked or tamed with blows be still thou slave and to thy betters yield unknown alike in council and in field ye gods what dastards would our host command swept to the war the lumber of a land be silent wretch and think not here allowed that worst of tyrants an usurping crowd to one sole monarch jove commits the sway his are the laws and him let all obey with words like these the troops ulysses ruled the loudest silenced and the fiercest cooled back to the assembly roll the thronging train desert the ships and pour upon the plain murmuring they move as when old ocean roars and heaves huge surges to the trembling shores the groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound the rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound at length the tumult sinks the noises cease and a still silence lulls the camp to peace thersites only clamoured in the throng loquacious loud and turbulent of tongue awed by no shame by no respect controlled in scandal busy in reproaches bold with witty malice studious to defame scorn all his joy and laughter all his aim but chief he gloried with licentious style to lash the great and monarchs to revile his figure such as might his soul proclaim one eye was blinking and one leg was lame his mountainshoulders half his breast overspread thin hairs bestrewd his long misshapen head spleen to mankind his envious heart possessed and much he hated all but most the best ulysses or achilles still his theme but royal scandal his delight supreme long had he lived the scorn of every greek vexed when he spoke yet still they heard him speak sharp was his voice which in the shrillest tone thus with injurious taunts attacked the throne amidst the glories of so bright a reign what moves the great atrides to complain it is thine whatever the warriors breast inflames the golden spoil and thine the lovely dames with all the wealth our wars and blood bestow thy tents are crowded and thy chests overflow thus at full ease in heaps of riches rolled what grieves the monarch is it thirst of gold say shall we march with our unconquered powers the greeks and i to ilions hostile towers and bring the race of royal bastards here for troy to ransom at a price too dear but safer plunder thy own host supplies say would thou seize some valiant leaders prize or if thy heart to generous love be led some captive fair to bless thy kingly bed whatever our master craves submit we must plagued with his pride or punished for his lust oh women of achaia men no more hence let us fly and let him waste his store in loves and pleasures on the phrygian shore we may be wanted on some busy day when hector comes so great achilles may from him he forced the prize we jointly gave from him the fierce the fearless and the brave and durst he as he ought resent that wrong this mighty tyrant were no tyrant long fierce from his seat at this ulysses springs in generous vengeance of the king of kings with indignation sparkling in his eyes he views the wretch and sternly thus replies peace factious monster born to vex the state with wrangling talents formed for foul debate curb that impetuous tongue nor rashly vain and singly mad asperse the sovereign reign have we not known thee slave of all our host the man who acts the least upbraids the most think not the greeks to shameful flight to bring nor let those lips profane the name of king for our return we trust the heavenly powers be that their care to fight like men be ours but grant the host with wealth the general load except detraction what have thou bestowed suppose some hero should his spoils resign art thou that hero could those spoils be thine gods let me perish on this hateful shore and let these eyes behold my son no more if on thy next offense this hand forbear to strip those arms thou ill deserve to wear expel the council where our princes meet and send thee scourged and howling through the fleet he said and cowring as the dastard bends the weighty scepter on his back descends on the round bunch the bloody tumors rise the tears spring starting from his haggard eyes trembling he sat and shrunk in abject fears from his vile visage wiped the scalding tears while to his neighbor each expressed his thought ye gods what wonders has ulysses wrought what fruits his conduct and his courage yield great in the council glorious in the field generous he rises in the crowns defense to curb the factious tongue of insolence such just examples on offenders shown sedition silence and assert the throne twas thus the general voice the hero praised who rising high the imperial scepter raised the blueeyd pallas his celestial friend in form a herald bade the crowds attend the expecting crowds in still attention hung to hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue then deeply thoughtful pausing ere he spoke his silence thus the prudent hero broke unhappy monarch whom the grecian race with shame deserting heap with vile disgrace not such at argos was their generous vow once all their voice but ah forgotten now never to return was then the common cry till troys proud structures should in ashes lie behold them weeping for their native shore what could their wives or helpless children more what heart but melts to leave the tender train and one short month endure the wintry main few leagues removed we wish our peaceful seat when the ship tosses and the tempests beat then well may this long stay provoke their tears the tedious length of nine revolving years not for their grief the grecian host i blame but vanquished baffled oh eternal shame expect the time to troys destruction given and try the faith of calchas and of heaven what past at aulis greece can witness bear and all who live to breathe this phrygian air beside a fountains sacred brink we raised our verdant altars and the victims blazed it was where the planetree spread its shades around the altars heaved and from the crumbling ground a mighty dragon shot of dire portent from jove himself the dreadful sign was sent strait to the tree his sanguine spires he rolled and curled around in many a winding fold the topmost branch a motherbird possessed eight callow infants filled the mossie nest herself the ninth the serpent as he hung stretched his black jaws and crashd the crying young while hovering near with miserable moan the drooping mother waild her children gone the mother last as round the nest she flew seized by the beating wing the monster slew nor long survived to marble turned he stands a lasting prodigy on aulis sands such was the will of jove and hence we dare trust in his omen and support the war for while around we gazed with wondering eyes and trembling sought the powers with sacrifice full of his god the reverend calchas cried ye grecian warriors lay your fears aside this wondrous signal jove himself displays of long long labors but eternal praise as many birds as by the snake were slain so many years the toils of greece remain but wait the tenth for ilions fall decreed thus spoke the prophet thus the fates succeed obey ye grecians with submission wait nor let your flight avert the trojan fate he said the shores with loud applauses sound the hollow ships each deafning shout rebound then nestor thus  these vain debates forbear ye talk like children not like heroes dare where now are all your high resolves at last your leagues concluded your engagements past vowed with libations and with victims then now vanished like their smoke the faith of men while useless words consume the unactive hours no wonder troy so long resists our powers rise great atrides and with courage sway we march to war if thou direct the way but leave the few that dare resist thy laws the mean deserters of the grecian cause to grudge the conquests mighty jove prepares and view with envy our successful wars on that great day when first the martial train big with the fate of ilion plowed the main jove on the right a prosperous signal sent and thunder rolling shook the firmament encouraged hence maintain the glorious strife till every soldier grasp a phrygian wife till helens woes at full revenged appear and troys proud matrons render tear for tear before that day if any greek invite his countrys troops to base inglorious flight stand forth that greek and hoist his sail to fly and dye the dastard first who dreads to dye but now o monarch all thy chiefs advise nor what they offer thou thy self despise among those counsels let not mine be vain in tribes and nations to divide thy train his separate troops let every leader call each strengthen each and all encourage all what chief or soldier of the numerous band or bravely fights or ill obeys command when thus distinct they war shall soon be known and what the cause of ilion not overthrown if fate resists or if our arms are slow if gods above prevent or men below to him the king how much thy years excel in arts of council and in speaking well oh would the gods in love to greece decree but ten such sages as they grant in thee such wisdom soon should priams force destroy and soon should fall the haughty towers of troy but jove forbids who plunges those he hates in fierce contention and in vain debates now great achilles from our aid withdraws by me provoked a captive maid the cause if ever as friends we join the trojan wall must shake and heavy will the vengeance fall but now ye warriors take a short repast and well refreshed to bloody conflict haste his sharpened spear let every grecian wield and every grecian fix his brazen shield let all excite the fiery steeds of war and all for combat fit the rattling car this day this dreadful day let each contend no rest no respite till the shades descend till darkness or till death shall cover all let the war bleed and let the mighty fall till bathed in sweat be every manly breast with the huge shield each brawny arm deprest each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw and each spent courser at the chariot blow who dares inglorious in his ships to stay who dares to tremble on this signal day that wretch too mean to fall by martial power the birds shall mangle and the dogs devour the monarch spoke and strait a murmur rose loud as the surges when the tempest blows that dashed on broken rocks tumultuous roar and foam and thunder on the stony shore strait to the tents the troops dispersing bend the fires are kindled and the smokes ascend with hasty feasts they sacrifice and pray tavert the dangers of the doubtful day a steer of five years age large limbed and fed to joves high altars agamemnon led there bade the noblest of the grecian peers and nestor first as most advanced in years next came idomeneus and tydeus son ajax the less and ajax telamon then wise ulysses in his rank was placed and menelaus came unbid the last the chiefs surround the destined beast and take the sacred offering of the salted cake when thus the king prefers his solemn prayer oh thou whose thunder rends the clouded air who in the heaven of heavens have fixed thy throne supreme of gods unbounded and alone hear and before the burning sun descends before the night her gloomy veil extends low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires be priams palace sunk in grecian fires in hectors breast be plunged this shining sword and slaughtered heroes groan around their lord thus prayed the chief his unavailing prayer great jove refused and tossed in empty air the god averse while yet the fumes arose prepared new toils and doubled woes on woes their prayers performed the chiefs the rite pursue the barley sprinkled and the victim slew the limbs they sever from the enclosing hyde the thighs selected to the gods divide on these in double cauls involved with art the choicest morsels lie from every part from the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire while the fat victim feeds the sacred fire the thighs thus sacrificed and entrails dressed thassistants part transfix and roast the rest then spread the tables the repast prepare each takes his seat and each receives his share soon as the rage of hunger was suppressed the generous nestor thus the prince addressed now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms and call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms now seize the occasion now the troops survey and lead to war when heaven directs the way he said the monarch issued his commands strait the loud heralds call the gathering bands the chiefs enclose their king the hosts divide in tribes and nations ranked on either side high in the midst the blueeyd virgin flies from rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes the dreadful aegis joves immortal shield blazed on her arm and lightened all the field round the vast orb an hundred serpents rolled formed the bright fringe and seemed to burn in gold with this each grecians manly breast she warms swells their bold hearts and strings their nervous arms no more they sigh inglorious to return but breathe revenge and for the combat burn as on some mountain through the lofty grove the crackling flames ascend and blaze above the fires expanding as the winds arise shoot their long beams and kindle half the skies so from the polished arms and brazen shields a gleamy splendour flashed along the fields not less their number than the embodied cranes or milkwhite swans in asius watery plains that over the windings of caysters springs stretch their long necks and clap their rustling wings now tower aloft

the warlike bands that distant lycia yields where gulphy xanthus foams along the fields observations on the second book observations on the second book i verse   now pleasing sleep etc aristotle tells us in the twenty sixth chapter of his art of poetry that this place had been objected to by some critics in those times they thought it gave a very ill idea of the military discipline of the greeks to represent a whole army unguarded and all the leaders asleep they also pretended it was ridiculous to describe all the gods sleeping besides jupiter to both these aristotle answers that nothing is more usual or allowable than that figure which puts all for the greater part one may add with respect to the latter criticism that nothing could give a better image of the superiority of jupiter to the other gods or of the supreme being to all second causes than the vigilance here ascribed to him over all things divine and human  ii verse   fly hence deluding dream it appears from aristotle poet cap    that homer was accused of impiety for making jupiter the author of a lie in this passage it seems there were anciently these words in his speech to the dream  let us give him great glory instead of which we have in the present copies  but hippias found a way to bring off homer only by placing the accent on the last syllable but one  for  the infinitive for the imperative which amounts to no more than that he bade the dream to promise him great glory but macrobius de somnio scip l   c   takes off this imputation entirely and will not allow there was any lie in the case  agamemnon says he was ordered by the dream to lead out all the forces of the greeks  is the word and promised the victory on that condition now achilles and his forces not being summoned to the assembly with the rest that neglect absolved jupiter from his promise this remark madam dacier has inserted without mentioning its author mr dacier takes notice of a passage in the scripture exactly parallel to this where god is represented making use of the malignity of his creatures to accomplish his judgments it is in   chronicles chapter        0    and the lord said who will persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramoth gilead and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will persuade him and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shall persuade him and prevail also go forth and do so vide dacier upon aristotle cap     iii verse  0 descends and hovers over atrides head the whole action of the dream is beautifully natural and agreeable to philosophy it perches on his head to intimate that part to be the seat of the soul it is circumfused about him to express that total possession of the senses which fancy has during our sleeps it takes the figure of the person who was dearest to agamemnon as whatever we think of most when awake is the common object of our dreams and just at the instant of its vanishing it leaves such an impression that the voice seems still to sound in his ear no description can be more exact or lively eustathius dacier  iv verse    draw forth the embatteld train etc the dream here repeats the message of jupiter in the same terms that he received it it is no less than the father of gods and men who gives the order and to alter a word were presumption homer constantly makes his envoys observe this practice as a mark of decency and respect madam dacier and others have applauded this in general and asked by what authority an ambassador could alter the terms of his commission since he is not greater or wiser than the person who gave the charge but this is not always the case in our author who not only makes use of this conduct with respect to the orders of a higher power but in regard to equals also as when one goddess desires another to represent such an affair and she immediately takes the words from her mouth and repeats them of which we have an instance in this book some objection too may be raised to this manner when commissions are given in the utmost haste in a battle or the like upon sudden emergencies where it seems not very natural to suppose a man has time to get so many words by heart as he is made to repeat exactly in the present instance the repetition is certainly graceful though zenodotus thought it not so the third time when agamemnon tells his dream to the council i do not pretend to decide upon the point for though the reverence of the repetition seemed less needful in that place than when it was delivered immediately from jupiter yet as eustathius observes it was necessary for the assembly to know the circumstances of this dream that the truth of the relation might be unsuspected  v verse    now valiant chiefs etc the best commentary extant upon the first part of this book is in dionysius of halicarnassus who has given us an admirable explication of this whole conduct of agamemnon in his second treatise  he says this prince had nothing so much at heart as to draw the greeks to a battle yet knew not how to proceed without achilles who had just retired from the army and was apprehensive that the greeks who were displeased at the departure of achilles might refuse obedience to his orders should he absolutely command it in this circumstance he proposes to the princes in council to make a trial of arming the graecians and offers an expedient himself which was that he should sound their dispositions by exhorting him to set sail for greece but that then the other princes should be ready to dissuade and detain them if any object to this stratagem that agamemnons whole scheme would be ruined if the army should take him at his word which was very probable it is to be answered that his design lay deeper than they imagine nor did he depend upon his speech only for detaining them he had some cause to fear the greeks had a pique against him which they had concealed and whatever it was he judged it absolutely necessary to know it before he proceeded to a battle he therefore furnishes them with an occasion to manifest it and at the same time provides against any ill effects it might have by his secret orders to the princes it succeeds accordingly and when the troops are running to embark they are stopped by ulysses and nestor  one may farther observe that this whole stratagem is concerted in nestors ship as one whose wisdom and secrecy was most confided in the story of the visions appearing in his shape could not but engage him in some degree it looked as if jupiter himself added weight to his counsels by making use of that venerable appearance and knew this to be the most powerful method of recommending them to agamemnon it was therefore but natural for nestor to second the motion of the king and by the help of his authority it prevailed on the other princes  vi verse     as from some rocky cleft this is the first simile in homer and we may observe in general that he excels all mankind in the number variety and beauty of his comparisons there are scarce any in virgil which are not translated from him and therefore when he succeeds best in them he is to be commended but as an improver scaliger seems not to have thought of this when he compares the similes of these two authors as indeed they are the places most obvious to comparison the present passage is an instance of it to which he opposes the following verses in the first aeneid qualis apes aestate nova per florea rura exercet sub sole labor cum gentis adultos educunt foetus aut cum liquentia mella stipant and dulci distendunt nectare cellas aut onera accipiunt venientum aut agmine facto ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent fervet opus redolentque thymo fragrantia mella this he very much prefers to homers and in particular extols the harmony and sweetness of the versification above that of our author against which censure we need only appeal to the ears of the reader     etc but scaliger was unlucky in his choice of this particular comparison there is a very fine one in the sixth aeneid  0  that better agrees with homers and nothing is more evident than that the design of these two is very different homer intended to describe the multitude of greeks pouring out of the ships virgil the diligence and labor of the builders at carthage and macrobius who observes this difference sat l   c    should also have found that therefore the similes ought not to be compared together the beauty of homers is not inferior to virgils if we consider with what exactness it answers to its end it consists of three particulars the vast number of the troops is expressed in the swarms their tumultuous manner of issuing out of the ships and the perpetual egression which seemed without end are imaged in the bees pouring out of the rock and lastly their dispersion over all the shore in their descending on the flowers in the vales spondanus was therefore mistaken when he thought the whole application of this comparison lay in the single word  catervatim as chapman has justly observed  vii verse     fame flies before this assembling of the army is full of beauties the lively description of their overspreading the field the noble boldness of the figure when fame is represented in person shining at their head the universal tumult succeeded by a solemn silence and lastly the graceful rising of agamemnon all contribute to cast a majesty on this part in the passage of the scepter homer has found an artful and poetical manner of acquainting us with the high descent of agamemnon and celebrating the hereditary right of his family as well as finely hinted the original of his power to be derived from heaven in saying the scepter was first the gift of jupiter it is with reference to this that in the line where he first mentions it he calls it  and accordingly it is translated in that place  viii verse     and artful thus pronounced the speech designed the remarks of dionysius upon this speech i shall give the reader altogether though they lie scattered in his two discourses  the second of which is in a great degree but a repetition of the precepts and examples of the first this happened i believe from his having composed them at distinct times and upon different occasions  it is an exquisite piece of art when you seem to aim at persuading one thing and at the same time enforce the contrary this kind of rhetoric is of great use in all occasions of danger and is what homer has afforded a most powerful example of in the oration of agamemnon it is a method perfectly wonderful and even carries in it an appearance of absurdity for all that we generally esteem the faults of oratory by this means become the virtues of it nothing is looked upon as a greater error in a rhetorician than to allege such arguments as either are easily answered or may be retorted upon himself the former is a weak part the latter a dangerous one and agamemnon here designedly deals in both for it is plain that if a man must not use weak arguments or such as may make against him when he intends to persuade the thing he says then on the other side when he does not intend it he must observe the contrary proceeding and make what are the faults of oratory in general the excellencies of that oration in particular or otherwise he will contradict his own intention and perssuade the contrary to what he means agamemnon begins with an argument easily answered by telling them that jupiter had promised to crown their arms with victory for if jupiter had promised this it was a reason for the stay in the camp but now says he jove has deceived us and we must return with ignominy this is another of the same kind for it shows what a disgrace it is to return what follows is of the second sort and may be turned against him jove will have it so for which they have only agamemnons word but joves own promise for the contrary that god has overthrown many cities and will yet overturn many others this was a strong reafon to stay and put their confidence in him it is shameful to have it told to all posterity that so many thousand greeks after a war of so long continuance at last returned home baffled and unsuccessful all this might have been said by a professed adversary to the cause he pleads and indeed is the same thing ulysses says elsewhere in reproach of their flight the conclusion evidently shows the intent of the speaker haste then let us fly  the word which of all others was most likely to prevail upon them to stay the most open term of disgrace he could possibly have used it is the same which juno makes use of to minerva minerva to ulysses and ulysses again to the troops to dissuade their return the same which agamemnon himself had used to insult achilles and which homer never employs but with the mark of cowardice and infamy  the same author farther observes that this whole oration has the air of being spoken in a passion it begins with a stroke of the greatest rashness and impatience jupiter has been unjust heaven has deceived us this renders all he shall say of the less authority at the same time that it conceals his own artifice for his anger seems to account for the incongruities he utters i could not suppress so fine a remark though it falls out of the order of those which precede it  before i leave this article i must take notice that this speech of agamemnon is again put into his mouth in the ninth iliad and according to dionysius for the same purpose to detain the army at the siege after a defeat though it seems unartful to put the same trick twice upon the greeks by the same person and in the same words too we may indeed suppose the first feint to have remained undiscovered but at best it is a management in the poet not very entertaining to the readers  ix verse     so small their number etc this part has a low air in comparison with the rest of the speech scaliger calls it tabernariam orationem but it is well observed by madam dacier that the image agamemnon here gives of the trojans does not only render their numbers contemptible in comparison of the greeks but their persons too for it makes them appear but as a few vile slaves fit only to serve them with wine to which we may add that it affords a prospect to his soldiers of their future state and triumph after the conquest of their enemies  this passage gives me occasion to animadvert upon a computation of the number of the trojans which the learned angelus politian has offered at in his preface to homer he thinks they were fifty thousand without the auxiliaries from the conclusion of the eighth iliad where it is said there were a thousand funeral piles of trojans and fifty men attending each of them but that the auxiliaries are to be admitted into that number appears plainly from this place agamemnon expressly distinguishes the native trojans from the aids and reckons but one to ten graecians at which estimate there could not be above ten thousand trojans see the notes on the catalogue  x verse      decayed our vessels lie and scarce ensure the wretched power to fly this and some other passages are here translated correspondent to the general air and sense of this speech rather than just to the letter the telling them in this place how much their shipping was decayed was a hint of their danger in returning as madam dacier has remarked  xi verse     so roll the billows etc one may take notice that homer in these two similitudes has judiciously made choice of the two most wavering and inconstant things in nature to compare with the multitude the waves and ears of corn the first alludes to the noise and tumult of the people in the breaking and rolling of the billows the second to their taking the same course like corn bending one way and both to the easiness with which they are moved by every breath  xii verse     to one sole monarch those persons are under a mistake who would make this sentence a praise of absolute monarchy homer speaks it only with regard to a general of an army during the time of his commission nor is agamemnon styled king of kings in any other sense than as the rest of the princes had given him the supreme authority over them in the siege aristotle defines a king  leader of the war judge of controversies and president of the ceremonies of the gods that he had the principal care of religious rites appears from many places in homer and that his power was no where absolute but in war for we find agamemnon insulted in the council but in the army threatening deserters with death he was under an obligation to preserve the privileges of his country pursuant to which kings are called by our author  and  the dispensers or managers of justice and dionysius of halicarnassus acquaints us that the old grecian kings whether hereditary or elective had a council of their chief men as homer and the most ancient poets testify nor was it he adds in those times as in ours when kings have a full liberty to do whatever they please dion hal lib   hist  xiii verse     thersites only the ancients have ascribed to homer the first sketch of satyric or comic poetry of which sort was his poem called margites as aristotle reports though that piece be lost this character of thersites may give us a taste of his vein in that kind but whether ludicrous descriptions ought to have place in the epic poem has been justly questioned neither virgil nor any of the most approved ancients have thought fit to admit them into their compositions of that nature nor any of the best moderns except milton whose fondness for homer might be the reason of it however this is in its kind a very masterly part and our author has shown great judgment in the particulars he has chosen to compose the picture of a pernicious creature of wit the chief of which are a desire of promoting laughter at any rate and a contempt of his superiors and he sums up the whole very strongly by saying that thersites hated achilles and ulysses in which as plutarch has remarked in his treatise of envy and hatred he makes it the utmost completion of an ill character to bear a malevolence to the best men what is farther observable is that thersites is never heard of after this his first appearance such a scandalous character is to be taken no more notice of than just to show that it is despised homer has observed the same conduct with regard to the most deformed and most beautiful person of his poem for nireus is thus mentioned once and no more throughout the ilaid he places a worthless beauty and an illnatured wit upon the same foot and shows that the gifts of the body without those of the mind are not more despicable than those of the mind itself without virtue  xiv verse     amidst the glories it is remarked by dionysius halicar in his treatise of the examination of writers that there could not be a better artifice thought on to recall the army to their obedience than this of our author when they were offended at their general in favor of achilles nothing could more weaken achilless interest than to make such a fellow as thersites appear of his party whose impertinence would give them a disgust of thinking or acting like him there is no surer method to reduce generous spirits than to make them see they are pursuing the same views with people of no merit and such whom they cannot forbear despising themselves otherwise there is nothing in this speech but what might become the mouth of nestor himself if you except a word or two and had nestor spoken it the army had certainly set sail for greece but because it was uttered by a ridiculous fellow whom they are ashamed to follow they are reduced and satisfied to continue the siege  xv verse     the greeks and i these boasts of himself are the few words which dionysius objects to in the foregoing passage i cannot but think the grave commentators here very much mistaken who imagine thersites in earnest in these vaunts and seriously reprove his insolence they seem to me manifest strokes of irony which had rendered them so much the more improper in the mouth of nestor who was otherwise none of the least boasters himself and considered as such they are equal to the rest of the speech which has an infinite deal of spirit humor and satyr  xvi verse     he said and cowring the vile figure thersites makes here is a good piece of grotesque the pleasure expressed by the soldiers at this action of ulysses notwithstanding they are disappointed by him of their hopes of returning is agreeable to that generous temper at once honest and thoughtless which is commonly found in military men to whom nothing is so odious as a dastard and who have not naturally the greatest kindness for a wit  xvii verse     unhappy monarch etc quintilian speaking of the various kinds of oratory which may be learned from homer mentions among the greatest instances the speeches in this book nonne vel unus liber quo missa ad achillem legatio continetur vel in primo inter duces illa contentio vel dictae in secundo sententiae omnes litium ac consiliorum explicat arts affectus quidem vel illos mites vel hos concitatos nemo erit tam indoctus qui non sua in potestate hunc autorem habuisse fateatur it is indeed hardly possible to find any where more refined turns of policy or more artful touches of oratory we have no sooner seen agamemnon excel in one sort but ulysses is to shine no less in another directly opposite to it when the stratagem of pretending to set sail had met with too ready a consent from the people his eloquence appears in all the forms of art in his first speech he had persuaded the captains with mildness telling them the peoples glory depended upon them and readily giving a turn to the first design which had like to have been so dangerous by representing it only as a project of agamemnon to discover the cowardly in his second he had commanded the soldiers with bravery and made them know what part they sustained in the war in his third he had rebuked the seditious in the person of thersites by reproofs threats and actual chastisements and now in this fourth when all are gathered he applies to them in topics which equally affect them all he raises their hearts by putting them in mind of the promises of heaven and those prophecies of which as they had seen the truth in the nine years delay they might now expect the accomplishment in the tenth years success which is a full answer to what agamemnon had said of jupiters deceiving them  dionysius observes one singular piece of art in ulyssess manner of applying himself to the people when he would insinuate any thing to the princes and addressing to the princes when he would blame the people he tells the soldiers they must not all pretend to be rulers there let there be one king one lord which is manifestly a precept designed for the leaders to take to themselves in the same manner tiberius rhetor remarks the beginning of his last oration to be a fine ethopopeia or oblique representation of the people upon whom the severity of the reproach is made to fall while he seems to render the king an object of their pity unhappy monarch whom the grecian race with shame deserting etc   xviii verse  0  then nestor thus nothing is more observable than homers conduct of this whole incident by what judicious and wellimagined degrees the army is restrained and wrought up to the desires of the general we have given the detail of all the methods ulysses proceeded in the activity of his character is now to be contrasted with the gravity of nestors who covers and strengthens the others arguments and constantly appears through the poem a weighty closer of debates the greeks had already seen their general give way to his authority in the dispute with achilles in the former book and could expect no less than that their stay should be concluded on by agamemnon as soon as nestor undertook that cause for this was all they imagined his discourse aimed at but we shall find it had a farther design from dionysius of halicarnassus there are two things says that excellent critic worthy of admiration in the speeches of ulysses and nestor which are the different designs they speak with and the different applauses they receive ulysses has the acclamations of the army and nestor the praise of agamemnon one may enquire the reason why he extols the latter preferably to the former when all that nestor alleges seems only a repetition of the same arguments which ulysses had given before him it might be done in encouragement to the old man in whom it might raise a concern to find his speech not followed with so general an applause as the others but we are to refer the speech of nestor to that part of oratory which seems only to confirm what another has said and yet superinduces and carries a farther point ulysses and nestor both compare the greeks to children for their unmanly desire to return home they both reproach them with the engagements and vows they had past and were now about to break they both allege the prosperous signs and omens received from heaven notwithstanding this the end of their orations is very different ulyssess business was to detain the graecians when they were upon the point of flying nestor finding that work done to his hands designed to draw them instantly to battle this was the utmost agamemnon had aimed at which nestors artifice brings to pass for while they imagine by all he says that he is only persuading them to stay they find themselves unawares put into order of battle and led under their princes to fight dion hal  part   and    we may next take notice of some particulars of this speech where he says they lose their time in empty words he hints at the dispute between agamemnon and achilles where he speaks of those who deserted the grecian cause he glances at achilles in particular when he represents helen in affliction and tears he removes the odium from the person in whose cause they were to fight and when he moves agamemnon to advise with his council artfully prepares for a reception of his own advice by that modest way of proposing it as for the advice itself to divide the army into bodies each of which should be composed entirely of men of the same country nothing could be better judged both in regard to the present circumstance and with an eye to the future carrying on of the war for the first its immediate effect was to take the whole army out of its tumult break whatever cabals they might have formed together by separating them into a new division and cause every single mutineer to come instantly under the view of his own proper officer for correction for the second it was to be thought the army would be much strengthened by this union those of different nations who had different aims interests and friendships could not assist each other with so much zeal or so well concur to the same end as when friends aided friends kinsmen their kinsmen etc when each commander had the glory of his own nation in view and a greater emulation was excited between body and body as not only warring for the honor of greece in general but for that of every distinct state in particular  xix verse   0 how much thy years excel every one has observed how glorious an elogium of wisdom homer has here given where agamemnon so far prefers it to valor as to wish not for ten ajaxs or achilless but only for ten nestors for the rest of this speech dionysius has summed it up as follows  agamemnon being now convinced the greeks were offended at him on account of the departure of achilles pacifies them by a generous confession of his fault but then asserts the character of a supreme ruler and with the air of command threatens the disobedient i cannot conclude this part of the speeches without remarking how beautifully they rise above one another and how they more and more awaken the spirit of war in the graecians in this last there is a wonderful fire and vivacity when he prepares them for the glorious toils they were to undergo by a warm and lively description of them the repetition of the words in that part has a beauty which as well as many others of the same kind has been lost by most translators     i cannot but believe milton had this passage in his eye in that of his sixth book  let each his adamantine coat gird well and each fit well his helm gripe fast his orbed shield etc   xx verse     and menelaus came unbid the critics have entered into a warm dispute whether menelaus was in the right or in the wrong in coming uninvited some maintaining it the part of an impertinent or a fool to intrude upon another mans table and others insisting upon the privilege a brother or a kinsman may claim in this case the english reader had not been troubled with the translation of this word  but that plato and plutarch have taken notice of the passage the verse following this in most editions  etc being rejected as spurious by demetrius phalereus is omitted here upon his authority  xxi verse     the dreadful aegis jove s immortal shield homer does not expressly call it a shield in this place but he does in the fifth iliad where this aegis is described with a sublimity that is inexpressible the figure of the gorgons head upon it is there specified which will justify the mention of the serpents in the translation here the verses are remarkably sonorous in the original the image of the goddess of battles blazing with her immortal shield before the army inspiring every hero and assisting to range the troops is agreeable to the bold painting of our author and the encouragement of a divine power seemed no more than was requisite to change so totally the dispositions of the graecians as to make them now more ardent for the combat than they were before desirous of a return this finishes the conquest of their inclinations in a manner at once wonderfully poetical and correspondent to the moral which is every where spread through homer that nothing is entirely brought about but by the divine assistance  xxii verse     as on some mountain etc the imagination of homer was so vast and so lively that whatsoever objects presented themselves before him impressed their images so forcibly that he poured them forth in comparisons equally simple and noble without forgetting any circumstance which could instruct the reader and make him see those objects in the same strong light wherein he saw them himself and in this one of the principal beauties of poetry consists homer on the sight of the march of this numerous army gives us five similes in a breath but all entirely different the first regards the splendour of their armor as a fire etc the second the various movements of so many thousands before they can range themselves in battelarray like the swans etc the third respects their number as the leaves or flowers etc the fourth the ardour with which they run to the combat like the legions of insects etc and the fifth the obedience and exact discipline of the troops ranged without confusion under their leaders as flocks under their shepherds this fecundity and variety can never be enough admired dacier  xxiii verse     or milk white swans on asius watery plains scaliger who is seldom just to our author yet confesses these verses to be plenissima nectaris but he is greatly mistaken when he accuses this simile of impropriety on the supposition that a number of birds flying without order are here compared to an army ranged in array of battle on the contrary homer in this expresses the stir and tumult the troops were in before they got into order running together from the ships and tents  but when they are placed in their ranks he compares them to the flocks under their shepherds this distinction will plainly appear from the detail of the five similes in the foregoing note  virgil has imitated this with great happiness in his seventh aeneid ceu quondam nivei liquida inter nubila cycni cum sese e pastu referunt and longa canoros dant per colla modos sonat amnis and asia long pulsa palus  like a long team of snowy swans on high which clap their wings and cleave the liquid sky when homeward from their watery pastures born they sing and asias lakes their notes return mr dryden in this place has mistaken asius for asia which virgil took care to distinguish by making the first syllable of asius long as of asia short though if we believe madam dacier he was himself in an error both here and in the first georgic  quae asia circum dulcibus in stagnis rimantur prata caystri for she will not allow that  can be a patronymic adjective but the genitive of a proper name  which being turned into ionic is  and by a syncope makes  this puts me in mind of another criticism upon the   0th verse of this book it is observed that virgil uses inarime for arime as if he had read  instead of  scaliger ridicules this trivial remark and asks if it can be imagined that virgil was ignorant of the name of a place so near him as baiae it is indeed unlucky for good writers that men who have learning should lay a stress upon such trifles and that those who have none should think it learning to do so  xxiv verse     or thick as insects play this simile translated literally runs thus as the numerous troops of flies about a shepherds cottage in the spring when the milk moistens the pails such numbers of greeks stood in the field against the trojans desiring their destruction the lowness of this image in comparison with those which precede it will naturally shock a modern critic and would scarce be forgiven in a poet of these times the utmost a translator can do is to heighten the expression so as to render the disparity less observable which is endeavored here and in other places if this be done successfully the reader is so far from being offended at a low idea that it raises his surprise to find it grown great in the poets hands of which we have frequent instances in virgils georgicks here follows another of the same kind in the simile of agamemnon to a bull just after he has been compared to jove mars and neptune this eustathius tells us was blamed by some critics and mr hobbes has left it out in his translation the liberty has been taken here to place the humbler simile first reserving the noble one as a more magnificent close of the description the bare turning the sentence removes the objection milton who was a close imitator of our author has often copied him in these humble comparisons he has not scrupled to insert one in the midst of that pompous description of the rout of the rebelangels in the sixth book where the son of god in all his dreadful majesty is represented pouring his vengeance upon them  as a herd of goats or timorous flocks together thronged drove them before him thunderstruck    xxv verse     great as the gods homer here describes the figure and port of agamemnon with all imaginable grandeur in making him appear clothed with the majesty of the greatest of the gods and when plutarch in his second oration of the fortune of alexander blamed the comparison of a man to three deities at once that censure was not passed upon homer as a poet but by plutarch as a priest this character of majesty in which agamemnon excels all the other heroes is preserved in the different views of him throughout the iliad it is thus he appears on his ship in the catalogue thus he shines in the eyes of priam in the third book thus again in the beginning of the thirteenth and so in the rest  xxvi verse     say virgins it is hard to conceive any address more solemn any opening to a subject more noble and magnificent than this invocation of homer before his catalogue that omnipresence he gives to the muses their post in the highest heaven their comprehensive survey through the whole extent of the creation are circumstances greatly imagined nor is any thing more perfectly fine or exquisitely moral than the opposition of the extensive knowledge of the divinities on the one side to the blindness and ignorance of mankind on the other the greatness and importance of his subject is highly raised by his exalted manner of declaring the difficulty of it not though my lungs were brass etc and by the air he gives as if what follows were immediately inspired and no less than the joint labor of all the muses  xxvii verse     the hardy warriors the catalogue begins in this place which i forbear to treat of at present only i must acknowledge here that the translation has not been exactly punctual to the order in which homer places his towns however it has not trespassed against geography the transpositions i mention being no other than such minute ones as strabo confesses the author himself is not free from  lib   there is not to my remembrance any place throughout this catalogue omitted a liberty which mr dryden has made no difficulty to take and to confess in his virgil but a more scrupulous care was owing to homer on account of that wonderful exactness and unequaled diligence which he has particularly shown in this part of his work  xxviii verse     down their broad shoulders etc the greek has it  a tergo comantes it was the custom of these people to shave the forepart of their heads which they did that their enemies might not take the advantage of seizing them by the hair the hinder part they let grow as a valiant race that would never turn their backs their manner of fighting was hand to hand without quitting their javelins in the way of our pikemen plutarch tells us this in the life of theseus and cites to strengthen the authority of homer some verses of archilochus to the same effect eobanus hessus who translated homer into latin verse was therefore mistaken in his version of this passage praecipue jaculatores hastamque periti vibrare and longis contingere pectora telis   xxix verse     eager and loud from man to man he flies the figure menelaus makes in this place is remarkably distinguished from the rest and sufficient to show his concern in the war was personal while the others acted only for interest or glory in general no leader in all the list is represented thus eager and passionate he is louder than them all in his exhortations more active in running among the troops and inspirited with the thoughts of revenge which he still increases with the secret imagination of helens repentance this behavior is finely imagined  the epithet  which is applied in this and other places to menelaus and which literally signifies loudvoiced is made by the commentators to mean valiant and translated bello strenuus the reason given by eustathius is that a loud voice is a mark of strength the usual effect of fear being to cut short the respiration i own this seems to be forced and rather believe it was one of those kind of sirnames given from some distinguishing quality of the person as that of a loud voice might belong to menelaus which mons boileau mentions in his ninth reflection upon longinus in the same manner as some of our kings were called edward longshanks william rufus etc but however it be the epithet taken in the literal sense has a beauty in this verse from the circumstance menelaus is described in which determined the translator to use it  xxx verse     new to all the dangers of the main the arcadians being an inland people were unskilled in navigation for which reason agamemnon furnished them with shipping from hence and from the last line of the description of the scepter where he is said to preside over many islands thucydides takes occasion to observe that the power of agamemnon was superior to the rest of the princes of greece on account of his naval forces which had rendered him master of the sea thucyd lib    xxxi verse     three ships with nireus this leader is no where mentioned but in these lines and is an exception to the observation of macrobius that all the persons of the catalogue make their appearance afterward in the poem homer himself gives us the reason because nireus had but a small share of worth and valor his quality only gave him a privilege to be named among men the poet has caused him to be remembered no less than achilles or ulysses but yet in no better manner than he deserved whose only qualification was his beauty it is by a bare repetition of his name three times which just leaves some impression of him on the mind of the reader many others of as trivial memory as nireus have been preserved by poets from oblivion but few poets have ever done this favor to want of merit with so much judgment demetrius phalereus  sect    takes notice of this beautiful repetition which in a just deference to so delicate a critic is here preserved in the translation  xxxii verse     the grace and glory of the beauteous kind he gives alcestis this elogy of the glory of her sex for her conjugal piety who died to preserve the life of her husband admetus euripides has a tragedy on this subject which abounds in the most masterly strokes of tenderness in particular the first act which contains the description of her preparation for death and her behavior in it can never be enough admired  xxxiii verse  0  in twenty ships the bold perrhaebians came i cannot tell whether it be worth observing that except ogilby we have not met with one translator who has exactly preserved the number of the ships chapman puts eighteen under eumelus instead of eleven hobbes but twenty under ascalaphus and ialmen instead of thirty and but thirty under menelaus instead of sixty valterie the former french translator has given agapenor forty for sixty and nestor forty for ninety madam dacier gives nestor but eighty i must confess this translation not to have been quite so exact as ogilbys having cut off one from the number of eumeluss ships and two from those of guneus eleven and two and twenty would sound but oddly in english verse and a poem contracts a littleness by insisting on such trivial niceties  xxxiv verse     or reind the noblest steeds this coupling together the men and horses seems odd enough but homer every where treats these noble animals with remarkable regard we need not wonder at this enquiry which were the best horses from him who makes his horses of heavenly extraction as well as his heroes who makes his warriors address them with speeches and excite them by all those motives which affect a human breast who describes them sheding tears of sorrow and even capable of voice and prophecy in most of which points virgil has not scrupled to imitate him  xxxv verse     his troops etc the image in these lines of the amusements of the myrmidons while achilles detained them from the fight has an exquisite propriety in it though they are not in action their very diversions are military and a kind of exercise of arms the covered chariot and feeding horses make a natural part of the picture and nothing is finer than the manly concern of the captains who as they are supposed more sensible of glory than the soldiers take no share in their diversions but wander sorrowfully round the camp and lament their being kept from the battle this difference betwixt the soldiers and the leaders as dacier observes is a decorum of the highest beauty milton has admirably imitated this in the description he gives in his second book of the diversions of the angels during the absence of lucifer part on the plain or in the air sublime upon the wing or in swift race contend part curb their fiery steeds or shun the goal with rapid wheels or fronted brigades form but how nobly and judiciously has he raised the image in proportion to the nature of those more exalted beings in that which follows others with vast typhoean rage more fell rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air in whirlwind hell scarce holds the wild uproar   xxxvi verse   0 as when angry jove the comparison preceding this of a fire which runs through the corn and blazes to heaven had expressed at once the dazzling of their arms and the swiftness of their march after which homer having mentioned the sound of their feet superadds another simile which comprehends both the ideas of the brightness and the noise for here says eustathius the earth appears to burn and groan at the same time indeed the first of these similes is so full and so noble that it scarce seemed possible to be exceeded by any image drawn from nature but homer to raise it yet higher has gone into the mavelous given a prodigious and supernatural prospect and brought down jupiter himself arrayed in all his terrors to discharge his lightnings and thunders on typhoeus the poet breaks out into this description with an air of enthusiasm which greatly heightens the image in general while it seems to transport him beyond the limits of an exact comparison and this daring manner is particular to our author above all the ancients and to milton above all the moderns  xxxvii verse  0   from practius stream percote s pasture lands homer does not expressly mention practius as a river but strabo lib    tells us it is to be understood so in this passage the appellative of pasture lands to percote is justified in the    th iliad     where hicetaon is said to feed his oxen in that place  xxxviii verse  0   axius that swells with all his neighboring rills according to the common reading this verse should be translated axius that diffuses his beautiful waters over the land but we are assured by strabo that axius was a muddy river and that the ancients understood it thus axius that receives into it several beautiful rivers the criticism lies in the last word of the verse  which strabo reads  and interprets of the river aea whose waters were poured into axius however homer describes this river agreeable to the vulgar reading in il         this version takes in both  observations on the catalogue if we look upon this piece with an eye to ancient learning it may be observed that however fabulous the other parts of homers poem may be according to the nature of epic poetry this account of the people princes and countries is purely historical founded on the real transactions of those times and by far the most valuable piece of history and geography left us concerning the state of greece in that early period greece was then divided into several dynasties which our author has enumerated under their respective princes and his division was looked upon so exact that we are told of many controversies concerning the boundaries of grecian cities which have been decided upon the authority of this piece eustathius has collected together the following instances the city of calydon was adjudgd to the aetolians notwithstanding the pretensions of aeolia because homer had ranked it among the towns belonging to the former sestos was given to those of abydos upon the plea that he had said the abydonians were possessors of sestos abydos and arisbe when the milesians and people of priene disputed their claim to mycale a verse of homer carried it in favor of the milesians and the athenians were put in possession of salamis by another which was cited by solon or as some think interpolated by him for that purpose nay in so high estimation has this catalogue been held that as porphyry has written there have been laws in some nations for the youth to learn it by heart and particularly cerdias whom cuperus de apoth homer takes to be cercydas a lawgiver of the megalopolitans made it one to his countrymen  but if we consider the catalogue purely as poetical it will not want its beauties in that light rapin who was none of the most superstitious admirers of our author reckons it among those parts which had particularly charmed him we may observe first what an air of probability is spread over the whole poem by the particularizing of every nation and people concerned in this war secondly what an entertaining scene he presents to us of so many countries drawn in their liveliest and most natural colors while we wander along with him amidst a beautiful variety of towns havens forests vineyards groves mountains and rivers and are perpetually amused with his observations on the different soils products situations or prospects thirdly what a noble review he passes before us of so mighty an army drawn out in order troop by troop which had the number only been told in the gross had never filled the reader with so great a notion of the importance of the action fourthly the description of the differing arms and manner of fighting of the soldiers and the various attitudes he had given to the commanders of these leaders the greatest part are either the immediate sons of gods or the descendants of gods and how great an idea must we have of a war to the waging of which so many demigods and heroes are assembled fifthly the several artful compliments he paid by this means to his own country in general and many of his contemporaries in particular by a celebration of the genealogies ancient seats and dominions of the great men of his time sixthly the agreeable mixture of narrations from passages of history or fables with which he amuses and relieves us at proper intervals and lastly the admirable judgment wherewith he introduces this whole catalogue just at a time when the posture of affairs in the army rendered such a review of absolute necessity to the greeks and in a pause of action while each was refreshing himself to prepare for the ensuing battles  macrobius in his saturnalia lib   cap    has given us a judicious piece of criticism in the comparison betwixt the catalogues of homer and of virgil in which he justly allows the preference to our author for the following reasons homer says he has begun his description from the most noted promontory of greece he means that of aulis where was the narrowest passage to euboea from thence with a regular progress he describes either the maritime or mediterranean towns as their situations are contiguous he never passes with sudden leaps from place to place omitting those which lie between but proceeding like a traveller in the way he has begun constantly returns to the place from whence he digressd till he finishes the whole circle he designed virgil on the contrary has observed no order in the regions described in his catalogue l  0 but is perpetually breaking from the course of the country in a loose and desultory manner you have clusium and cosae at the beginning next populonia and ilva then pisae which lie at a vast distance in etruria and immediately after cerete pyrgi and graviscae places adjacent to rome from hence he is snatched to liguria then to mantua the same negligence is observable in his enumeration of the aids that followed turnus in l   macrobius next remarks that whatever persons are named by homer in his catalogue are afterward introduced in his battles and whenever any others are killed he mentions only a multitude in general whereas virgil he continues has spared himself the labor of that exactness for not only several whom he mentions in the list are never heard of in the war but others make a figure in the war of whom we had no notice in the list for example he specifies a thousand men under massicus who came from clusium l  0     turnus soon afterward is in the ship which had carried king osinius from the same place l  0     this osinius was never named before nor is it probable a king should serve under massicus nor indeed does either massicus or osinius ever make their appearance in the battles  he proceeds to instance several others who though celebrated for heroes in the catalogue have no farther notice taken of them throughout the poem in the third place he animadverts upon the confusion of the same names in virgil as where corinaeus in the ninth book is killed by asylas     and corinaeus in the twelfth kills ebusus     numa is slain by nisus l       and aeneas is afterward in pursuit of numa l  0     aeneas kills camertes in the tenth book     and juturna assumes his shape in the twelfth     he observes the same obscurity in his patronymics there is palinurus iasides and iapix iasides hippocoon hyrtacides and asylas hyrtacides on the contrary the caution of homer is remarkable who having two of the name of ajax is constantly careful to distinguish them by oileus or telamonius the lesser or the greater ajax  i know nothing to be alleged in defense of virgil in answer to this author but the common excuse that his aeneis was left unfinished and upon the whole these are such trivial slips as great wits may pass over and little critics rejoice at  but macrobius has another remark which one may accuse of evident partiality on the side of homer he blames virgil for having varied the expression in his catalogue to avoid the repetition of the same words and prefers the bare and unadorned reiterations of homer who begins almost every article the same way and ends perpetually  etc perhaps the best reason to be given for this had been the artless manner of the first times when such repetitions were not thought ungraceful this may appear from several of the like nature in the scripture as in the twenty sixth chapter of numbers where the tribes of israel are enumerated in the plains of moab and each division recounted in the same words so in the seventh chapter of the revelations of the tribe of gad were sealed twelve thousand etc but the words of macrobius are has copias fortasse putat aliquis divinae illi simplicitati praeferendas sed nescio quo modo homerum repetitio illa unice decet and est genio antiqui poetae digna this is exactly in the spirit and almost in the cant of a true modern critic the simplicitas the nescio quo modo the genio antiqui poetae digna are excellent general phrases for those who have no reasons simplicity is our word of disguise for a shameful unpoetical neglect of expression the term of the je ne scay quoy is the very support of all ignorant pretenders to delicacy and to lift up our eyes and talk of the genius of an ancient is at once the cheapest way of showing our own taste and the shortest way of criticizing the wit of others our contemporaries  one may add to the foregoing comparison of these two authors some reasons for the length of homers and the shortness of virgils catalogues as that homer might have a design to settle the geography of his country there being no description of greece before his days which was not the case with virgil homers concern was to compliment greece at a time when it was divided into many distinct states each of which might expect a place in his catalogue but when all italy was swallowed up in the sole dominion of rome virgil had only rome to celebrate homer had a numerous army and was to describe an important war with great and various events whereas virgils sphere was much more confined the ships of the greeks are computed at about one thousand two hundred those of aeneas and his aids but at two and forty and as the time of the action of both poems is the same we may suppose the built of their ships and the number of men they contained to be much alike so that if the army of homer amounts to about a hundred thousand men that of virgil cannot be above four thousand if any one be farther curious to know upon what this computation is founded he may see it in the following passage of thucidydes lib    homers fleet says he consisted of one thousand two hundred vessels those of the boeotians carried one hundred and twenty men in each and those of philoctetes fifty by these i suppose homer expressed the largest and the smallest size of ships and therefore mentions no other sort but he tells us of those who sailed with philoctetes that they served both as mariners and soldiers in saying the rowers were all of them archers from hence the whole number will be seen if we estimate the ships at a medium between the greatest and the least that is to say at eighty five men to each vessel which is the mean between fifty and a hundred and twenty the total comes to a hundred and two thousand men plutarch was therefore in a mistake when he computed the men at a hundred and twenty thousand which proceeded from his supposing a hundred and twenty in every ship the contrary to which appears from the abovementioned ships of philoctetes as well as from those of achilles which are said to carry but fifty men apiece in the sixteenth iliad      besides virgils imitation of this catalogue there has scarce been any epic writer but has copied after it which is at least a proof how beautiful this part has been ever esteemed by the finest geniuss in all ages the catalogues in the ancient poets are generally known only i must take notice that the phocian and boeotian towns in the fourth thebaid of statius are translated from hence of the moderns those which most excel owe their beauty to the imitation of some single particular only of homer thus the chief grace of tassos catalogue consists in the description of the heroes without any thing remarkable on the side of the countries of the pieces of story he has interwoven that of tancreds amor to clorinda is ill placed and evidently too long for the rest spencers enumeration of the british and irish rivers in the eleventh canto of his fourth book is one of the noblest in the world if we consider his subject was more confined and can excuse his not observing the order or course of the country but his variety of description and fruitfulness of imagination are no where more admirable than in that part miltons list of the fallen angels in his first book is an exact imitation of homer as far as regards the digressions of history and antiquities and his manner of inserting them in all else i believe it must be allowed inferior and indeed what macrobius has said to cast virgil below homer will fall much more strongly upon all the rest  i had some cause to fear that this catalogue which contributed so much to the success of the author should ruin that of the translator a mere heap of proper names though but for a few lines together could afford little entertainment to an english reader who probably could not be apprizd either of the necessity or beauty of this part of the poem there were but two things to be done to give it a chance to please him to render the versification very flowing and musical and to make the whole appear as much a landscape or piece of painting as possible for both of these i had the example of homer in general and virgil who found the necessity in another age to give more into description seemed to authorize the latter in particular dionysius of halicarnassus in his discourse of the structure and disposition of words professes to admire nothing more than that harmonious exactness with which homer has placed these words and softened the syllables into each other so as to derive music from a crowd of names which have in themselves no beauty or dignity i would flatter my self that i have practiced this not unsuccessfully in our language which is more susceptible of all the variety and power of numbers than any of the modern and second to none but the greek and roman for the latter point i have ventured to open the prospect a little by the addition of a few epithets or short hints of description to some of the places mentioned though seldom exceeding the compass of half a verse the space to which my author himself generally confines these pictures in miniature but this has never been done without the best authorities from the ancients which may be seen under the respective names in the geographical table following  the table itself i thought but necessary to annex to the map as my warrant for the situations assigned in it to several of the towns for in whatever maps i have seen to this purpose many of the places are omitted or else set down at random sophianus and gerbelius have labored to settle the geography of old greece many of whose mistakes were rectified by laurenbergius these however deserved a greater commendation than those who succeeded them and particularly sansons map prefixed to du pins bibliotheque historique is miserably defective both in omissions and false placings which i am obliged to mention as it pretends to be designed expressly for this catalogue of homer i am persuaded the greater part of my readers will have no curiosity this way however they may allow me the endeavor of gratifying those few who have the rest are at liberty to pass the two or three following leaves unread  a geographical table of the towns etc in homers catalogue of greece

twentieth day still continues throughout this book the scene is sometimes in the fields before troy and sometimes in troy itself  the third book of the iliad thus by their leaders care each martial band moves into ranks and stretches over the land with shouts the trojans rushing from afar proclaim their motions and provoke the war so when inclement winters vex the plain with piercing frosts or thickdescending rain to warmer seas the cranes embodied fly with noise and order through the midway sky to pygmynations wounds and death they bring and all the war descends upon the wing but silent breathing rage resolved and skilled by mutual aids to fix a doubtful field swift march the greeks the rapid dust around darkning arises from the labored ground thus from his flaggy wings when notus sheds a night of vapors round the mountainheads swiftgliding mists the dusky fields invade to thieves more grateful than the midnight shade while scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey lost and confused amidst the thickened day so wrapped in gathering dust the grecian train a moving cloud swept on and hid the plain now front to front the hostile armies stand eager of fight and only wait command when to the van before the sons of fame whom troy sent forth the beauteous paris came in form a god the panthers speckled hyde flowed over his armor with an easy pride his bended bow across his shoulders flung his sword beside him negligently hung two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace and dared the bravest of the grecian race as thus with glorious air and proud disdain he boldly stalked the foremost on the plain him menelaus loved of mars espies with heart elated and with joyful eyes so joys a lion if the branching deer or mountain goat his bulky prize appear in vain the youths oppose the mastives bay the lordly savage rends the panting prey thus fond of vengeance with a furious bound in clanging arms he leaps upon the ground from his high chariot him approaching near the beauteous champion views with marks of fear smit with a conscious sense retires behind and shuns the fate he well deserved to find as when some shepherd from the rustling trees shot forth to view a scaly serpent sees trembling and pale he starts with wild affright and all confused precipitates his flight so from the king the shining warrior flies and plunged amid the thickest trojans lies as godlike hector sees the prince retreat he thus upbraids him with a generous heat unhappy paris but to women brave so fairly formed and only to deceive oh had thou died when first thou saw the light or died at least before thy nuptial rite a better fate than vainly thus to boast and fly the scandal of thy trojan host gods how the scornful greeks exult to see their fears of danger undeceived in thee thy figure promised with a martial air but ill thy soul supplies a form so fair in former days in all thy gallant pride when thy tall ships triumphant stemd the tide when greece beheld thy painted canvas flow and crowds stood wondering at the passing show say was it thus with such a baffled mien you met the approaches of the spartan queen thus from her realm conveyed the beauteous prize and theseus and menelaus both her warlike lords outshind in helens eyes this deed thy foes delight thy own disgrace thy fathers grief and ruin of thy race this deed recalls thee to the proffered fight or have thou injured whom thou dare not right soon to thy cost the field would make thee know thou keepst the consort of a braver foe thy graceful form instilling soft desire thy curling tresses and thy silver lyre beauty and youth in vain to these you trust when youth and beauty shall be laid in dust troy yet may wake and one avenging blow crush the dire author of his countrys woe his silence here with blushes paris breaks it is just my brother what your anger speaks but who like thee can boast a soul sedate so firmly proof to all the shocks of fate thy force like steel a tempered hardness shows still edged to wound and still untird with blows like steel uplifted by some strenuous swain with falling woods to strew the wasted plain thy gifts i praise nor thou despise the charms with which a lover golden venus arms soft moving speech and pleasing outward show no wish can gain em but the gods bestow yet woudst thou have the proffered combat stand the greeks and trojans seat on either hand then let a midway space our hosts divide and on that stage of war the cause be tried by paris there the spartan king be fought for beauteous helen and the wealth she brought and who his rival can in arms subdue his be the fair and his the treasure too thus with a lasting league your toils may cease and troy possess her fertile fields in peace thus may the greeks review their native shore much famed for generous steeds for beauty more he said the challenge hector heard with joy then with his spear restrained the youth of troy held by the midst athwart and near the foe advanced with steps majestically slow while round his dauntless head the grecians pour their stones and arrows in a mingled shower then thus the monarch great atrides cried forbear ye warriors lay the darts aside a parley hector asks a message bears we know him by the various plume he wears awed by his high command the greeks attend the tumult silence and the fight suspend while from the center hector rolls his eyes on either host and thus to both applies hear all ye trojans all ye grecian bands what paris author of the war demands your shining swords within the sheath restrain and pitch your lances in the yielding plain here in the midst in either armys sight he dares the spartan king to single fight and wills that helen and the ravished spoil that caused the contest shall reward the toil

around whose brow such martial graces shine so tall so awful and almost divine though some of larger stature tread the green none match his grandeur and exalted mien he seems a monarch and his countrys pride thus ceased the king and thus the fair replied before thy presence father i appear with conscious shame and reverential fear ah had i died ere to these walls i fled false to my country and my nuptial bed my brothers friends and daughter left behind false to them all to paris only kind for this i mourn till grief or dire disease shall waste the form whose crime it was to please the king of kings atrides you survey great in the war and great in arts of sway my brother once before my days of shame and oh that still he bore a brothers name with wonder priam viewed the godlike man extolled the happy prince and thus began o blessed atrides born to prosperous fate successful monarch of a mighty state how vast thy empire of yon matchless train what numbers lost what numbers yet remain in phrygia once were gallant armies known in ancient time when otreus filled the throne when godlike mygdon led their troops of horse and i to join them raised the trojan force against the manlike amazons we stood and sangars stream ran purple with their blood but far inferior those in manly grace and strength of numbers to this grecian race this said once more he viewed the martial train what is he whose arms lie scattered on the plain broad is his breast his shoulders larger spread though great atrides overtops his head nor yet appear his care and conduct small from rank to rank he moves and orders all the stately ram thus measures over the ground and master of the flocks surveys them round then helen thus whom your discerning eyes have singled out is ithacus the wife a barren island boasts his glorious birth his fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth antenor took the word and thus began my self o king have seen that wondrous man when trusting jove and hospitable laws to troy he came to plead the grecian cause great menelaus urged the same request my house was honored with each royal guest i knew their persons and admired their parts both brave in arms and both approved in arts erect the spartan most engaged our view ulysses seated greater reverence drew when atreus son harangud the listening train just was his sense and his expression plain his words succinct yet full without a fault he spoke no more than just the thing he ought but when ulysses rose in thought profound his modest eyes he fixed upon the ground as one unskilled or dumb he seemed to stand nor raised his head nor stretched his sceptred hand but when he speaks what elocution flows soft as the fleeces of descending snows the copious accents fall with easy art melting they fall and sink into the heart wondering we hear and fixed in deep surprise our ears refute the censure of our eyes the king then asked as yet the camp he viewed what chief is that with giant strength endud whose brawny shoulders and whose swelling chest and lofty stature far exceed the rest ajax the great the beauteous queen replied himself an host the grecian strength and pride see bold idomeneus superior towers amidst yon circle of his cretan powers great as a god i saw him once before with menelaus on the spartan shore the rest i know and could in order name all valiant chiefs and men of mighty fame yet two are wanting of the numerous train whom long my eyes have sought but sought in vain castor and pollux first in martial force one bold on foot and one renowned for horse my brothers these the same our native shore one house contained us as one mother bore perhaps the chiefs from warlike toils at ease for distant troy refused to sail the seas perhaps their sword some nobler quarrel draws ashamed to combat in their sisters cause so spoke the fair nor knew her brothers doom wrapped in the cold embraces of the tomb adorned with honors in their native shore silent they slept and heard of wars no more meantime the heralds through the crowded town bring the rich wine and destined victims down idaeus arms the golden goblets pressed who thus the venerable king addressed arise o father of the trojan state the nations call thy joyful people wait to seal the truce and end the dire debate paris thy son and spartas king advance in measured lists to toss the weighty lance and who his rival shall in arms subdue his be the dame and his the treasure too thus with a lasting league our toils may cease and troy possess her fertile fields in peace so shall the greeks review their native shore much famed for generous steeds for beauty more with grief he heard and bade the chiefs prepare to join his milkwhite coursers to the car he mounts the seat antenor at his side the gentle steeds through scaeas gates they guide next from the car descending on the plain amid the grecian host and trojan train slow they proceed the sage ulysses then arose and with him rose the king of men on either side a sacred herald stands the wine they mix and on each monarchs hands pour the full urn then drew the grecian lord his cutlace sheathed beside his pondrous sword from the signed victims crops the curling hair the heralds part it and the princes share then loudly thus before the attentive bands he calls the gods and spreads his lifted hands o first and greatest power whom all obey who high on idas holy mountain sway eternal jove and you bright orb that roll from east to west and view from pole to pole thou mother earth and all ye living floods infernal furies and tartarean gods who rule the dead and horrid woes prepare for perjured kings and all who falsely swear hear and be witness if by paris slain great menelaus press the fatal plain the dame and treasures let the trojan keep and greece returning plow the watery deep if by my brothers lance the trojan bleed be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed the appointed fine let ilion justly pay and every age record the signal day this if the phrygians shall refuse to yield arms must revenge and mars decide the field with that the chief the tender victims slew and in the dust their bleeding bodies threw the vital spirit issued at the wound and left the members quivering on the ground from the same urn they drink the mingled wine and add libations to the powers divine while thus their prayers united mount the sky hear mighty jove and hear ye gods on high and may their blood who first the league confound shed like this wine distain the thirsty ground may all their consorts serve promiscuous lust and all their race be scattered as the dust thus either host their imprecations joined which jove refused and mingled with the wind the rites now finished reverend priam rose and thus expressed a heart oerchargd with woes ye greeks and trojans let the chiefs engage but spare the weakness of my feeble age in yonder walls that object let me shun nor view the danger of so dear a son whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall heaven only knows for heaven disposes all this said the hoary king no longer stayed but on his car the slaughtered victims laid then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide and drove to troy antenor at his side bold hector and ulysses now dispose the lists of combat and the ground enclose next to decide by sacred lots prepare who first shall lance his pointed spear in air the people pray with elevated hands and words like these are heard through all the bands immortal jove high heavens superior lord on lofty idas holy mount adored whoever involved us in this dire debate oh give that author of the war to fate and shades eternal let division cease and joyful nations join in leagues of peace with eyes averted hector hasts to turn the lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn then paris thine leaped forth by fatal chance ordained the first to whirl the weighty lance both armies sat the combat to survey beside each chief his azure armor lay and round the lists the generous coursers neigh the beauteous warrior now arrays for fight in gilded arms magnificently bright the purple cuishes clasp his thighs around with flowers adorned and silver buckles bound lycaons corslet his fair body dressed braced in and fitted to his softer breast a radiant baldric over his shoulder tied sustains the sword that glitters at his side his youthful face a polished helm overspread the waving horsehair nodded on his head his figured shield a shining orb he takes and in his hand a pointed javelin shakes with equal speed and fired by equal charms the spartan hero sheaths his limbs in arms now round the lists the admiring armies stand with javlins fixed the greek and trojan band amidst the dreadful vale the chiefs advance all pale with rage and shake the threatening lance the trojan first his shining javelin threw full on atrides ringing shield it flew nor pierced the brazen orb but with a bound leaped from the buckler blunted on the ground atrides then his massy lance prepares in act to throw but first prefers his prayers give me great jove to punish lawless lust and lay the trojan gasping in the dust destroy the aggressor aid my righteous cause avenge the breach of hospitable laws let this example future times reclaim and guard from wrong fair friendships holy name he said and poised in air the javelin sent through paris shield the forceful weapon went his corslet pierces and his garment rends and glancing downward near his flank descends the wary trojan bending from the blow eludes his death and disappoints the foe but fierce atrides waved his sword and struck full on his casque the crested helmet shook the brittle steel unfaithful to his hand broke short the fragments glittered on the sand the raging warrior to the spacious skies raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes then is it vain in jove himself to trust and is it thus the gods assist the just when crimes provoke us heaven success denies the dart falls harmless and the faulchion flies furious he said and towered the grecian crew seized by the crest the unhappy warrior drew struggling he followed while the embroidered thong that tied his helmet dragged the chief along then had his ruin crowned atrides joy but venus trembled for the price of troy unseen she came and burst the golden band and left an empty helmet in his hand the casque enraged amidst the greeks he threw the greeks with smiles the polished trophy view then as once more he lifts the deadly dart in thirst of vengeance at his rivals heart the queen of love her favored champion shrouds for gods can all things in a veil of clouds raised from the field the panting youth she led and gently laid him on the bridal bed with pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews and all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews meantime the brightest of the female kind the matchless helen over the walls reclined to her beset with trojan beauties came in groeas form the venus laughterloving dame  groea her favorite maid wellskilld to cull the snowie fleece and wind the twisted wool the goddess softly shook her silken vest that shed perfumes and whispering thus addressed haste happy nymph for thee thy paris calls safe from the fight in yonder lofty walls fair as a god with odours round him spread he lies and waits thee on the wellknown bed not like a warrior parted from the foe but some gay dancer in the public show she spoke and helens secret soul was moved she scorned the champion but the man she loved fair venus neck her eyes that sparkled fire and breast revealed the queen of soft desire struck with her presence strait the lively red forsook her cheek and trembling thus she said then is it still thy pleasure to deceive and womans frailty always to believe say to new nations must i cross the main or carry wars to some soft asian plain for whom must helen break her second vow what other paris is thy darling now left to atrides victor in the strife an odious conquest and a captive wife hence let me sail and if thy paris bear my absence ill let venus ease his care a handmaid goddess at his side to wait renounce the glories of thy heavenly state be fixed for ever to the trojan shore his spouse or slave and mount the skies no more for me to lawless love no longer led i scorn the coward and detest his bed else should i merit everlasting shame and keen reproach from every phrygian dame ill suits it now the joys of love to know too deep my anguish and too wild my woe then thus incensed the paphian queen replies obey the power from whom thy glories rise should venus leave thee every charm must fly fade from thy cheek and languish in thy eye cease to provoke me lest i make thee more the worlds aversion than their love before now the bright prize for which mankind engage then the sad victim of the public rage at this the fairest of her sex obeyed and veiled her blushes in a silken shade unseen and silent from the train she moves led by the goddess of the smiles and loves arrived and entered at the palace gate the maids officious round their mistress wait then all dispersing various tasks attend the queen and goddess to the prince ascend full in her paris sight the queen of love had placed the beauteous progeny of jove where as he viewed her charms she turned away her glowing eyes and thus began to say is this the chief who lost to sense of shame late fled the field and yet survives his fame oh had thou died beneath the righteous sword of that brave man whom once i called my lord the boaster paris often desired the day with spartas king to meet in single fray go now once more thy rivals rage excite provoke atrides and renew the fight yet helen bids thee stay lest thou unskilled should fall an easy conquest on the field the prince replies ah cease divinely fair nor add reproaches to the wounds i bear this day the foe prevailed by pallas power we yet may vanquish in a happier hour there want not gods to favor us above but let the business of our life be love these softer moments let delights employ and kind embraces snatch the hasty joy not thus i loved thee when from spartas shore my forced my willing heavenly prize i bore when first entranced in cranaes isle i lay mixed with thy soul and all dissolved away thus having spoke the enamored phrygian boy rushed to the bed impatient for the joy him helen followed slow with bashful charms and clasped the blooming hero in her arms while these to loves delicious rapture yield the stern atrides rages round the field so some fell lion whom the woods obey roars through the desert and demands his prey paris he seeks impatient to destroy but seeks in vain along the troops of troy even those had yielded to a foe so brave the recreant warrior hateful as the grave then speaking thus the king of kings arose ye trojans dardans all our generous foes hear and attest from heaven with conquest crowned our brothers arms the just success have found be therefore now the spartan wealth restored let argive helen own her lawful lord the appointed fine let ilion justly pay and age to age record this signal day he ceased his armys just applauses rise and the long shout runs ecchoing through the skies observations on the third book observations on the third book of all the books of the iliad there is scarce any more pleasing than the third it may be divided into five parts each of which has a beauty different from the other the first contains what passed before the two armies and the proposal of the combat between paris and menelaus the attention and suspense of these mighty hosts which were just upon the point of joining battle and the lofty manner of offering and accepting this important and unexpected challenge have something in them wonderfully pompous and of an amusing solemnity the second part which describes the behavior of helena in this juncture her conference with the old king and his counselors with the review of the heroes from the battelments is an episode entirely of another sort which excels in the natural and pathetick the third consists of the ceremonies of the oath on both sides and the preliminaries to the combat with the beautiful retreat of priam who in the tenderness of a parent withdraws from the sight of the duel these particulars detain the reader in expectation and heighten his impatience for the fight itself the fourth is the description of the duel an exact piece of painting where we see every attitude motion and action of the combatants particularly and distinctly and which concludes with a surprising propriety in the rescue of paris by venus the machine of that goddess which makes the fifth part and whose end is to reconcile paris and helena is admirable in every circumstance the remonstrance she holds with the goddess the reluctance with which she obeys her the reproaches she casts upon paris and the flattery and courtship with which he so soon wins her over to him helen the main cause of this war was not to be made an odious character she is drawn by this great master with the finest strokes as a frail but not an abandoned creature she has perpetual struggles of virtue on the one side and softnesses which overcome them on the other our author has been remarkably careful to tell us this whenever he but slightly names her in the foregoing part of his work she is represented at the same time as repentant and it is thus we see her at large at her first appearance in the present book which is one of the shortest of the whole iliad but in recompense has beauties almost in every line and most of them so obvious that to acknowledge them we need only to read them  i verse   with shouts the trojans the book begins with a fine opposition of the noise of the trojan army to the silence of the graecians it was but natural to imagine this since the former was composed of many different nations of various languages and strangers to each other the latter were more united in their neighborhood and under leaders of the same country but as this observation seems particularly insisted upon by our author for he uses it again in the fourth book   0 so he had a farther reason for it plutarch in his treatise of reading the poets remarks upon this distinction as a particular credit to the military discipline of the greeks and several ancient authors tell us it was the manner of the barbarians to encounter with shouts and outcries as it continues to this day the custom of the eastern nations perhaps these clamours were only to encourage their men instead of martial instruments i think sir walter raleigh says there never was a people but made use of some sort of music in battle homer never mentions any in the greek or trojan armies and it is scarce to be imagined he would omit a circumstance so poetical without some particular reason the verb  which the modern greeks have since appropriated to the sound of a trumpet is used indifferently in our author for other sounds as for thunder in the the    st iliad       he once names the trumpet  in a simile upon which eustathius and didymus observe that the use of it was known in the poets time but not in that of the trojan war and hence we may infer that homer was particularly careful not to confound the manners of the times he wrote of with those of the times he lived in  ii verse   the cranes embodied fly if wit has been truly described to be a similitude in ideas and is more excellent as that similitude is more surprising there cannot be a truer kind of wit than what is shown in apt comparisons especially when composed of such subjects as having the least relation to each other in general have yet some particular that agrees exactly of this nature is the simile of the cranes to the trojan army where the fancy of homer flew to the remotest part of the world for an image which no reader could have expected but it is no less exact than surprising the likeness consists in two points the noise and the order the latter is so observable as to have given some of the ancients occasion to imagine the embatteling of an army was first learned from the close manner of flight of these birds but this part of the simile not being directly expressed by the author has been overlooked by some of the commentators it may be remarked that homer has generally a wonderful closeness in all the particulars of his comparisons notwithstanding he takes a liberty in his expression of them he seems so secure of the main likeness that he makes no scruple to play with the circumstances sometimes by transposing the order of them sometimes by superadding them and sometimes as in this place by neglecting them in such a manner as to leave the reader to supply them himself for the present comparison it has been taken by virgil in the tenth book and applied to the clamours of soldiers in the same manner  quales sub nubibus atris strymoniae dant signa grues atque aethera tranant cum sonitu fugiuntque notos clamore secundo   iii verse    the beauteous paris came in form a god this is meant by the epithet  as has been said in the    th note on the first book the picture here given of pariss air and dress is exactly correspondent to his character you see him endeavoring to mix the fine gentleman with the warrior and this idea of him homer takes care to keep up by describing him not without the same regard when he is arming to encounter menelaus afterward in a close fight as he shows here where he is but preluding and flourishing in the gaiety of his heart and when he tells us in that place that he was in danger of being strangled by the strap of his helmet he takes notice that it was  embroidered  iv verse    so joys a lion if the branching deer or mountain goat the old scholiasts refining on this simile will have it that paris is compared to a goat on account of his incontinence and to a stag for his cowardice to this last they make an addition which is very ludicrous that he is also likend to a deer for his skill in music and cite aristotle to prove that animal delights in harmony which opinion is alluded to by mr waller in these lines here love takes stand and while she charms the ear empties his quiver on the listening deer but upon the whole it is whimsical to imagine this comparison consists in any thing more than the joy which menelaus conceived at the sight of his rival in the hopes of destroying him it is equally an injustice to paris to abuse him for understanding music and to represent his retreat as purely the effect of fear which proceeded from his sense of guilt with respect to the particular person of menelaus he appeared at the head of the army to challenge the boldest of the enemy nor is his character elsewhere in the iliad by any means that of a coward hector at the end of the sixth book confesses that no man could justly reproach him as such nor is he represented so by ovid who copied homer very closely in the end of his epistle to helen the moral of homer is much finer a brave mind however blinded with passion is sensible of remorse as soon as the injured object presents itself and paris never behaves himself ill in war but when his spirits are depressed by the consciousness of an injustice this also will account for the seeming incongruity of homer in this passage who as they would have us think paints him a shameful coward at the same time that he is perpetually calling him the divine paris and paris like a god what he says immediately afterward in answer to hectors reproof will make this yet more clear  v verse    as when a shepherd this comparison of the serpent is finely imitated by virgil in the second aeneid improvisum aspris veluti qui sentibus anguem pressit humi nitens trepidusque repent refugit attollentem iras and caerula colla tumentem haud secus androgeus visu tremefaclus abibat   but it may be said to the praise of virgil that he has applied it upon an occasion where it has an additional beauty paris upon the sight of menelauss approach is compared to a traveller who sees a snake shoot on a sudden toward him but the surprise and danger of androgeus is more lively being just in the reach of his enemies before he perceived it and the circumstance of the serpents rouzing his crest which brightens with anger finely images the shining of their arms in the nightime as they were just lifted up to destroy him scaliger criticizes on the needless repetition in the words  and  which is avoided in the translation but it must be observed in general that little exactnesses are what we should not look for in homer the genius of his age was too incorrect and his own too fiery to regard them  vi verse    as godlike hector this is the first place of the poem where hector makes a figure and here it seems proper to give an idea of his character since if he is not the chief hero of the iliad he is at least the most amiable there are several reasons which render hector a favorite character with every reader some of which shall here be offered the chief moral of homer was to expose the ill effects of discord the greeks were to be shown disunited and to render that disunion the more probable he has designedly given them mixed characters the trojans on the other hand were to be represented making all advantages of the others disagreement which they could not do without a strict union among themselves hector therefore who commanded them must be endud with all such qualifications as tended to the preservation of it as achilles with such as promoted the contrary the one stands in contraste to the other an accomplished character of valor unruffled by rage and anger and uniting his people by his prudence and example hector has also a foil to set him off in his own family we are perpetually opposing in our minds the incontinence of paris who exposes his country to the temperance of hector who protects it and indeed it is this love of his country which appears his principal passion and the motive of all his actions he has no other blemish than that he fights in an unjust cause which homer has yet been careful to tell us he would not do if his opinion were followed but since he cannot prevail the affection he bears to his parents and kindred and his desire of defending them incites him to do his utmost for their safety we may add that homer having so many greeks to celebrate makes them shine in their turns and singly in their several books one succeeding in the absence of another whereas hector appears in every battle the life and soul of his party and the constant bulwark against every enemy he stands against agamemnons magnanimity diomeds bravery ajaxs strength and achilless fury there is besides an accidental cause for our liking him from reading the writers of the augustan age especially virgil whose favorite he grew more particularly from the time when the caesars fancied to derive their pedigree from troy  vii verse    unhappy paris etc it may be observed in honor of homers judgment that the words which hector is made to speak here very strongly mark his character they contain a warm reproach of cowardice and show him to be touched with so high a sense of glory as to think life insupportable without it his calling to mind the gallant figure which paris had made in his amors to helen and opposing to it the image of his flight from her husband is a sarcasm of the utmost bitterness and vivacity after he has named that action of the rape the cause of so many mischiefs his insisting upon it in so many broken periods those disjointed shortnesses of speech   that hasty manner of expression without the connection of particles is as eustathius remarks extremely natural to a man in anger who thinks he can never vent himself too soon that contempt of outward show of the gracefulness of person and of the accomplishments of a courtly life is what corresponds very well with the warlike temper of hector and these verses have therefore a beauty here which they want in horace however admirably he has translated them in the ode of nireuss prophecy nequicquam veneris praesidio ferox pectes caesariem grataque foeminis imbelli cithara carmina divides etc   viii verse    and both her warlike lords the original is  the spouse of martial men i wonder why madam dacier chose to turn it alliee a tant de braves guerriers since it so naturally refers to theseus and menelaus the former husbands of helena  ix verse  0 thy curling tresses and thy silver lyre it is ingeniously remarked by dacier that homer who celebrates the greeks for their long hair  and achilles for his skill on the harp makes hector in this place object them both to paris the greeks nourished their hair to appear more dreadful to the enemy and paris to please the eyes of women achilles sung to his harp the acts of heroes and paris the amors of lovers the same reason which makes hector here displeased at them made alexander afterward refuse to see this lyre of paris when offered to be shown to him as plutarch relates the story in his oration of the fortune of alexander  x verse    one avenging blow it is in the greek you had been clad in a coat of stone giphanius would have it to mean stoned to death on the account of his adultery but this does not appear to have been the punishment of that crime among the phrygians it seems rather to signify destroyed by the fury of the people for the war he had brought upon them or perhaps may imply no more than being laid in his grave under a monument of stones but the former being the stronger sense is here followed  xi verse    it is just my brother this speech is a farther opening of the true character of paris he is a master of civility no less wellbred to his own sex than courtly to the other the reproof of hector was of a severe nature yet he receives it as from a brother and a friend with candor and modesty this answer is remarkable for its fine address he gives the hero a decent and agreeable reproof for having too rashly depreciated the gifts of nature he allows the quality of courage its utmost due but desires the same justice to those softer accomplishments which he lets him know are no less the favor of heaven then he removes from himself the charge of want of valor by proposing the single combat with the very man he had just declined to engage which having shown him void of any malevolence to his rival on the one hand he now proves himself free from the imputation of cowardice on the other homer draws him as we have seen soft of speech the natural quality of an amorous temper vainly gay in war as well as love with a spirit that can be surprised and recollected that can receive impressions of shame or apprehension on the one side or of generosity and courage on the other the usual disposition of easy and courteous minds which are most subject to the rule of fancy and passion upon the whole this is no worse than the picture of a gentle knight and one might fancy the heroes of the modern romance were formed upon the model of paris  xii verse  0  much famed for generous steeds for beauty more the original is  perhaps this line is translated too close to the letter and the epithets might have been omitted but there are some traits and particularities of this nature which methinks preserve to the reader the air of homer at least the latter of these circumstances that greece was eminent for beautiful women seems not improper to be mentioned by him who had raised a war on the account of a grecian beauty  xiii verse  0  the challenge hector heard with joy hector stays not to reply to his brother but runs away with the challenge immediately he looks upon all the trojans as disgraced by the late flight of paris and thinks not a moment is to be lost to regain the honor of his country the activity he shows in all this affair wonderfully agrees with the spirit of a soldier  xiv verse     hear all ye trojan all ye grecian bands it has been asked how the different nations could understand one another in these conferences since we have no mention in homer of any interpreter between them he who was so very particular in the most minute points can hardly be thought to have been negligent in this some reasons may be offered that they both spoke the same language for the trojans as may be seen in dion halic lib   were of grecian extraction originally dardanus the first of their kings was born in arcadia and even their names were generally greek as hector anchises andromache astyanax etc of the last of these in particular homer gives us a derivation which is purely greek in il    0  but however it be this is no more as dacier somewhere observes than the just privilege of poetry aeneas and turnus understand each other in virgil and the language of the poet is supposed to be universally intelligible not only between different countries but between earth and heaven itself  xv verse     me too ye warriors hear etc we may observe what care homer takes to give every one his proper character and how this speech of menelaus is adapted to the laconick which the better to comprehend we may remember there are in homer three speakers of different characters agreeable to the three different kinds of eloquence these we may compare with each other in one instance supposing them all to use the same heads and in the same order  the materials of the speech are the manifesting his grief for the war with the hopes that it is in his power to end it an acceptance of the proposed challenge an account of the ceremonies to be used in the league and a proposal of a proper caution to secure it  now had nestor these materials to work upon he would probably have begun with a relation of all the troubles of the nine years siege which he hoped he might now bring to an end he would court their benevolence and good wishes for his prosperity with all the figures of amplification while he accepted the challenge he would have given an example to prove that the single combat was a wise gallant and gentle way of ending the war practiced by their fathers in the description of the rites he would be exceeding particular and when he chose to demand the sanction of priam rather than of his sons he would place in opposition on one side the sons action which began the war and on the other the impressions of concern or repentance which it must by this time have made in the fathers mind whose wisdom he would undoubtedly extol as the effect of his age all this he would have expatiated upon with connexions of the discourses in the most evident manner and the most easy gliding undisobliging transitions the effect would be that the people would hear him with pleasure  had it been ulysses who was to make the speech he would have mentioned a few of their most affecting calamities in a pathetick air then have undertaken the fight with testifying such a cheerful joy as should have won the hearts of the soldiers to follow him to the field without being desired he would have been exceeding cautious in wording the conditions and solemn rather than particular in speaking of the rites which he would only insist on as an opportunity to exhort both sides to a fear of the gods and a strict regard of justice he would have remonstrated the use of sending for priam and because no caution could be too much have demanded his sons to be bound with him for a conclusion he would have used some noble sentiment agreeable to a hero and it may be have enforced it with some inspirited action in all this you would have known that the discourse hung together but its fire would not always suffer it to be seen in cooler transitions which when they are too nicely laid open may conduct the reader but never carry him away the people would hear him with emotion  these materials being given to menelaus he but just mentions their troubles and his satisfaction in the prospect of ending them shortens the proposals says a sacrifice is necessary requires priams presence to confirm the conditions refuses his sons with a resentment of that injury he suffered by them and concludes with a reason for his choice from the praise of age with a short gravity and the air of an apothegm this he puts in order without any more transition than what a single conjunction affords and the effect of the discourse is that the people are instructed by it in what is to be done  xvi verse     two lambs devoted the trojans says the old scholiast were required to sacrifice two lambs one male of a white color to the sun and one female and black to the earth as the sun is father of light and the earth the mother and nurse of men the greeks were to offer a third to jupiter perhaps to jupiter xenius because the trojans had broken the laws of hospitality on which account we find menelaus afterward invoking him in the combat with paris that these were the powers to which they sacrificed appears by their being attested by name in the oath   0  xvii verse     the nations hear with rising hopes possessed it seemed no more than what the reader would reasonably expect in the narration of this long war that a period might have been put to it by the single danger of the parties chiefly concerned paris and menelaus homer has therefore taken care toward the beginning of his poem to obviate that objection and contrived such a method to render this combat of no effect as should naturally make way for all the ensuing battles without any future prospect of a determination but by the sword it is farther worth observing in what manner he has improved into poetry the common history of this action if as one may imagine it was the same with that we have in the second book of dictys cretensis when paris says he being wounded by the spear of menelaus fell to the ground just as his adversary was rushing upon him with his sword he was shot by an arrow from pandarus which prevented his revenge in the moment he was going to take it immediately on the sight of this perfidious action the greeks rose in a tumult the trojans rising at the same time came on and rescued paris from his enemy homer has with great art and invention mingled all this with the mavelous and raised it in the air of fable the goddess of love rescues her favorite jupiter debates whether or no the war shall end by the defeat of paris juno is for the continuance of it minerva incites pandarus to break the truce who thereupon shoots at menelaus this heightens the grandeur of the action without destroying the verisimilitude diversifies the poem and exhibits a fine moral that whatever seems in the world the effect of common causes is really owing to the decree and disposition of the gods  xviii verse     mean while to beauteous helen etc the following part where we have the first sight of helena is what i cannot think inferior to any in the poem the reader has naturally an aversion to this pernicious beauty and is apt enough to wonder at the greeks for endeavoring to recover her at such an expense but her amiable behavior here the secret wishes that rise in favor of her rightful lord her tenderness for her parents and relations the relentings of her soul for the mischiefs her beauty had been the cause of the confusion she appears in the veiling her face and dropping a tear are particulars so beautifully natural as to make every reader no less than menelaus himself inclined to forgive her at least if not to love her we are afterward confirmed in this partiality by the sentiment of the old counselors upon the sight of her which one would think homer put into their mouths with that very view we excuse her no more than priam does himself and all those do who felt the calamities she occasioned and this regard for her is heightened by all she says herself in which there is scarce a word that is not big with repentance and goodnature  xix verse   0 the golden web her own sad story crowned this is a very agreeable fiction to represent helena weaving in a large veil or piece of tapestry the story of the trojan war one would think that homer inherited this veil and that his iliad is only an explication of that admirable piece of art dacier  xx verse  0  like grasshoppers this is one of the justest and most natural images in the world though there have been critics of so little taste as to object to it as a mean one the garrulity so common to old men their delight in associating with each other the feeble sound of their voices the pleasure they take in a sunshiny day the effects of decay in their chillness leanness and scarcity of blood are all circumstances exactly paralleled in this comparison to make it yet more proper to the old men of troy faistathius has observed that homer found a hint for this simile in the trojan story where tithou was feigned to have been transformed into a grasshopper in his old age perhaps on account of his being so exhausted by years as to have nothing left him but voice spondanus wonders that homer should apply to grasshoppers  a sweet voice whereas that of these animals is harsh and untuneful and he is contented to come off with a very poor evasion of homero fingere quidlibet fas fuit but hesychius rightly observes that  signifies  tener or gracilis as well as suavis the sense is certainly much better and the simile more truly preserved by this interpretation which is here followed in translating it feeble however it may be alleged in defense of the common versions and of madam daciers who has turned it harmonieuse that though virgil gives the epithet raucae to cicadae yet the greek poets frequently describe the grasshopper as a musical creature particularly anacreon and theocritus idyl   where a shepherd praises anothers singing by telling him  it is remarkable that mr hobbes has omitted this beautiful simile  xxi verse  0  these when the spartan fair approached madam dacier is of opinion there was never a greater panegyric upon beauty than what homer has found the art to give it in this place an assembly of venerable old counselors who had suffered all the calamities of a tedious war and were consulting upon the methods to put a conclusion to it seeing the only cause of it approaching toward them are struck with her charms and cry out no wonder etc nevertheless they afterward recollect themselves and conclude to part with her for the public safety if homer had carried these old mens admiration any farther he had been guilty of outraging nature and offending against probability the old are capable of being touched with beauty by the eye but age secures them from the tyranny of passion and the effect is but transitory for prudence soon regains its dominion over them homer always goes as far as he should but constantly stops just where he ought dacier  the same writer compares to this the speech of holoserness soldiers on the sight of judith chapter  0    but though there be a resemblance in the words the beauty is no way parallel the grace of this consisting in the age and character of those who speak it there is something very gallant upon the beauty of helen in one of lucians dialogues mercury shows menippus the sculls of several fine women and when the philosopher is moralizing upon that of helen was it for this a thousand ships sailed from greece so many brave men died and so many cities were destroyed my friend says mercury it is true but what you behold is only her scull bad you seen her face you would have been of their opinion and have done the very same thing  xxii verse     the good old priam the character of a benevolent old man is very well preserved in priams behavior to helena upon the confusion he observes her in he encourages her by attributing the misfortunes of the war to the gods alone and not to her fault this sentiment is also very agreeable to the natural piety of old age those who have had the longest experience of human accidents and events being most inclined to ascribe the disposal of all things to the will of heaven it is this piety that renders priam a favorite of jupiter as we find in the beginning of the fourth book which for some time delays the destruction of troy while his soft nature and indulgence for his children makes him continue a war which ruins him these are the two principal points of priams character though there are several lesser particularities among which we may observe the curiosity and inquisitive humor of old age which gives occasion to the following episode  xxiii verse     and say what chief is he this view of the grecian leaders from the walls of troy is justly looked upon as an episode of great beauty as well as a masterpiece of conduct in homer who by this means acquaints the readers with the figure and qualifications of each hero in a more lively and agreeable manner several great poets have been engaged by the beauty of this passage to an imitation of it in the seventh book of statius phorbas standing with antigone on the tower of thebes shows her the forces as they were drawn up and describes their commanders who were neighboring princes of boeotia it is also imitated by tasso in his third book where erminia from the walls of jerusalem points out the chief warriors to the king though the latter part is perhaps copied too closely and minutely for he describes godfrey to be of a port that bespeaks him a prince the next of somewhat a lower stature a third renowned for his wisdom and then another is distinguished by the largeness of his chest tnd breadth of his shoulders which are not only the very particulars but in the very order of homers  but however this manner of introduction has been admired there have not been wanting some exceptions to a particular or two scaliger asks how it happens that priam after nine years siege should be yet unacquainted with the faces of the grecian leaders this was an old cavil as appears by the scholia that pass under the name of didymus where it is very well answered that homer has just before taken care to tell us the heroes had put off their armor on this occasion of the truce which had concealed their persons till now others have objected to priams not knowing ulysses who as it appears afterward had been at troy on an embassy the answer is that this might happen either from the dimness of priams sight or defect of his memory or from the change of ulyssess features since that time  xxiv verse     before thy presence helen is so overwhelmed with grief and shame that she is unable to give a direct answer to priam without first humbling herself before him acknowledging her crime and testifying her repentance and she no sooner answers by naming agamemnon but her sorrows renew at the name he was once my brother but i am now a wretch unworthy to call him so  xxv verse     great in the war and great in arts of sway this was the verse which alexander the great preferred to all others in homer and which he proposed as the pattern of his own actions as including whatever can be desired in a prince plut orat de fort alex    xxvi verse   0 extolled the happy prince it was very natural for priam on this occasion to compare the declining condition of his kingdom with the flourishing state of agamemnons and to oppose his own misery who had lost most of his sons and his bravest warriors to the felicity of the other in being yet master of so gallant an army after this the humor of old age breaks out in the narration of what armies he had formerly seen and bore a part in the command of as well as what feats of valor he had then performed besides which this praise of the greeks from the mouth of an enemy was no small encomium of homers countrymen  xxvii verse     from rank to rank he moves the vigilance and inspection of ulysses were very proper marks to distinguish him and agree with his character of a wise man no less than the grandeur and majesty before described with that of agamemnon as the supreme ruler whereas we find ajax afterward taken notice of only for his bulk as a heavy hero without parts or authority this decorum is observable  xxviii verse     i knew their persons etc in this view of the leaders of the army it had been an oversight in homer to have taken no notice of menelaus who was not only one of the principal of them but was immediately to engage the observation of the reader in the single combat on the other hand it had been a high indecorum to have made helena speak of him he has therefore put his praises into the mouth of antenor which was also a more artful way than to have presented him to the eye of priam in the same manner with the rest it appears from hence what a regard he has had both to decency and variety in the conduct of his poem this passage concerning the different eloquence of menelaus and ulysses is inexpressibly just and beautiful the close laconick conciseness of the one is finely opposite to the copious vehement and penetrating oratory of the other which is so exquisitely described in the simile of the snow falling fast and sinking deep for it is in this the beauty of the comparison consists according to quintilian l    c  0 in ulysse facundiam and magnitudinem junxit cui orationem nivibus hybernis copia verborum atque impetu parem tribuit we may set in the same light with these the character of nestors eloquence which consisted in softness and persuasiveness and is therefore in contradistinction to this of ulysses compared to honey which drops gently and slowly a manner of speech extremely natural to a benevolent old man such as nestor is represented ausonius has elegantly distinguished these three kinds of oratory in the following verses dulcem in paucis ut plisthenidem et torrentem ceu dulichii ningida dicta  et mellitae nectare vocis dulcia fatu verba canentem nestora regem    xxix verse     he spoke no more than just the thing he ought chapman in his notes on this place and on the second book has described menelaus as a character of ridicule and simplicity he takes advantage from the word  here made use of to interpret that of the shrillness of his voice which was applied to the acuteness of his sense he observes that this sort of voice is a mark of a fool that menelauss coming to his brothers feast uninvited in the second book has occasioned a proverb of folly that the excuse homer himself makes for it because his brother might forget to invite him through much business is purely ironical that the epithet  which is often applied to him should not be translated warlike but one who had an affectation of loving war in short that he was a weak prince played upon by others short in speech and of a bad pronunciation valiant only by fits and sometimes stumbling upon good matter in his speeches as may happen to the most slender capacity this is one of the mysteries which that translator boasts to have found in homer but as it is no way consistent with the art of the poet to draw the person in whose behalf he engages the world in such a manner as no regard should be conceived for him we must endeavor to rescue him from this misrepresentation first then the present passage is taken by antiquity in general to be applied not to his pronunciation but his eloquence so ausonius in the foregoing citation and cicero de claris oratoribus menelaum ipsum dulcem illum quidem tradit homerus sed pauca loquentem and quintilian l    c  0 homerus brevem cum animi jucunditate and propriam  id enim est non errare verbis and carentem supervacuis eloquentiam menelao dedit etc secondly though his coming uninvited may have occasioned a jesting proverb it may naturally be accounted for on the principle of brotherly love which so visibly characterises both him and agamemnon throughout the poem thirdly  may import a love of war but not an ungrounded affectation upon the whole his character is by no means contemptible though not of the most shining nature he is called indeed in the    th iliad  a soft warrior or one whose strength is of the second rate and so his brother thought him when he preferred nine before him to fight with hector in the   th book but on the other hand his courage gives him a considerable figure in conquering paris defending the body of patroclus rescuing ulysses wounding helenus killing euphorbus etc he is full of resentment for his private injuries which brings him to the war with a spirit of revenge in the second book makes him blaspheme jupiter in the third when paris escapes him and curse the grecians in the seventh when they hesitate to accept hectors challenge but this also is qualified with a compassion for those who suffer in his cause which he every where manifests upon proper occasions and with an industry to gratify others as when he obeys ajax in the seventeenth book and goes upon his errand to find antilochus with some other condescensions of the like nature thus his character is composed of qualities which give him no uneasy superiority over others while he wants their assistance and mingled with such as make him amiable enough to obtain it  xxx verse   0 his modest eyes etc this behavior of ulysses is copied by ovid met    astitit atque oculos parum tellure moratos sustulit  what follows in the greek translated word for word runs thus he seemed like a fool you would have thought him in a rage or a madman how oddly this would appear in our language i appeal to those who have read ogilby the whole period means no more than to describe that behavior which is commonly remarkable in a modest and sensible man who speaks in public his diffidence and respect gives him at his first rising a sort of confusion which is not indecent and which serves but the more to heighten the surprise and esteem of those who hear him  xxxi verse  0  perhaps their swords this is another stroke of helens concern the sense of her crime is perpetually afflicting her and awakes upon every occasion the lines that follow wherein homer gives us to understand that castor and pollux were now dead are finely introduced and in the spirit of poetry the muse is supposed to know every thing past and to come and to see things distant as well as present  xxxii verse     mean time the heralds etc it may not be unpleasing to the reader to compare the description of the ceremonies of the league in the following part with that of virgil in the twelfth book the preparations the procession of the kings and their congress are much more solemn and poetical in the latter the oath and adjurations are equally noble in both  xxxiii verse     the curling hair we have here the whole ceremonial of the solemn oath as it was observed anciently by the nations our author describes i must take this occasion of remarking that we might spare our selves the trouble of reading most books of grecian antiquities only by being well versed in homer they are generally bare transcriptions of him but with this unnecessary addition that after having quoted any thing in verse they say the same over again in prose the antiquitates homericae of feithius may serve as an instance of this what my lord bacon observes of authors in general is particularly applicable to these of antiquities that they write for ostentation not for instruction and that their works are perpetual repetitions  xxxiv verse     and age to age record the signal day  this seems the natural sense of the line and not as madam dacier renders it the tribute shall be paid to the posterity of the greeks for ever i think she is single in that explication the majority of the interpreters taking it to signify that the victory of the grecians and this pecuniary acknowledgment should be recorded to all posterity if it means any more than this at least it cannot come up to the sense madam dacier gives it for a nation put under perpetual tribute is rather enslaved than received to friendship and alliance which are the terms of agamemnons speech it seems rather to be a fine demanded as a recompense for the expenses of the war which being made over to the greeks should remain to their posterity for ever that is to say which they should never be molested for or which should never be redemanded in any age as a case of injury the phrase is the same we use at this day when any purchase or grant is at once made over to a man and his heirs for ever with this will agree the scholiasts note which tells us the mulct was reported to have been half the goods then in the besieged city  xxxv verse     the chief the tender victims slew one of the grand objections which the ignorance of some moderns has raised against homer is what they call a defect in the manners of his heroes they are shocked to find his kings employed in such offices as slaughtering of beasts etc but they forget that sacrificing was the most solemn act of religion and that kings of old in most nations were also chiefpriests this among other objections of the same kind the reader may see answered in the preface  xxxvi verse     give me great jove homer puts a prayer in the mouth of menelaus but none in pariss menelaus is the person injured and innocent and may therefore apply to god for justice but paris who is the criminal remains silent spondanus  xxxvii verse     the brittle steel unfaithful to his hand broke short  this verse is cut to express the thing it describes the snapping short of the sword it is the observation of eustathius on this line of the original that we do not only see the action but imagine we hear the sound of the breaking sword in that of the words  and that homer designed it may appear from his having twice put in the  which was a letter unnecessary to cause this harshness in the verse as this beauty could not be preserved in our language it is endeavored in the translation to supply it with something parallel  xxxviii verse     the goddess softly shook etc venus having conveyed paris in safety to his chamber goes to helena who had been spectator of his defeat in order to draw her to his love the better to bring this about she first takes upon her the most proper form in the world that of a favorite servantmaid and awakens her passion by representing to her the beautiful figure of his person next assuming her own shape she frightens her into a compliance notwithstanding all the struggles of shame fear and anger which break out in her speech to the goddess this machine is allegorical and means no more than the power of love triumphing over all the considerations of honor ease and safety it has an excellent effect as to the poem in preserving still in some degree our good opinion of helena whom we look upon with compassion as constrained by a superior power and whose speech tends to justify her in the eye of the reader  xxxix verse     she spoke and helen s secret soul was moved nothing is more fine than this the first thought of pariss beauty overcomes unawares to herself the contempt she had that moment conceived of him upon his overthrow this motion is but natural and before she perceives the deity when the affections of a woman have been thoroughly gained though they may be alienated for a while they soon return upon her homer knew says madam dacier what a woman is capable of who had once loved  xl verse  0  for me to lawless love no longer led i scorn the coward we have here another branch of the female character which is to be ruled in their attaches by success helen finding the victory belonged to menelaus accuses herself secretly of having forsaken him for the other and immediately entertains a high opinion of the man she had once despised one may add that the fair sex are generally admirers of courage and naturally friends to great soldiers paris was no stranger to this disposition in them and had formerly endeavored to give her that opinion of himself as appears from her reproach to him afterward  xli verse     should venus leave thee every charm must fly this was the most dreadful of all threats loss of beauty and of reputation helen who had been proof to the personal appearance of the goddess and durst even reproach her with bitterness just before yields to this and obeys all the dictates of love  xlii verse     she turned away her glowing eyes this interview of the two lovers placed opposite to each other and overlooked by venus paris gazing on helena she turning away her eyes shining at once with anger and love are particulars finely drawn and painted up to all the life of nature eustathius imagines she looked aside in the consciousness of her own weakness as apprehending that the beauty of paris might cause her to relent her bursting out into passion and reproaches while she is in this state of mind is no ill picture of frailty venus as madam dacier observes does not leave her and fondness will immediately succeed to these reproaches  xliii verse     ah cease divinely fair this answer of paris is the only one he could possibly have made with any success in his circumstance there was no other method to reconcile her to him but that which is generally most powerful with the sex and which homer who was learned every way here makes use of  xliv verse     when first entranced in cranae s isle it is in the original  the true sense of which is expressed in the translation i cannot but take notice of a small piece of pruderie in madam dacier who is exceeding careful of helens character she turns this passage as if paris had only her consent to be her husband in this island pausanias explains this line in another manner and tells us it was here that paris had first the enjoyment of her that in gratitude for his happiness he built a temple of venus migonitis the mingler or coupler and that the neighboring coast where it was erected was called migonian from  a miscendo paus laconicis  xlv verse     not thus i loved thee however homer may be admired for his conduct in this passage i find a general outcry against paris on this occasion plutarch has led the way in his treatise of reading poets by remarking it as a most heinous act of incontinence in him to go to bed to his lady in the daytime among the commentators the most violent is the moral expositor spondanus who will not so much as allow him to say a civil thing to helen mollis effoeminatus and spurcus ille adulter nihil de libidine sua imminutum dicit sed nunc magis ea corripi quam unquam alias ne quidem cum primum ea ipsi dedit  latini ita recte exprimunt  in re venerea in insula cranae cum alioqui homines primi concubitus soleant esse ardentiores i could not deny the reader the diversion of this remark nor spondauus the glory of his zeal who was but two and twenty when it was written madam dacier is also very severe upon paris but for a reason more natural to a lady she is of opinion that the passion of the lover would scarce have been so excessive as he here describes it but for fear of losing his mistress immediately as foreseeing the greeks would demand her one may answer to this lively remark that paris having nothing to say for himself was obliged to testify an uncommon ardour for his lady at a time when compliments were to pass instead of reasons i hope to be excused if in revenge for her remark upon our sex i observe upon the behavior of helen throughout this book which gives a pretty natural picture of the manners of theirs we see her first in tears repentant covered with confusion at the sight of priam and secretly inclined to return to her former spouse the disgrace of paris increases her dislike of him she rails she reproaches she wishes his death and after all is prevailed upon by one kind compliment and yields to his embraces methinks when this ladys observation and mine are laid together the best that can be made of them is to conclude that since both the sexes have their frailties it would be well for each to forgive the other  it is worth looking backward to observe the allegory here carried on with respect to helena who lives through this whole book in a whirl of passions and is agitated by turns with sentiments of honor and love the goddesses made use of to cast the appearance of fable over the story are iris and venus when helen is called to the tower to behold her former friends iris the messenger of juno the goddess of honor is sent for her and when invited to the bedchamber of paris venus is to beckon her out of the company the forms they take to carry on these different affairs are properly chosen the one assuming the person of the daughter of antenor who pressed most for her being restored to menelaus the other the shape of an old maid who was privy to the intrigue with paris from the beginning and in the consequences as the one inspires the love of her former empire friends and country so the other instills the dread of being cast off by all if she forsook her second choice and causes the return of her tenderness to paris but if she has a struggle for honor she is in a bondage to love which gives the story its turn that way and makes venus oftener appear than iris there is in one place a lover to be protected in another a lovequarrel to be made up in both which the goddess is kindly officious she conveys paris to troy when he had escaped the enemy which may hint his love for his mistress that hurried him away to justify himself before her she softens and terrifies helen in order to make up the breach between them and even when that affair is finished we do not find the poet dismisses her from the chamber whatever privacies the lovers had a mind to in which circumstance he seems to draw aside the veil of his allegory and to let the reader at last into this meaning of it that the goddess of love has been all the while nothing more than the passion of it  the fourth book of the iliad the argument the breach of the truce and the first battle the gods deliberate in council concerning the trojan war they agree upon the continuation of it and jupiter sends down minerva to break the truce she persuades pandarus to aim an arrow at menelaus who is wounded but cured by machaon in the mean time some of the trojan troops attack the greeks agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general he reviews the troops and exhorts the leaders some by praises and others by reproofs nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline the battle joins and great numbers are slain on both sides  the same day continues through this as through the last book as it does also through the two following and almost to the end of the seventh book the scene is wholly in the field before troy  the fourth book of the iliad and now olympus shining gates unfold the gods with jove assume their thrones of gold immortal hebe fresh with bloom divine the golden goblets crowns with purple wine while the full bowls flow round the powers employ their careful eyes on longcontended troy when jove disposed to tempt saturnias spleen thus waked the fury of his partial queen two powers divine the son of atreus aid imperial juno and the martial maid but high in heaven they sit and gaze from far the tame spectators of his deeds of war not thus fair venus helps her favored knight the queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight each danger wards and constant in her care saves in the moment of the last despair her act has rescued paris forfeit life though great atrides gained the glorious strife then say ye powers what signal issue waits to crown this deed and finish all the fates shall heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare or rowze the furies and awake the war yet would the gods for human good provide atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride still priams walls in peaceful honors grow and through his gates the crowding nations flow thus while he spoke the queen of heaven enraged and queen of war in close consult engaged apart they sit their deep designs employ and meditate the future woes of troy though secret anger swelled minervas breast the prudent goddess yet her wrath suppressed but juno impotent of passion broke her sullen silence and with fury spoke shall then o tyrant of the ethereal reign my schemes my labors and my hopes be vain have i for this shook ilion with alarms assembled nations set two worlds in arms to spread the war i flew from shore to shore the immortal coursers scarce the labor bore at length ripe vengeance over their heads impends but jove himself the faithless race defends loath as thou art to punish lawless lust not all the gods are partial and unjust the sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies sighs from his inmost soul and thus replies oh lasting rancour oh insatiate hate to phrygias monarch and the phrygian state what high offense has fired the wife of jove can wretched mortals harm the powers above that troy and troys whole race thou would confound and yon fair structures level with the ground haste leave the skies fulfill thy stern desire burst all her gates and wrap her walls in fire let priam bleed if yet thou thirst for more bleed all his sons and ilion float with gore to boundless vengeance the wide realm be given till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven so let it be and jove his peace enjoy when heaven no longer hears the name of troy but should this arm prepare to wreak our hate on thy loved realms whose guilt demands their fate presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay remember troy and give the vengeance way for know of all the numerous towns that rise beneath the rolling sun and starry skies which gods have raised or earthborn men enjoy none stands so dear to jove as sacred troy no mortals merit more distinguished grace than godlike priam or than priams race still to our name their hecatombs expire and altars blaze with unextinguishd fire at this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes then on the thundrer fixed them and replies three towns are junos on the grecian plains more dear than all the extended earth contains mycenae argos and the spartan wall these thou may raze nor i forbid their fall it is not in me the vengeance to remove the crimes sufficient that they share my love of power superior why should i complain resent i may but must resent in vain yet some distinction juno might require sprung with thy self from one celestial sire a goddess born to share the realms above and styled the consort of the thundering jove nor thou a wife and sisters right deny let both consent and both by turns comply so shall the gods our joint decrees obey and heaven shall act as we direct the way see ready pallas waits thy high commands to raise in arms the greek and phrygian bands their sudden friendship by her arts may cease and the proud trojans first infringe the peace the sire of men and monarch of the sky the advice approved and bade minerva fly dissolve the league and all her arts employ to make the breach the faithless act of troy fired with the charge she headlong urged her flight and shot like lightning from olympus height as the red comet from saturnius sent to fright the nations with a dire portent a fatal sign to armies on the plain or trembling sailors on the wintry main with sweeping glories glides along in air and shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair between both armies thus in open sight shot the bright goddess in a trial of light with eyes erect the gazing hosts admire the power descending and the heavens on fire the gods they cried the gods this signal sent and fate now labors with some vast event jove seals the league or bloodier scenes prepares jove the great arbiter of peace and wars they said while pallas through the trojan throng in shape a mortal passed disguised along like bold laodocus her course she bent who from antenor traced his high descent amidst the ranks lycaons son she found the warlike pandarus for strength renowned whose squadrons led from black aesepus flood with flaming shields in martial circle stood to him the goddess phrygian can thou hear a welltimd counsel with a willing ear what praise were thine coudst thou direct thy dart amidst his triumph to the spartans heart what gifts from troy from paris woudst thou gain thy countrys foe the grecian glory slain then seize the occasion dare the mighty deed aim at his breast and may that aim succeed but first to speed the shaft address thy vow to lycian phoebus with the silver bow and swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay on zelias altars to the god of day he heard and madly at the motion pleased his polished bow with hasty rashness seized twas formed of horn and smoothed with artful toil a mountain goat resigned the shining spoil who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled the stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead and sixteen palms his brows large honors spread the workman joined and shaped the bended horns and beaten gold each taper point adorns this by the greeks unseen the warrior bends screend by the shields of his surrounding friends there meditates the mark and couching low fits the sharp arrow to the wellstrung bow one from a hundred feathered deaths he chose fated to wound and cause of future woes then offers vows with hecatombs to crown apollos altars in his native town now with full force the yielding horn he bends drawn to an arch and joins the doubling ends close to his breast he strains the nerve below till the barbd point approach the circling bow the impatient weapon whizzes on the wing sounds the tough horn and twangs the quivering string but thee atrides in that dangerous hour the gods forget not nor thy guardian power pallas assists and weakened in its force diverts the weapon from the destined course so from her babe when slumber seals his eye the watchful mother wafts the envenomed fly just where his belt with golden buckles joined where linen folds the double corslet lined she turned the shaft which hissing from above passed the broad belt and through the corslet drove the folds it pierced the plaited linen tore and razed the skin and drew the purple gore as when some stately trappings are decreed to grace a monarch on his bounding steed a nymph in caria or meonia bred stains the pure ivory with a lively red with equal luster various colors vie the shining whiteness and the tyrian dye so great atrides showed thy sacred blood as down thy snowie thigh distilled the streaming flood with horror seized the king of men descried the shaft infixd and saw the gushing tide nor less the spartan feared before he found the shining barb appear above the wound then with a sigh that heaved his manly breast the royal brother thus his grief expressed and grasped his hand while all the greeks around with answering sighs returned the plaintive sound oh dear as life did i for this agree the solemn truce a fatal truce to thee were thou exposed to all the hostile train to fight for greece and conquer to be slain the race of trojans in thy ruin join and faith is scorned by all the perjured line not thus our vows confirmed with wine and gore those hands we plighted and those oaths we swore shall all be vain when heavens revenge is slow jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow the day shall come that great avenging day which troys proud glories in the dust shall lay when priams powers and priams self shall fall and one prodigious ruin swallow all i see the god already from the pole bare his red arm and bid the thunder roll i see the eternal all his fury shed and shake his aegis over their guilty head such mighty woes on perjured princes wait but thou alas deserve a happier fate still must i mourn the period of thy days and only mourn without my share of praise deprived of thee the heartless greeks no more shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore troy seized of helen and our glory lost thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast while some proud trojan thus insulting cries and spurns the dust where menelaus lies  such are the trophies greece from ilion brings  and such the conquests of her king of kings  lo his proud vessels scattered over the main  and unrevenged his mighty brother slain oh ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame overwhelm me earth and hide a monarchs shame he said a leaders and a brothers fears possess his soul which thus the spartan chears let not thy words the warmth of greece abate the feeble dart is guiltless of my fate stiff with the rich embroidered work around my varied belt repelled the flying wound to whom the king my brother and my friend thus always thus may heaven thy life defend now seek some skilful hand whose powerful art may stanch the effusion and extract the dart herald be swift and bid machaon bring his speedy succor to the spartan king pierced with a winged shaft the deed of troy the grecians sorrow and the dardans joy with hasty zeal the swift talthybius flies through the thick files he darts his searching eyes and finds machaon where sublime he stands in arms encircled with his native bands then thus machaon to the king repair his wounded brother claims thy timely care pierced by some lycian or dardanian bow a grief to us a triumph to the foe the heavy tidings grieved the godlike man swift to his succor through the ranks he ran the dauntless king yet standing firm he found and all the chiefs in deep concern around where to the steely point the reed was joined the shaft he drew but left the head behind strait the broad belt with gay embroidry graced he loosed the corslet from his breast unbracd then sucked the blood and sovereign balm infused which chiron gave and aesculapius used while round the prince the greeks employ their care the trojans rush tumultuous to the war once more they glitter in refulgent arms once more the fields are filled with dire alarms nor had you seen the king of men appear confused unactive or surpised with fear but fond of glory with severe delight his beating bosom claimed the rising fight no longer with his warlike steeds he stayed or pressed the car with polished brass inlayd but left eurymedon the reins to guide the fiery coursers snorted at his side on foot through all the martial ranks he moves and these encourages and those reproves brave men he cries to such who boldly dare urge their swift steeds to face the coming war your ancient valor on the foes approve jove is with greece and let us trust in jove it is not for us but guilty troy to dread whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head her sons and matrons greece shall lead in chains and her dead warriors strew the mournful plains thus with new ardour he the brave inspires or thus the fearful with reproaches fires shame to your country scandal of your kind born to the fate ye well deserve to find why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain prepared for flight but doomed to fly in vain confused and panting thus the hunted deer falls as he flies a victim to his fear still must ye wait the foes and still retire till yon tall vessels blaze with trojan fire or trust ye jove a valiant foe shall chase to save a trembling heartless dastard race this said he stalked with ample strides along to cretes brave monarch and his martial throng high at their head he saw the chief appear and bold meriones excite the rear at this the king his generous joy expressed and clasped the warrior to his armed breast divine idomeneus what thanks we owe to worth like thine what praise shall we bestow to thee the foremost honors are decreed first in the fight and every graceful deed for this in banquets when the generous bowls restore our blood and raise the warriors souls though all the rest with stated rules we bound unmixed unmeasured are thy goblets crowned be still thy self in arms a mighty name maintain thy honors and enlarge thy fame to whom the cretan thus his speech addressed secure of me o king exhort the rest fixed to thy side in every toil i share thy firm associate in the day of war but let the signal be this moment given to mix in fight is all i ask of heaven the field shall prove how perjuries succeed and chains or death avenge their impious deed charmed with this heat the king his course pursues and next the troops of either ajax views in one firm orb the bands were ranged around a cloud of heroes blackened all the ground thus from the lofty promontorys brow a swain surveys the gathering storm below slow from the main the heavy vapors rise spread in dim streams and sail along the skies till black as night the swelling tempest shows the cloud condensing as the westwind blows he dreads the impending storm and drives his flock to the close covert of an arching rock such and so thick the embatteld squadrons stood with spears erect a moving iron wood a shady light was shot from glimmering shields and their brown arms obscured the dusky fields o heroes worthy such a dauntless train whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain exclaimed the king who raise your eager bands with great examples more than loud commands ah would the gods but breathe in all the rest such souls as burn in your exalted breast soon should our arms with just success be crowned and troys proud walls lie smoking on the ground then to the next the general bends his course his heart exults and glories in his force there reverend nestor ranks his pylian bands and with inspiring eloquence commands with strictest order sets his train in arms the chiefs advises and the soldiers warms alastor chromius haemon round him wait bias the good and pelagon the great the horse and chariots to the front assigned the foot the strength of war he ranged behind the middle space suspected troops supply enclosed by both nor left the power to fly he gives command to curb the fiery steed nor cause confusion nor the ranks exceed before the rest let none too rashly ride no strength or skill but just in time be tried the charge once made no warrior turn the rein but fight or fall a firm embodied train he whom the fortune of the field shall cast from forth his chariot mount the next in haste nor seek unpracticed to direct the car content with javlins to provoke the war our great forefathers held this prudent course thus ruled their ardour thus preserved their force by laws like these immortal conquests made and earths proud tyrants low in ashes laid so spoke the master of the martial art and touched with transport great atrides heart oh had thou strength to match thy brave desires and nerves to second what thy soul inspires but wasting years that wither human race exhaust thy spirits and thy arms unbrace what once thou were oh ever might thou be and age the lot of any chief but thee thus to the experienced prince atrides cried he shook his hoary locks and thus replied well might i wish could mortal wish renew that strength which once in boiling youth i knew such as i was when ereuthalion slain beneath this arm fell prostrate on the plain but heaven its gifts not all at once bestows these years with wisdom crowns with action those the field of combat fits the young and bold the solemn council best becomes the old to you the glorious conflict i resign let sage advice the palm of age be mine he said with joy the monarch marched before and found menestheus on the dusty shore with whom the firm athenian phalanx stands and next ulysses with his subject bands remote their forces lay nor knew so far the peace infringed nor heard the sounds of war the tumult late begun they stood intent to watch the motion dubious of the event the king who saw their squadrons yet unmoved with hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved can peteus son forget a warriors part and fears ulysses skilled in every art why stand you distant and the rest expect to mix in combat which your selves neglect from you twas hoped among the first to dare the shock of armies and commence the war for this your names are called before the rest to share the pleasures of the genial feast and can you chiefs without a blush survey whole troops before you laboring in the fray say is it thus those honors you requite the first in banquets but the last in fight ulysses heard the heros warmth overspread his cheek with blushes and severe he said take back the unjust reproach behold we stand sheathed in bright arms and but expect command if glorious deeds afford thy soul delight behold me plunging in the thickest fight then give thy warriorchief a warriors due who dares to act whatever thou dare to view struck with his generous wrath the king replies oh great in action and in council wise with ours thy care and ardour are the same nor need i to command nor ought to blame sage as thou art and learned in humankind forgive the transport of a martial mind haste to the fight secure of just amends the gods that make shall keep the worthy friends he said and passed where great tydides lay his steeds and chariots wedged in firm array the warlike sthenelus attends his side to whom with stern reproach the monarch cried oh son of tydeus he whose strength could tame the bounding steed in arms a mighty name can thou remote the mingling hosts descry with hands unactive and a careless eye not thus thy sire the fierce encounter feared still first in front the matchless prince appeared what glorious toils what wonders they recite who viewed him laboring through the ranks of fight i saw him once when gathering martial powers a peaceful guest he sought mycenaes towers armies he asked and armies had been given not we denied but jove forbad from heaven while dreadful comets glaring from afar forewarned the horrors of the theban war next sent by greece from where asopus flows a fearless envoy he approached the foes thebes hostile walls unguarded and alone dauntless he enters and demands the throne the tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found and dared to combat all those chiefs around dared and subdued before their haughty lord for pallas strung his arm and edged his sword stung with the shame within the winding way to bar his passage fifty warriors lay two heroes led the secret squadron on moeon the fierce and hardy lycophon those fifty slaughtered in the gloomy vale he spared but one to bear the dreadful tale such tydeus was and such his martial fire gods how the son degenrates from the sire no words the godlike diomed returned but heard respectful and in secret burned not so fierce capaneus undaunted son stern as his sire the boaster thus begun what needs o monarch this invidious praise our selves to lessen while our sires you raise dare to be just atrides and confess our valor equal though our fury less with fewer troops we stormed the theban wall and happier saw the sevnfold city fall in impious acts the guilty fathers died the sons subdued for heaven was on their side far more than heirs of all our parents fame our glories darken their diminished name to him tydides thus my friend forbear suppress thy passion and the king revere his high concern may well excuse this rage whose cause we follow and whose war we wage his the first praise were ilions towers overthrown and if we fail the chief disgrace his own let him the greeks to hardy toils excite it is ours to labor in the glorious fight he spoke and ardent on the trembling ground sprung from his car his ringing arms resound dire was the clang and dreadful from afar of armed tydides rushing to the war as when the winds ascending by degrees first move the whitening surface of the seas the billows float in order to the shore the wave behind rolls on the wave before till with the growing storm the deeps arise foam over the rocks and thunder to the skies so to the fight the thick battalions throng shields urged on shields and men drove men along sedate and silent move the numerous bands no sound no whisper but their chiefs commands those only heard with awe the rest obey as if some god had snatched their voice away not so the trojans from their host ascends a general shout that all the region rends as when the fleecy flocks unnumberd stand in wealthy folds and wait the milkers hand the hollow vales incessant bleating fills the lambs reply from all the neighboring hills such clamours rose from various nations round mixed was the murmur and confused the sound each host now joins and each a god inspires these mars incites and those minerva fires pale flight around and dreadful terror reign and discord raging bathes the purple plain discord dire sister of the slaughtring power small at her birth but rising every hour while scarce the skies her horrid head can bound she stalks on earth and shakes the world around the nations bleed wherever her steps she turns the groan still deepens and the combat burns now shield with shield with helmet helmet closed to armor armor lance to lance opposed host against host with shadowy squadrons drew the sounding darts in iron tempests flew victors and vanquished join promiscuous cries and shrilling shouts and dying groans arise with streaming blood the slippery fields are died and slaughtered heroes swell the dreadful tide as torrents roll increased by numerous rills with rage impetuous down their ecchoing hills rush to the vales and poured along the plain roar through a thousand channels to the main the distant shepherd trembling hears the sound so mix both hosts and so their cries rebound the bold antilochus the slaughter led the first who struck a valiant trojan dead at great echepolus the lance arrives razed his high crest and through his helmet drives warmed in the brain the brazen weapon lies and shades eternal settle over his eyes so sinks a tower that long assaults had stood of force and fire its walls besmeared with blood him the bold elphenor leader of the abantian throng seized to despoil and dragged the corpse along but while he strove to tug the inserted dart agenors javelin reached the heros heart his flank unguarded by his ample shield admits the lance he falls and spurns the field the nerves unbracd support his limbs no more the soul comes floating in a tide of gore trojans and greeks now gather round the slain the war renews the warriors bleed again as over their prey rapacious wolves engage man dies on man and all is blood and rage in blooming youth fair simoisius fell sent by great ajax to the shades of hell fair simoisius whom his mother bore amid the flocks on silver simois shore the nymph descending from the hills of i would to seek her parents on his flowery side brought forth the babe their common care and joy and thence from simois named the lovely boy short was his date by dreadful ajax slain he falls and renders all their cares in vain so falls a poplar that in watery ground raised high the head with stately branches crowned felled by some artist with his shining steel to shape the circle of the bending wheel cut down it lies tall smooth and largely spread with all its beauteous honors on its head there left a subject to the wind and rain and scorched by suns it withers on the plain thus pierced by ajax simoisius lies stretched on the shore and thus neglected dies at ajax antiphus his javelin threw the pointed lance with erring fury flew and leucus loved by wise ulysses slew he drops the corpse of simoisius slain and sinks a breathless carcass on the plain this saw ulysses and with grief enraged strode where the foremost of the foes engaged armed with his spear he meditates the wound in act to throw but cautious looked around struck at his sight the trojans backward drew and trembling heard the javelin as it flew a chief stood nigh who from abydos came old priams son democoon was his name the weapon entered close above his ear cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear with piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath his eye balls darken with the shades of death down sinks the chief his clanging arms resound and his broad buckler rings against the ground seized with affright the boldest foes appear even godlike hector seems himself to fear slow he gave way the rest tumultuous fled the greeks with shouts press on and spoil the dead but phoebus now from ilions towering height shines forth revealed and animates the fight trojans be bold and force with force oppose your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes nor are their bodies rocks nor ribbd with steel your weapons enter and your strokes they feel have ye forgot what seemed your dread before the great the fierce achilles fights no more apollo thus from ilions lofty towers arrayed in terrors rowzd the trojan powers while wars fierce goddess fires the grecian foe and shouts and thunders in the fields below then great diores fell by doom divine in vain his valor and illustrious line a broken rock the force of pirus threw who from cold aenus led the thracian crew full on his ankle dropped the ponderous stone burst the strong nerves and crashd the solid bone supine he tumbles on the crimsoned sands before his helpless friends and native bands and spreads for aid his unavailing hands the foe rushed furious as he pants for breath and through his navel drove the pointed death his gushing entrails smoked upon the ground and the warm life came issuing from the wound his lance bold thoas at the conquror sent deep in his breast above the pap it went amid the lungs was fixed the winged wood and quivering in his heaving bosom stood till from the dying chief approaching near the aetolian warrior tugged his weighty spear then sudden waved his flaming faulchion round and gashd his belly with a ghastly wound the corpse now breathless on the bloody plain to spoil his arms the victor strove in vain the thracian bands against the victor pressed a grove of lances glittered at his breast stern thoas glaring with revengeful eyes in sullen fury slowly quits the prize thus fell two heroes one the pride of thrace and one the leader of the epeian race deaths sable shade at once overcast their eyes in dust the vanquished and the victor lies with copious slaughter all the fields are red and heaped with growing mountains of the dead had some brave chief this martial scene beheld by pallas guarded through the dreadful field might darts be bid to turn their points away and swords around him innocently play the wars whole art with wonder had he seen and counted heroes where he counted men so fought each host with thirst of glory fired and crowds on crowds triumphantly expired observations on the fourth book observations on the fourth book i it was from the beginning of this book that virgil has taken that of his tenth aeneid as the whole tenor of the story in this and the last book is followed in his twelfth the truce and the solemn oath the breach of it by a dart thrown by tolumnius juturnas inciting the latins to renew the war the wound of aeneas his speedy cure and the battle ensuing all these are manifestly copied from hence the solemnity surprise and variety of these circumstances seemed to him of importance enough to build the whole catastrophe of his work upon them though in homer they are but openings to the general action and such as in their warmth are still exceeded by all that follows them they are chosen we grant by virgil with great judgment and conclude his poem with a becoming majesty yet the finishing his scheme with that which is but the coolest part of homers action tends in some degree to show the disparity of the poetical fire in these two authors  ii verse   immortal hebe the goddess of youth is introduced as an attendant upon the banquets of the gods to show that the divine beings enjoy an eternal youth and that their life is a felicity without end dacier  iii verse   two powers divine jupiters reproaching these two goddesses with neglecting to assist menelaus proceeds as m dacier remarks from the affection he bore to troy since if menelaus by their help had gained a complete victory the siege had been raised and the city delivered on the contrary juno and minerva might suffer paris to escape as the method to continue the war to the total destruction of troy and accordingly a few lines after we find them complotting together and contriving a new scene of miseries to the trojans  iv verse    though great atrides gained the glorious strife jupiter here makes it a question whether the foregoing combat should determine the controversy or the peace be broken his putting it thus that paris is not killed but menelaus has the victory gives a hint for a dispute whether the conditions of the treaty were valid or annulled that is to say whether the controversy was to be determined by the victory or by the death of one of the combatants accordingly it has been disputed whether the articles were really binding to the trojans or not plutarch has treated the question in his symposiacks l   qu    the substance is this in the first proposal of the challenge paris mentions only the victory and who his rival shall in arms subdue nor does hector who carries it say any more however menelaus understands it of the death by what he replies fall he that must beneath his rivals arms and live the rest  iris to helen speaks only of the former and idaeus to priam repeats the same words but in the solemn oath agamemnon specifies the latter if by paris slain  and if by my brothers arms the trojan bleed priam also understands it of both saying at his leaving the field what prince shall fall heaven only knows  i do not cite the greek because the english has preserved the same nicety paris himself confesses he has lost the victory in his speech to helen which he would hardly have done had the whole depended on that alone and lastly menelaus after the conquest is clearly his by the flight of paris is still searching round the field to kill him as if all were of no effect without the death of his adversary it appears from hence that the trojans had no ill pretense to break the treaty so that homer ought not to have been directly accused of making jupiter the author of perjury in what follows which is one of the chief of platos objections against him  v verse    though secret anger swelled minerva s breast spondanus takes notice that minerva who in the first book had restrained the anger of achilles had now an opportunity of exerting the same conduct in respect to herself we may bring the parallel close by observing that she had before her in like manner a superior who had provoked her by sharp expressions and whose counsels ran against her sentiments in all which the poet takes care to preserve her still in the practice of that wisdom of which she was goddess  vi verse    let priam bleed etc we find in persiuss satyrs the name of labeo as an ill poet who made a miserable translation of the iliad one of whose verses is still preserved and happens to be that of this place crudum manduces priamum priamique pisinnos it may seem from this that his translation was servilely literal as the old scholiast on persius observes and one cannot but take notice that ogilbys and hobbess in this place are not unlike labeos both king and people thou would eat alive and eat up priam and his children all   vii verse    but should this arm prepare to wreak our hate on thy loved towns   homer in this place has made jupiter to prophecy the destruction of mycenae the favored city of juno which happened a little before the time of our author strab l   the trojan war being over and the kingdom of agamemnon destroyed mycenae daily decreased after the return of the heraclidae for these becoming masters of peloponnesus cast out the old inhabitants so that they who possessed argos overcame mycenae also and contracted both into one body a short time after mycenae was destroyed by the argives and not the least remains of it are now to be found  viii verse    the advice approved this is one of the places for which homer is blamed by plato who introduces socrates reprehending it in his dialogue of the republic and indeed if it were granted that the trojans had no right to break this treaty the present machine where juno is made to propose perjury jupiter to allow it and minerva to be commissioned to hasten the execution of it would be one of the hardest to be reconciled to reason in the whole poem unless even then one might imagine that homers heaven is sometimes no more than an ideal world of abstracted beings and so every motion which rises in the mind of man is attributed to the quality to which it belongs with the name of the deity who is supposed to preside over that quality superadded to it in this sense the present allegory is easy enough pandarus thinks it prudence to gain honor and wealth at the hands of the trojans by destroying menelaus this sentiment is also incited by a notion of glory of which juno is represented as goddess jupiter who is supposed to know the thoughts of men permits the action which he is not author of but sends a prodigy at the same time to give warning of a coming mischief and accordingly we find both armies descanting upon the sight of it in the following lines  ix verse   0 pandarus for strength renowned homer says plutarch in his treatise of the pythian oracle makes not the gods to use all persons indifferently as their second agents but each according to the powers he is endud with by art or nature for a proof of this he puts us in mind how minerva when she would persuade the greeks seeks for ulysses when she would break the truce for pandarus and when she would conquer for diomed if we consult the scholia upon this instance they give several reasons why pandarus was particularly proper for the occasion the goddess went not to the trojans because they hated paris and as we are told in the end of the foregoing book would rather have given him up than have done an ill action for him she therefore looks among the allies and finds pandarus who was of a nation noted for perfidiousness and had a soul avaricious enough to be capable of engaging in this treachery for the hopes of a reward from paris as appears by his being so covetous as not to bring horses to the siege for fear of the expense or loss of them as he tells aeneas in the fifth book  x verse     sixteen palms both the horns together made this length and not each as madam dacier renders it i do not object it as an improbability that the horns were of sixteen palms each but that this would be an extravagant and unmanageable size for a bow is evident  xi verse     this by the greeks unseen the warrior bends the poet having held us through the foregoing book in expectation of a peace makes the conditions be here broken after such a manner as should oblige the greeks to act through the war with that irreconcilable fury which affords him the opportunity of exerting the full fire of his own genius the shot of pandarus being therefore of such consequence and as he calls it the  the foundation of future woes it was thought fit not to pass it over in a few words like the flight of every common arrow but to give it a description some way corresponding to its importance for this he surrounds it with a train of circumstances the history of the bow the bending it the covering pandarus with shields the choice of the arrow the prayer and posture of the shooter the sound of the string and flight of the shaft all most beautifully and livelily painted it may be observed too how proper a time it was to expatiate in these particulars when the armies being unemployd and only one man acting the poet and his readers had leisure to be the spectators of a single and deliberate action i think it will be allowed that the little circumstances which are sometimes thought too redundant in homer have a wonderful beauty in this place virgil has not failed to copy it and with the greatest happiness imaginable dixit and aurata volucrem threissa sagittam deprompsit pharetra cornuque infensa tetendit et duxit long donec curvata coirent inter se capita and manibus jam tangeret aequis laeva aciem ferri dextra nervoque papillam extemplo teli stridorem aurasque sonantes audiit una aruns haesitque in corpore ferrum   xii verse   0 pallas assists and weakened in its force diverts the weapon   for she only designed by all this action to increase the glory of the greeks in the taking of troy yet some commentators have been so stupid as to wonder that pallas should be employed first in the wounding of menelaus and after in the protecting him  xiii verse     wafts the winged hornet this is one of those humble comparisons which homer sometimes uses to diversify his subject but a very exact one in its kind and corresponding in all its parts the care of the goddess the unsuspecting security of menelaus the ease with which she diverts the danger and the danger itself are all included in this short compass to which it may be added that if the providence of heavenly powers to their creatures is expressed by the love of a mother to her child if men in regard to them are but as heedless sleeping infants and if those dangers which may seem great to us are by them as easily warded off as the simile implies there will appear something sublime in this conception however little or low the image may be thought at first sight in respect to a hero a higher comparison would but have tended to lessen the disparity between the gods and man and the justness of the simile had been lost as well as the grandeur of the sentiment  xiv verse   0 as when some stately trappings etc some have judged the circumstances in this simile to be superfluous and think it foreign to the purpose to take notice that this ivory was intended for the bosses of a bridle was laid up for a prince or that a woman of caria or meonia died it eustathius was of a different opinion who extols this passage for the variety it presents and the learning it includes we learn from hence that the lydians and carians were famous in the first times for their staining in purple and that the women excelled in works of ivory as also that there were certain ornaments which only kings and princes were privileged to wear but without having recourse to antiquities to justify this particular it may be alleged that the simile does not consist barely in the colors it was but little to tell us that the blood of menelaus appearing on the whiteness of his skin vyed with the purpled ivory but this implies that the honorable wounds of a hero are the beautiful dress of war and become him as much as the most gallant ornaments in which he takes the field virgil it is true has omitted the circumstance in his imitation of this comparison aen    indum sanguineo veluti violaverit ostro si quis ebur  but in this he judges only for himself and does not condemn homer it was by no means proper that his ivory should have been a piece of martial accoutrement when he applied it so differently transferring it from the wounds of a hero to the blushes of the fair lavinia  xv verse     as down thy snowy thigh homer is very particular here in giving the picture of the blood running in a long trace lower and lower as will appear from the words themselves   the translator has not thought fit to mention every one of these parts first the thigh then the leg then the foot which might be tedious in english but the authors design being only to image the streaming of the blood it seemed equivalent to make it trickle through the length of an alexandrine line  xvi verse     oh dear as life etc this incident of the wound of menelaus gives occasion to homer to draw a fine description of fraternal love in agamemnon on the first sight of it he is struck with amaze and confusion and now breaks out in tenderness and grief he first accuses himself as the cause of this misfortune by having consented to expose his brother to the single combat which had drawn on this fatal consequence next he inveighs against the trojans in general for their perfidiousness as not yet knowing it was the act of pandarus only he then comforts himself with the confidence that the gods will revenge him upon troy but doubts by what hands this punishment may be inflicted as fearing the death of menelaus will force the greeks to return with shame to their country there is no contradiction in all this but on the other side a great deal of nature in the confused sentiments of agamemnon on the occasion as they are very well explained by spondanus  xvii verse     while some proud trojan etc agamemnon here calls to mind how upon the death of his brother the ineffectual preparations and actions against troy must become a derision to the world this is in its own nature a very irritating sentiment though it were never so carelessly expressed but the poet has found out a peculiar air of aggravation in making him bring all the consequences before his eyes in a picture of their trojan enemies gathering round the tomb of the unhappy menelaus elated with pride insulting the dead and throwing out disdainful expressions and curses against him and his family there is nothing which could more effectually represent a state of anguish than the drawing such an image as this which shows a man increasing his present unhappiness by the prospect of a future train of misfortunes  xviii verse     let not thy words the warmth of greece abate in agamemnon homer has shown an example of a tender nature and fraternal affection and now in menelaus he gives us one of a generous warlike patience and presence of mind he speaks of his own case with no other regard but as this accident of his wound may tend to the discouragement of the soldiers and exhorts the general to beware of dejecting their spirits from the prosecution of the war spondanus  xix verse     the trojans rush tumultuous to the war they advanced to the enemy in the belief that the shot of pandarus was made by order of the generals dacier  xx verse     nor had you seen the poet here changes his narration and turns himself to the reader in an apostrophe longinus in his   d chapter commends this figure as causing a reader to become a spectator and keeping his mind fixed upon the action before him the apostrophe says he renders us more awakened more attentive and more full of the thing described madam dacier will have it that it is the muse who addresses herself to the poet in the second person it is no great matter which since it has equally its effect either way  xxi verse     through all the martial ranks he moves etc in the following review of the army which takes up a great part of this book we see all the spirit art and industry of a complete general together with the proper characters of those leaders whom he incites agamemnon considers at this sudden exigence that he should first address himself to all in general he divides his discourse to the brave and the fearful using arguments which arise from confidence or despair passions which act upon us most forcibly to the brave he urges their secure hopes of conquest since the gods must punish perjury to the timorous their inevitable destruction if the enemy should burn their ships after this he flies from rank to rank applying himself to each ally with particular artifice he caresses idomeneus as an old friend who had promised not to forsake him and meets with an answer in that heros true character short honest hearty and soldierlike he praises the ajaxes as warriors whose examples fired the army and is received by them without any reply as they were men who did not profess speaking he passes next to nestor whom he finds talking to his soldiers as he marshaled them here he was not to part without a compliment on both sides he wishes him the strength he had once in his youth and is answered with an account of something which the old hero had done in his former days from hence he goes to the troops which lay farthest from the place of action where he finds menestheus and ulysses not entirely unprepared nor yet in motion as being ignorant of what had happened he reproves ulysses for this with words agreeable to the hurry he is in and receives an answer which suits not ill with the twofold character of a wise and a valiant man hereupon agamemnon appears present to himself and excuses his hasty expressions the next he meets is diomed whom he also rebukes for backwardness but after another manner by setting before him the example of his father thus is agamemnon introduced praising terrifying exhorting blaming excusing himself and again relapsing into reproofs a lively picture of a great mind in the highest emotion and at the same time the variety is so kept up with a regard to the different characters of the leaders that our thoughts are not tired with running along with him over all his army  xxii verse     for this in banquets the ancients usually in their feasts divided to the guests by equal portions except when they took some particular occasion to show distinction and give the preference to any one person it was then looked upon as the highest mark of honor to be allotted the best portion of meat and wine and to be allowed an exemption from the laws of the feast in drinking wine unmingled and without stint this custom was much more ancient than the time of the trojan war and we find it practiced in the banquet given by joseph to his brethren in egypt genesis    ult and he sent messes to them from before him but benjamin s mess was five times so much as any of theirs dacier  xxiii verse     there reverend nestor ranks his pylian bands this is the prince whom homer chiefly celebrates for martial discipline of the rest he is content to say they were valiant and ready to fight the years long observation and experience of nestor rendered him the fittest person to be distinguished on this account the disposition of his troops in this place together with what he is made to say that their forefathers used the same method may be a proof that the art of war was well known in greece before the time of homer nor indeed can it be imagined otherwise in an age when all the world made their acquisitions by force of arms only what is most to be wondered at is that they had not the use of cavalry all men engaging either on foot or from chariots a particular necessary to be known by every reader of homers battles in these chariots there were always two persons one of whom only fought the other was wholly employed in managing the horses madam dacier in her excellent preface to homer is of opinion that there were no horsemen till near the time of saul threescore years after the siege of troy so that although cavalry were in use in homers days yet he thought himself obliged to regard the customs of the age of which he writ rather than those of his own  xxiv verse     the middle space suspected troops supply this artifice of placing those men whose behavior was most to be doubted in the middle so as to put them under a necessity of engaging even against their inclinations was followed by hannibal in the battle of zama as is observed and praised by polybius who quotes this verse on that occasion in acknowledgment of homers skill in military discipline that our author was the first master of that art in greece is the opinion of aelian tactic c   frontinus gives us another example of pyrrhus king of epiruss following this instruction of homer vide stratag lib   c   so ammianus marcellinus l    imperator catervis peditum infirmis medium inter acies spacium secundum homericam dispositionem praestituit  xxv verse     he whom the fortune of the field shall cast from forth his chariot mount the next  etc the words in the original are capable of four different significations as eustathius observes the first is that whoever in fighting upon his chariot shall win a chariot from his enemy he shall continue to fight and not retire from the engagement to secure his prize the second that if any one be thrown out of his chariot he who happens to be nearest shall hold forth his javelin to help him up into his own the third is directly the contrary to the last that if any one be cast from his chariot and would mount up into another mans that other shall push him back with his javelin and not admit him for fear of interrupting the combat the fourth is the sense which is followed in the translation as seeming much the most natural that every one should be left to govern his own chariot and the other who is admitted fight only with the javelin the reason of this advice appears by the speech of pandarus to aeneas in the next book aeneas having taken him up into his chariot to go against diomed compliments him with the choice either to fight or to manage the reins which was esteemed an office of honor to this pandarus answers that it is more proper for aeneas to guide his own horses lest they not feeling their accustomed master should be ungovernable and bring them into danger  upon occasion of the various and contrary significations of which these words are said to be capable and which eustathius and dacier profess to admire as an excellence mons de la motte in his late discourse upon homer very justly animadverts that if this be true it is a grievous fault in homer for what can be more absurd than to imagine that the orders given in a battle should be delivered in such ambiguous terms as to be capable of many meanings these double interpretations must proceed not from any design in the author but purely from the ignorance of the moderns in the greek tongue it being impossible for any one to possess the dead languages to such a degree as to be certain of all the graces and negligences or to know precisely how far the licenses and boldnesses of expression were happy or forced but critics to be thought learned attribute to the poet all the random senses that amuse them and imagine they see in a single word a whole heap of things which no modern language can express so are oftentimes charmed with nothing but the confusion of their own ideas  xxvi verse     remote their forces lay this is a reason why the troops of ulysses and menestheus were not yet in motion though another may be added in respect to the former that it did not consist with the wisdom of ulysses to fall on with his forces till he was well assured though courage be no inconsiderable part of his character yet it is always joined with great caution thus we see him soon after in the very heat of a battle when his friend was just slain before his eyes first looking carefully about him before he would throw his spear to revenge him  xxvii verse     i saw him once when etc this long narration concerning the history of tydeus is not of the nature of those for which homer has been blamed with some color of justice it is not a cold story but a warm reproof while the particularising the actions of the father is made the highest incentive to the son accordingly the air of this speech ought to be inspirited above the common narrative style as for the story itself it is finely told by statius in the second book of the thebais  xxviii verse     no words the godlike diomed returned when diomed is reproved by agamemnon he holds his peace in respect to his general but sthenelus retorts upon him with boasting and insolence it is here worth observing in what manner agamemnon behaves himself he passes by sthenelus without affording any reply whereas just before when ulysses testified his resentment he immediately returned him an answer for as it is a mean and servile thing and unbecoming the majesty of a prince to make apologies to every man in justification of what he has said or done so to treat all men with equal neglect is mere pride and excess of folly we also see of diomed that though he refrains from speaking in this place when the time demanded action he afterward expresses himself in such a manner as shows him not to have been insensible of this unjust rebuke  as in the ninth book when he tells the king he was the first who had dared to reproach him with want of courage plutarch of reading the poets  xxix verse     we stormed the theban wall the first theban war of which agamemnon spoke in the preceding lines was seven and twenty years before the war of troy sthenelus here speaks of the second theban war which happened ten years after the first when the sons of the seven captains conquered the city before which their fathers were destroyed tydeus expired gnawing the head of his enemy and capaneus was thunderstruck while he blasphemed jupiter vid stat thebaid  xxx verse     as when the winds madam dacier thinks it may seem something odd that an army going to conquer should be compared to the waves going to break themselves against the shore and would solve the appearing absurdity by imagining the poet laid not the stress so much upon this circumstance as upon the same waves assaulting a rock lifting themselves over its head and covering it with foam as the trophy of their victory as she expresses it but to this it may be answered that neither did the greeks get the better in this battle nor will a comparison be allowed entirely beautiful which instead of illustrating its subject stands itself in need of so much illustration and refinement to be brought to agree with it the passage naturally bears this sense as when upon the rising of the wind the waves roll after one another to the shore at first there is a distant motion in the sea then they approach to break with noise on the strand and lastly rise swelling over the rocks and toss their foam above their heads so the greeks at first marched in order one after another silently to the fight  where the poet breaks off from prosecuting the comparison and by a prolepsis leaves the reader to carry it on and image to himself the future tumult rage and force of the battle in opposition to that silence in which he describes the troops at present in the lines immediately ensuing what confirms this exposition is that virgil has made use of the simile in the same sense in the seventh aeneid fluctus uti primo coepit cum albescere vento paulatim sese tollit mare and altius undas erigit inde imo consurgit ad aethera fundo   xxxi verse     as when the winds etc this is the first battle in homer and it is worthy observation with what grandeur it is described and raised by one circumstance above another till all is involved in horror and tumult the foregoing simile of the winds rising by degrees into a general tempest is an image of the progress of his own spirit in this description we see first an innumerable army moving in order and are amused with the pomp and silence then wakened with the noise and clamor next they join the adverse gods are let down among them the imaginary persons of terror flight discord succeed to reinforce them then all is undistinguished fury and a confusion of horrors only that at different openings we behold the distinct deaths of several heroes and then are involved again in the same confusion  xxxii verse  0  discord dire sister etc this is the passage so highly extolled by longinus as one of the most signal instances of the noble sublimity of this author where it is said that the image here drawn of discord whose head touched the heavens and whose feet were on earth may as justly be applied to the vast reach and elevation of the genius of homer but mons boileau informs us that neither the quotation nor these words were in the original of longinus but partly inserted by gabriel de petra however the best encomium is that virgil has taken it word for word and applied it to the person of fame parva metu primo mox sese attollit in auras ingrediturque solo and caput inter nubila condit aristides had formerly blamed homer for admitting discord into heaven and scaliger takes up the criticism to throw him below virgil fame he says is properly feigned to hide her head in the clouds because the grounds and authors of rumors are commonly unknown as if the same might not be alleged for homer since the grounds and authors of discord are often no less secret macrobius has put this among the passages where he thinks virgil has fallen short in his imitation of homer and brings these reasons for his opinion homer represents discord to rise from small beginnings and afterward in her increase to reach the heavens virgil has said this of fame but not with equal propriety for the subjects are very different discord though it reaches to war and devastation is still discord nor ceases to be what it was at first but fame when it grows to be universal is fame no longer but becomes knowledge and certainty for who calls any thing fame which is known from earth to heaven nor has virgil equaled the strength of homers hyperbole for one speaks of heaven the other only of the clouds macrob sat l   c    scaliger is very angry at this last period and by mistake blames gellius for it in whom there is no such thing his words are so insolently dogmatical that barely to quote them is to answer them and the only answer which such a spirit of criticism deserves clamant quod maro de fama dixit eam inter nubila caput condere cum tamen homerus unde ipse accepit in coelo caput eridis constituit jam tibi pro me respondeo non sum imitatus nolo imitari non placet non est verum contentionem ponere caput in coelo ridiculum est fatuum est homericum est graeculum est poetic l   c    this fine verse was also criticizd by mons perault who accuses it as a forced and extravagant hyperbole m boileau answers that hyperboles as strong are daily used even in common discourse and that nothing is in effect more strictly true than that discord reigns over all the earth and in heaven itself that is to say among the gods of homer it is not continues this excellent critic the description of a giant as this censor would pretend but a just allegory and as he makes discord an allegorical person she may be of what size he pleases without shocking us since it is what we regard only as an idea and creature of the fancy and not as a material substance that has any being in nature the expression in the psalms that the impious man is lifted up as a cedar of libanus does by no means imply that the impious man was a giant as tall as the cedar thus far boileau and upon the whole we may observe that it seems not only the fate of great geniuss to have met with the most malignant critics but of the finest and noblest passages in them to have been particularly pitched upon for impertinent criticisms these are the divine boldnesses which in their very nature provoke ignorance and shortsightedness to show themselves and which whoever is capable of attaining must also certainly know that they will be attacked by such as cannot reach them  xxxiii verse  0  now shield with shield etc the verses which follow in the original are perhaps excelled by none in homer and that he had himself a particular fondness for them may be imagined from his inserting them again in the same words in the eighth book they are very happily imitated by statius lib   jam clypeus clypeis umbone repellitur umbo ense minax ensis pede pes and cuspide cuspis etc   xxxiv verse     as torrents roll this comparison of rivers meeting and roaring with two armies mingling in battle is an image of that nobleness which to say no more was worthy the invention of homer and the imitation of virgil aut ubi decursu rapido de montibus altis dant sonitum spumosi amnes and in aequora currunt quisque suum populatus iter  stupet inscius alto accipiens sonitum saxi de vertice pastor the word populatus here has a beauty which one must be insensible not to observe scaliger prefers virgils and macrobius homers without any reasons on either side but only one criticks positive word against anothers the reader may judge between them  xxxv verse     the bold antilochus antilochus the son of nestor is the first who begins the engagement it seems as if the old hero having done the greatest service he was capable of at his years in disposing the troops in the best order as we have seen before had taken care to set his son at the head of them to give him the glory of beginning the battle  xxxvi verse   0 as over their prey rapacious wolves engage this short comparison in the greek consists only of two words  which scaliger observes upon as too abrupt but may it not be answered that such a place as this where all things are in confusion seems not to admit of any simile except of one which scarce exceeds a metaphor in length when two heroes are engaged there is a plain view to be given us of their actions and there a long simile may be of use to raise and enliven them by parallel circumstances but when the troops fall in promiscuously upon one another the conclusion excludes distinct or partiticular images and consequently comparisons of any length would be less natural  xxxvii verse     in bloom of youth fair simoisius fell this prince received his name from the river simois on whose banks he was born it was the custom of the eastern people to give names to their children derived from the most remarkable accidents of their birth the holy scripture is full of examples of this kind it is also usual in the old testament to compare princes to trees cedars etc as simoisius is here resembled to a poplar dacier  xxxviii verse     so falls a poplar eustathius in macrobius prefers to this simile that of virgil in the second aeneid ac veluti in summis antiquam montibus ornum cum ferro accisam crebrisque bipennibus instant eruere agricolae certatim illa usque minatur et tremefacta comam concusso vertice nutat vulneribus donec paulatim evicta supremum congemuit traxitque jugis avulsa ruinam mr hobbes in the preface to his translation of homer has discoursed upon this occasion very judiciously homer says he intended no more in this place than to show how comely the body of simoisius appeared as he lay dead upon the bank of scamander strait and tall with a fair head of hair like a strait and high poplar with the boughs still on and not at all to describe the manner of his falling which when a man is wounded through the breast as he was with a spear is always sudden virgils is the description of a great tree falling when many men together hew it down he meant to compare the manner how troy after many battles and after the loss of many cities conquered by the many nations under agamemnon in a long war was thereby weakened and at last overthrown with a great tree hewn round about and then falling by little and little leisurely so that neither these two descriptions nor the two comparisons can be compared together the image of a man lying on the ground is one thing the image of falling especially of a kingdom is another this therefore gives no advantage to virgil over homer thus mr hobbes  xxxix verse     but phoebus now homer here introduces apollo on the side of the trojans he had given them the assistance of mars at the beginning of this battle but mars which signifies courage without conduct proving too weak to resist minerva or courage with conduct which the poet represents as constantly aiding his greeks they want some prudent management to rally them again he therefore brings in a wisdom to assist mars under the appearance of apollo  xl verse     achilles fights no more homer from time to time puts his readers in mind of achilles during his absence from the war and finds occasions of celebrating his valor with the highest praises there cannot be a greater encomium than this where apollo himself tells the trojans they have nothing to fear since achilles fights no longer against them dacier  xli verse   0 had some brave chief the turning off in this place from the actions of the field to represent to us a man with security and calmness walking through it without being able to reprehend any thing in the whole action this is not only a fine praise of the battle but as it were a breathingplace to the poetical spirit of the author after having rapidly run along with the heat of the engagement he seems like one who having got over a part of his journey stops upon an eminence to look back upon the space he has passed and concludes the book with an agreeable pause or respite  the reader will excuse our taking notice of such a trifle as that it was an old superstition that this fourth book of the iliads being laid under the head was a cure for the quartan ague serenus sammonicus a celebrated physician in the time of the younger gordian and preceptor to that emperor has gravely prescribed it among other receipts in his medicinal precepts praec  0 moeoniae iliados
