mayor  london printed for francis gosling at the mitre and crown in fleetstreet mdccxli  lambert mayor tuesday the ninth day of june      and in the fourteenth year of the reign of king george the second of great britain etc it is ordered that the thanks of this court be given to the reverend mr townley for his sermon preached before this court and the liveries of the several companies of this city at the cathedral church of st paul on friday the twenty ninth day of may last being the anniversary day of thanksgiving for the restoration of the royal family and government and that he be desired to print the same  man  to the right honorable daniel lambert esquire lord mayor of the city of london my lord i would fain have suppressed this sermon being sensible that it is very inaccurate and imperfect but as it is your particular order that it should appear in the world it must entirely depend on your lordships patronage for a favorable reception  to insist on those virtues that are so eminent in you would be disagreeable to a person of your lordships temper and only a repetition of the sentiments of all your fellowcitizens but since you have been pleased to admit me to a great degree of intimacy with yourself and by that means have made me a witness of your sincerity and integrity your goodnature and generosity your strict and impartial execution of justice and above all your concern and regard for religion i cannot help taking this occasion of publicly acknowledging the honor and happiness i therein receive  may that god whose worship and service you endeavor to promote by the best and most effectual method a good example shower down his blessings upon you and prosper all your labors for the welfare of the nation in general and of this city in particular  this is the hearty and sincere prayer of  my lord your lordships most obedient and most obliged servant james townley  psalm l    offer unto god thanksgiving the prophet samuel in his reproof to saul styles his successor   samuel xiii    the man after gods own heart which character was exemplified in no one instance more than in that thorough knowledge holy david had of the will of god with regard to the service he expects from his creatures  of this knowledge likewise the asaph author of this psalm had a large share vid patric comment whose words king hezekiah   chronicles xxix  0 commanded the levites to make use of with those of david in the house of the lord  he was fully sensible that the obedience god requires from men is that of the heart  the sacrifice of their wills far more pleasing to him than incense or   samuel xv    the fat of the rams  and the reason of this is evident for if a man reflects he will find that his will is that alone which he can properly call his own and therefore the only sacrifice he can offer unto the almighty to offer unto him burntofferings psalm the bullock out of thine house or hegoat out of thy flock is to offer unto him what is his own since all the beasts of the forest are his and so are the cattle upon a thousand hills i know says god all the fowls upon the mountains and the wild beasts of the field are in my sight if i be hungry i will not tell thee for the whole world is mine and all that is therein think thou that i will eat bulls flesh and drink the blood of goats then it follows as a full declaration of what sacrifice god is delighted with and a command moreover to perform the same offer unto god thanksgiving  nothing but supine indolence and the utmost indifference to things of a spiritual nature can make this duty so neglected among men and suffer the goodness of god to pass away with so little regard the mercies which he is pleased each day to confer upon us seem to have no other effect with the generality i mean that to make us confident of a succession of them the following day no other effect than to assist us in flattering ourselves that we are the peculiar people of god and to teach us to presume that he who has ever been mindful of us will ever continue to be so  yet this is not the whole of the case  for it is observable that those persons who are so unmindful of the blessings of god who permit such repeated instances of his mercy to slip out of their minds without any mention or acknowledgment of them are the first to complain and murmur if an accident disappoints their schemes and designs or any thing falls out contrary to their wishes and inclinations  surely this is a most notorious indication what strangers we are to god and the ways of his providence and how wholly our minds are busied and delighted with the affairs of this world  a signal act indeed of mercy a mark of gods special providence will raise in many men a sudden spirit of gratitude a certain warmth and eagerness to give praise unto god  but soon does that spirit subside  variety of diversions and hurry of business quickly damp that fire and introduce lukewarmness and indifference  but if the blessing received be remembered for a time it is often remembered in wanton gratitude expressed by unseemly mirth and jollity and most frequently ending in excess and intemperance  so evident is that truth that if the common and daily mercies of god cannot awaken in us a spirit of gratitude neither shall we be persuaded to a constant practice of this duty though the most extraordinary act of mercy were wrought in that behalf  thanksgiving is distinguished from praise as it is a more confined duty or rather a part of that general one  it has respect to those blessings and mercies which concern ourselves whereas praise terminates in god with regard to his own great and infinite perfections  thanksgiving consists in a grateful sense of any mercy we have received from god expressed by such outward signs as are most agreeable to our joy  it implies not only a present acknowledgment of his favors but such a constant remembrance of them that no worldly honors or success can deface or blot out of our minds  moreover it includes a due reflection on those favors and requires that we set a just value on them omitting no circumstance that may heighten their excellence  but this duty is best expressed when the mercies of god excite in us a love and reverence of his name and an hearty desire and sincere endeavor to present ourselves romans xii   a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto him  herein consists the duty of thanksgiving  how reasonable an one it is every man must at once confess when he considers to whom it is to be paid  to him who first gave and still continues our being  to him who has created all things in heaven and earth for our comfort and convenience  jam i   who gives liberally and upbraideth not requiring as a return for his kindness the acknowledgment of it and the performance of some duties that are by no means difficult to practice  whose providence watches over us at all times in every place and under all circumstances when we are rash and inconsiderate when we are careless and negligent and when we are buried in sleep and cannot so much as think how to secure ourselves or any thing belonging to us  who is so gracious as to call us his friends and under that endearing relation to admit us to a free intercourse with himself permitting us to call him father and to make known our requests unto him by prayer and supplication  who with an eye of pity beholds our sorrows relieves our wants assists our infirmities and sends us strength and patience to support ourselves under trials and afflictions  but above all who has sent his only begotten son from his own right hand into the world to take upon him our nature and its infirmities to die in our stead and by his death to make us inheritors of life and glory and who when through our manifold transgressions we provoke him to wrath at the intercession of his son does still forgive us and suffers not his displeasure to arise  there is one circumstance which must greatly recommend this duty to us and that is its excellence  we cannot pay a more acceptable service to our lord than thanksgiving a service which of all others he is most delighted with nay which he is pleased to distinguish in a very peculiar manner ps l    whosoever offers me thanks and praise he honors me honors god  how emphatically does this expression set forth the excellence of thanksgiving and graciously encourage us in the performance of the duty let it not then be termed a mercenary one let it not be construed to proceed from selfishness since there cannot be that principle in any mans heart who makes the utmost return he is able for a benefit received  no selfishness is the parent of ingratitude a sin most unpardonable in us and most detestable in the sight of god but thankfulness proceeds from another principle a principle of love derived to us from the fountain of love god himself  it is not an address of interest a petition to him for more blessings it is an humble acknowledgment of his excellent mercy and goodness in what he has already bestowed  the reasons and occasions of the duty must of necessity make it a pleasant one because the recollection of every mercy is a kind of second enjoyment we are assured by one who was very conversant in it that ib cxlvii   it is a joyful and pleasant thing to be thankful it must besides administer great delight to the mind as it enlarges its powers and raises it from low and trifling objects which darken and debase it to that great and noble one the divine being  such is the nature reasonableness and excellence of thanksgiving a duty required from and incumbent upon all since all have tasted of the mercies of god  the same obligations which affect every individual for the particular instances of kindness shown to him will respectively affect all communities and bodies of men and consequently all states and kingdoms  it must be confessed by ourselves and all others who are acquainted with our history that this nation has experienced the most sensible marks of the divine favor has been most signally and wonderfully preserved in times both of the greatest danger and most extreme necessity  the god of hosts has often gone out with us to battle   yea we had at this time received the welcome news of the taking the forts and castles of carthagena and were in expectation of soon hearing that the town itself was taken at this instant i speak with all due deference we have some reason to believe that ps cxxiv   the lord is on our side that he has most graciously answered our petitions and is see the additional prayer for the war gone forth with our fleets and armies  this is a mercy not which our fathers have told us but which we do now see and hear and which loudly calls for our most devout thanks to the author and with them our further prayers that he would be pleased to continue to us his favors and to preserve that great man who truly sollicitous for the public good left his ease and retirement to enter upon a painful and hazardous expedition who departed not in the spirit of revenge but with an heart full of courage and resolution equalled only by his prudence and moderation in whose generous and honest breast the love of his country appears to be the governing principle and who seems to rejoice that it has pleased god to make him the instrument of recovering its just rights of chastising a faithless and insolent enemy  after two rigorous winter seasons the first of which was very remarkable and a long excessive drought when our old stores were greatly exhausted and a most melancholy prospect before us it pleased god to send a great rain which was universal and has produced one of the most plentiful harvests ever known in this kingdom another mercy for which we at this time stand obliged to our gracious preserver is that glorious prospect of the fruits of the earth springing up to supply our present great necessity the effect only of his goodness ps lxviii   who sent a gracious rain on his inheritance and refreshed it when it was weary these are blessings which we are now sensible of and which require our sincerest thanks to the boutiful giver whom with all humility we are to wait on for a continuance of these mercies trusting that he will finish what he has begun that he will preserve us in our dangers abroad and our necessities at home that he will both ib exlvii    make peace in our borders and also fill us with the flour of wheat  the best method by which we can most reasonably hope to see our desires answered to behold the completion of these blessings is gratefully to acknowledge those instances of the divine goodness which were shown to us heretofore  of these none more deserves our best and heartiest thanks than the great deliverance of this day which it is to be hoped will be had in remembrance as long as that constitution shall last which was reestablishd by it  to remember this mercy is not the work of the lips but of the heart  it is to reflect with seriousness upon it to learn how to value it and to look into every circumstance that may help to show us the true value of it  it is to draw such inferences from it that may direct our practice and assist us in the several duties of life  to entertain from thence just notions of the relations we bear to each other and of the obligations arising from such relations  particularly to learn from thence obedience to the king and all that are put in authority under him to endeavor to preserve the peace and good order of the community in which we live to show good offices to our friends and neighbors and to bear a good will toward all men to restrain every inordinate and turbulent passion in our minds that may incline us to change or lead us beyond the bounds of equity truth and reason  above all to love and fear and honor him who is king of kings and lord of lords and to frequent the service of that church which his providence has established in these kingdoms  the blessing which we this day stand so greatly indebted to almighty god for is the having put an end to the great rebellion by the restitution of the king and royal family and the restoration of the government after many years interruption  to be sensible of the great value of this blessing we need only look into the history of that time and reflect on the anarchy and confusion that then overspread the whole nation  when that form of government which was so agreeable to the temper and constitution of the people and which was proved by the experience of many ages to be the best method of preserving to them their rights and privileges nay which the usurper himself confessed to be the best method of governing by instituting something of the like kind i say when that excellent form of government was destroyed no wonder that disorder was the consequence when judges xvii   there was no king in this our israel it is no matter of amazement that every man did that which was right in his own eyes  after that effusion of noble blood and the black unparalled murder of the best of kings how soon did oppression spread its dark wings over this unhappy nation how soon were those deluded men that were blindly led on by false and mischievous guides made sensible of their error and how quickly did they perceive that that liberty which they thirsted after even unto blood was only made a popular pretense to reduce them to the most abject slavery  thus being grossly deceived and by the most scandalous and false representations urged on through the most unwarrantable means to seek freedom did they plunge themselves into the very gulf of tyranny and madly striving to depose one that was imaginary suffered themselves to be evil entreated by many real tyrants  what envy injustice and bitterness of heart was there in every society what malice jealousy and suspicion what schemes and designs what plotting and contrivance each faction by all the methods and arts that the most fiery zeal could suggest striving for the superiority professing sincerity meekness and humility full of pride rage and perfidiousness  for how was the sacred name of religion then prostituted and the honor and service of god made a cloak to palliate the most enormous crimes made the means not only of practicing but justifying the most notorious instances of oppression and cruelty  surely more flagrant hypocrisy carried to greater heights and attended with stronger aggravations never yet appeared in the world an hypocrisy equal in every circumstance and character to that of the pharisees and well deserving those severe matt xx ii denuntiations pronounced against it by the mouth of truth  the faithful loyalist in the mean while deprived of all power all probable means of assisting or bringing back the king could only show his affection toward him in good wishes and inclinations which the excessive violence and fury of the prevailing party would not suffer to extend even to words the treachery of some compelled him to confine his thoughts to his own bosom as the avarice and rapine of others obliged him to conceal his substance where it was most likely to be secured  how grievous an heartbreaking must it have been to him to every man of old english principles first to behold a prince of so much goodness rudely seized on and inhumanly murdered by his own subjects then to see his son and the rest of the royal issue in their tender years drove from the kingdom the purest christian church overthrown and trampled on and private property no better secured than by faction and opinion  in this miserable situation of affairs some attempts were made toward a reestablishment but without success alas all human means were too weak to recover the peace of the kingdom to place so distracted a government on its ancient basis nothing matt xxiii but the hand of providence could effect so mighty a work and reconcile so many contending parties and jarring opinions twas not in the arm of flesh twas the peculiar only of god to cause those ezekiel xxxvii dried bones to live and it was he that did in his appointed time renew a right spirit within the people of this nation that did ibid xi    take away the stony heart out of their flesh and give them an heart of flesh twas through him alone that ibid xxxvi   this land that was desolate did become like the garden of eden and the wast and ruined cities become fenced and were inhabited  for this cause therefore let us dan iv    praise and extol and honor the king of heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment who did ps lxvi    suffer men to ride over our heads but at last brought us out into a wealthy place who in our troubles and adversities did turn and refresh us who remembered us in our low estate and turned away the captivity of his people  is there any one then among this people that will refuse to pay to almighty god his annual tribute of praise and thanksgiving for so wonderful a blessing  the man in whom the return of this day does not create joy and raise a spirit of gratitude would have looked upon the confusion that preceded the restoration with pleasure and complacency and what a friend to his country such an one is like to prove the meanest capacity may judge  every satisfaction we enjoy every new acquisition we make every thing that is dear to us more especially our religion and liberties are derived to us from thence  to be insensible therefore of this blessing were to act most absurdly indeed were to indicate that we are even enemies to our own selves  he whose licentious tongue instructed and directed by a wicked heart can rail at object against and vilify the truly happy day we are now remembering should consider if nothing else can stop his virulence and detraction that he is obliged to that days success for the very freedom of speech he is pleased so intemperately to make use of  i know not how far men may be carried by their humors and passions how far an affectation of singularity may incline some how far a spirit of party may compel others and how far indifference and the distance of time may be a cause in more of omitting this their sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving but this may be said with some degree of assurance that no one who has a due regard for the honor and dignity of the crown a tender concern and temperate zeal for the established church and an heart glowing with the love of liberty that no one can consistently with these principles neglect his duty on this day and be blameless  if a man will be searching for excuses the only possible method by which he can requit himself in this case is to doubt the truth of the fact a scheme which may not seem so full of absurdity if skepticism in history be as flagrant as it is in religion   neither do i see with what reason any one can insinuate himself into anothers favor by misrepresentations of the important transaction of that day and by depreciating the character of the king then restored with men of honest and generous principles it has ever been held a mark of a mean spirit to commend one man by aspersing another how much more then is it a sign of base servitude to extol one prince whose virtues are too well known to need such low helps at the expense of debasing another who wore the same crown before him it amounts to more than a supposition that he who can be guilty of such behavior would at a fit opportunity and under favorable circumstances turn a vile traitor and even whet his sword against the gracious sovereign now set over us as it is our duty to pay the greatest reverence to his sacred person so let the memory of the other be ever dear unto us of him who as on this day returned to his kingdom with the universal acclamations of his people rejoicing with one heart and united hands to see their ancient their best constitution restored to behold once again the glorious face of monarchy episcopacy and liberty  it has pleased god out of his abundant mercy to prolong the lives of some persons who were eyewitnesses of that happy day even to these times but had we no living evidence of it were the distance of time much greater than it is yet a mercy so signal and so excellent can never be forgotten by us we cannot without forfeiture of our reason omit religiously observing a day the joyful effects of which we are every moment sensible of more especially in this great and renowned city which the rest of the kingdom seem so industrious to copy after let this day be ever held sacred it were to degenerate from the spirit of our ancestors not to acknowledge that work with joy which they were so sollicitous about and which under the direction of providence they were so remarkably instrumental in bringing to pass  i would use one word more of exhortation which is that we take care to instill into those that come after the same sense of this mercy the same spirit of gratitude which we ourselves feel ps lxxviii   that posterity may know it and the children which are yet unborn to the intent that when they come up they may show their children the same josh iv   that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what means this appointed day and this solemn thanksgiving that you shall let your children know saying this land was defiled with blood the ancient and free government of this kingdom was overthrown and destroyed by wicked and bloodthirsty men and the lord delivered us from their hands by a stretched out arm ibid iv    that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord it is mighty and that ye might fear the lord your god for ever  the royal psalmist who had so often experienced the merciful goodness of the lord some passages of whose life the history of this day is exactly parallel to who was driven out of his kingdom by ungrateful and evilminded men and returned to it again with joy and great triumph will put a song of praise into the mouth of every man who has a just sense of this days mercy and reach him thus to express his thanks for it to almighty god  ps cxlv   i will magnify thee  god my king and praise thy name for ever  ever every day will i give thanks unto  and praise thy name for ever and ever great is the lord and mavelous worthy to be praised there is no end of his greatness ibid cxlvii   o sing unto the lord with thanksgiving sing praises upon the harp unto our god ps lxv   who stille the raging of the sea and the noise of hi waves and the madness of the people ibid cxlvii       praise the lord o jerusalem praise thy god o sion for he has made fast the bars of thy gates and has blessed thy children within thee ps cxlv    my mouth shall speak the praise of the lord and let all flesh give thanks unto his holy name for ever and ever  finis
