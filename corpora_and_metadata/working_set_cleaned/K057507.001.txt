a good paternal inheritance before he was five and thirty was reduced to live upon the moderate salary of a place at court which his friends procured him to get rid of his importunities the same imprudence by which he had been governed in affairs of less importance directed him likewise in the choice of a wife the woman he married had no merit but beauty and brought with her to the house of a man whose fortune was already ruined nothing but a taste for luxury and expense without the means of gratifying it  harriot the eldest daughter of this couple was like her mother a beauty and upon that account as well as the conformity of her temper and inclinations to hers engrossed all her affection  sophia she affected to despise because she wanted in an equal degree those personal attractions which in her opinion constituted the whole of female perfection mere common judges however allowed her person to be agreeable people of discernment and taste pronounced her something more there was diffused throughout the whole person of sophia a certain secret charm a natural grace which cannot be defined she was not indeed so beautiful as her sister but she was more attractive her complexion was not so fair as harriots nor her features so regular but together they were full of charms her eyes were particularly fine large and full of fire but that fire tempered with a tenderness so bewitching as insensibly made its way to the heart harriot had beauty but sophia had something more she had graces  one of the most beautiful fictions of homer says the celebrated montesquieu is that of the girdle which gave venus the power of pleasing nothing is more proper to give us an idea of the magic and force of the graces which seem to be given to a person by some invisible power and are distinguished from beauty itself  harriots charms produced at the first sight all the effect they were capable of a second look of sophia was more dangerous than the first for grace is seldomer found in the face than the manners and as our manner is formed every moment a new surprise is perpetually creating a woman can be beautiful but one way she can be graceful a thousand  harriot was formed to be the admiration of the many sophia the passion of the few the sweet sensibility of her countenance the powerful expression of her eyes the soft elegance of her shape and motion a melodious voice whose varied accents enforced the sensible things she always said were beauties not capable of striking vulgar minds and which were sure to be eclipsed by the dazzling luster of her sisters complexion and the fire of two bright eyes whose looks were as quick and unsettled as her thoughts  while harriot was receiving the improvement of a polite education sophia was left to form herself as well as she could happily for her a just taste and solid judgment supplied the place of teachers precept and example the hours that harriot wasted in dress company and gay amusements were by sophia devoted to reading  a good old gentleman who was nearly related to her father perceiving this taste in her encouraged it by his praises and furnished her with the means of gratifying it by constantly supplying her with such books as were best calculated to improve her morals and understanding his admiration increasing in proportion as he had opportunities of observing her merit he undertook to teach her the french and italian languages in which she soon made a surprising progress and by the time she had reached her fifteenth year she had read all the best authors in them as well as in her own  by this unwearied application to reading her mind became a beautiful storehouse of ideas hence she derived the power and the habit of constant reflection which at once enlarged her understanding and confirmed her in the principles of piety and virtue  as she grew older the management of the family entirely devolved upon her for her mother had no taste for any thing but pleasure and her sister was taught to consider herself as a fine lady whose beauty could not fail to make her fortune and whose sole care it ought to be to dress to the greatest advantage and make her appearance in every place where she might increase the number of her admirers  sophia in acquitting herself of the duties of a housekeeper to her mother showed that the highest intellectual improvements were not incompatible with the humbler cares of domestic life every thing that went through her hands received a grace and propriety from the good sense by which she was directed nor did her attention to familyaffairs break in upon her darling amusement reading  people who know how to employ their time well are good economists of it sophia laid out hers in such exact proportions that she had always sufficient for the several employments she was engaged in the business of her life like that of nature was performed without noise hurry or confusion  the death of mr darnley threw this little family into a deplorable state of indigence which was felt the more severely as they had hitherto lived in an affluence of all things and the debts which an expense so ill proportioned to their income had obliged mr darnley to contract left the unhappy widow and her children without any resource the plate furniture and every thing valuable were seized by the creditors mrs darnley and her daughters retired to a private lodging where the first days were passed in weak despondence on the part of the mother in passionate repinings on that of the eldest daughter and by sophia in decent sorrow and pious resignation  mrs darnley however by a natural consequence of her thoughtless temper soon recovered her former gaiety present evils only were capable of affecting her reflection and forecast never disturbed the settled calm of her mind if the wants of one day were supplied she did not consider what inconveniences the next might produce as for harriot she found resources of comfort in the exalted ideas she had of her own charms and having already laid it down as a maxim that poverty was the most shameful thing in the world she formed her resolutions accordingly  sophia as soon as her grief for the loss of her father had subsided began to consider of some plan for their future subsistence she forbore however to communicate her thoughts on this subject to her mother and sister who had always affected to treat every thing she said with contempt the mean disguise which envy had assumed to hide their consciousness of her superior merit but she opened her mind to the good old gentleman to whom she had been obliged for many of her improvements she told him that being by his generous cares qualified to undertake the education of a young lady she was desirous of being received into the family of some person of distinction in the quality of governess to the daughters of it that she might at once secure to herself a decent establishment and be enabled to assist her mother she hinted that if her sister could be also prevailed upon to enter into the service of a lady of quality they might jointly contribute their endeavors to make their mothers life comfortable  mr herbert praised her design and promised to mention it to mrs darnley to whom he conceived he might speak with the greater freedom as his near relation to her husband and the long friendship which had subsisted between them gave him a right to interest himself in their affairs the first words he uttered produced such an emotion in mrs darnleys countenance as convinced him that what he had farther to say would not be favorably received she colored drew herself up with an air of dignity looking at the same time at her eldest daughter with a scornful smile  mr herbert however continued his discourse when harriot with a pertness which she took for wit interrupted him by a loud laugh and asked him if going to service was the best provision he could think of for mr darnleys daughters  mr herbert turning hastily to her replied with a look of great gravity and in a calm accent have you miss thought of any thing better  harriot without being disconcerted retorted very briskly people who have nothing but advice to offer to their friends in distress ought to be silent till they are asked for it  good advice miss replied the old gentleman with the same composure is what every body cannot and many will not give and it is at least an instance of friendship to hazard it where one may be almost sure of its giving offense but continued he turning to sophia my young pupil here has i hope not profited so little by her reading as to be ignorant of the value of good counsel and i promise her she shall not only command the best that i am capable of giving but every other assistance she may stand in need of saying this he bowed and went away without any attempts from mrs darnley to detain him  poor sophia who was supposed by her silence to have acquiesced in the old gentlemans proposal was exposed to a thousand reproaches for her meanness of spirit she attempted to show the utility and even the necessity of following his advice but she found on this occasion as she had on many others that with some persons it is not safe to be reasonable her arguments were answered with rage and invective which soon silenced her and increased the triumph of her imperious sister  mr herbert apprehensive of the ill treatment she was likely to be exposed to offered to place her in the family of a country clergyman and to pay for her board till such a settlement as she desired could be procured for her but the tender sophia not willing to leave her mother while she could be of any use to her gratefully declined his offer still expecting that the increasing perplexity of their circumstances might bring her to relish his reasonable counsels and that she might have the sanction of her consent to a step which prudence made necessary to be taken  a legacy of a hundred pounds being left her by a young lady who tenderly loved her and who died in her arms she immediately presented it to her mother by whom it was received with a transport of joy but without any reflection upon the filial piety of her who gave it  sophias good friend though he did not absolutely approve of this exalted strain of tenderness yet did not fail to place the merit of it in the fullest light but harriot who never heard any praises of her sister without a visible emotion interrupted him by saying that sophia had only done what she ought and that she herself would have acted in the same manner if the sum had been twenty times larger  the same delicacy which induced sophia to divest herself of any particular right to this small legacy made her see the misapplication of it without discovering the least mark of dislike harriot who governed her mother absolutely having represented to her that the obscurity in which they lived was not the means to preserve their old friends or to acquire new ones and that it was their business to appear again in the world and put themselves in the way of fortune which could not be done without making a decent appearance at least mrs darnley who thought this reasoning unanswerable consented to their changing their present lodgings for others more genteel and to whatever expenses her eldest daughter judged necessary to secure the success of her scheme  sophia lamented in secret this excess of imprudence and to avoid being a witness of it as well as to free her mother from the expense of her maintenance she resolved to accept of the first genteel place that offered but the natural softness and timidity of her temper made her delay as long as possible mentioning this design to her mother and sister lest it should be construed into a tacit reproach of them for a conduct so very different  indeed her condition was greatly altered for the worse since the present she had made of her legacy her mother and sister had never loved her with any great degree of affection and their tenderness for her was now entirely lost in the uneasy consciousness of having owed an obligation to her for which they could not resolve to be grateful they no longer considered her as an insignificant person whose approbation or dislike was of no sort of consequence but as a saucy censurer of their actions who assumed to herself a superiority on account of the paultry assistance she had afforded them every thing she said was construed into upbraidings of the benefit she had conferred upon them if she offered her opinion upon any occasion harriot would say to her with a malicious sneer to be sure you think you have a right to give us laws because we have had the misfortune to be obliged to you and mrs darnley working herself up to an agony of grief and resentment for the fancied insult would lift up her eyes and cry how much is that mother to be pitied who lives to receive alms from her child  poor sophia used to answer no otherwise than by tears but this was sure to aggravate her fault for it was supposed that she wept and appeared afflicted only to show people what ungrateful returns she met with for her goodness  thus did the unhappy sophia with the softest sensibility of heart and tenderest affections see herself excluded from the endearing testimonies of a mothers fondness only by being too worthy of them and exposed to shocking suspicions of undutifulness for an action that showed the highest filial affection so true it is that great virtues cannot be understood by mean and little minds and with such not only lose all their luster but are too often mistaken for the contrary vices  chap ii the triumph of the graces while sophia passed her time in melancholy reflections harriot being by her generous gift enabled to make as shewy an appearance as her mourning habit would permit again mixed in company and laid baits for admiration her beauty soon procured her a great number of lovers her poverty made their approaches easy and the weakness of her understanding her insipid gaiety and pert affectation of wit encouraged the most licentious hopes and exposed her to the most impertinent addresses  among those who looking upon her as a conquest of no great difficulty formed the mortifying design of making a mistress of her was sir charles stanley a young baronet of a large estate a most agreeable person and engaging address his fine qualities made him the delight of all who knew him and even envy itself allowed him to be a man of the strictest honor and unblemished integrity  persons who connect the idea of virtue and goodness with such a character would find it hard to conceive how a man who lives in a constant course of dissimulation with one part of his species and who abuses the advantages he has received from nature and fortune in subduing chastity and ensnaring innocence can possibly deserve and establish a reputation for honor but such are the illusions of prejudice and such the tyranny of custom that he who is called a man of gallantry is at the same time esteemed a man of honor though gallantry comprehends the worst kind of fraud cruelty and injustice  sir charles stanley had been but too successful in his attempts upon beauty to fear being rejected by miss darnley and knowing her situation he resolved to engage her gratitude at least before he declared his designs he had interest enough to procure the place her father enjoyed for a gentleman who thought himself happy in obtaining it though charged with an annuity of fourscore pounds a year for the widow of his predecessor  sir charles in acquainting miss darnley with what he had done in favor of her mother found himself under no necessity of insinuating his motive for the extraordinary interest he took in the affairs of this distressed family harriots vanity anticipated any declaration of this sort and the thanks she gave him were accompanied with such an apparent consciousness of the power of her charms as convinced him his work was already more than half done  he was now received at mrs darnleys in the quality of a declared lover of harriot and although amidst all his assiduities he never mentioned marriage either the mother and daughter did not penetrate into his real designs or were but too much disposed to favor them  the innocent heart of sophia was at first overwhelmed with joy for the happy provision that had been made for her mother and the prospect of such an advantageous match for her sister when mr herbert who knew the world too well to be imposed upon by these fine appearances gently hinted to his young favorite his apprehensions of the baronets dishonorable views  her delicacy was so shocked by this suspicion that she could scarce forbear expressing some little resentment of it but reflecting that this ardent lover of harriots had not yet made any proposals of marriage her good sense immediately suggested to her that such affected delays in a man who was absolutely independent and with a woman whose situation made it a point of delicacy to be early explicit on that head could only proceed from intentions which he had not yet dared to own  chance had so ordered it that hitherto she had never seen sir charles stanley whenever he came she was either employed in the family affairs or engaged with her books which it was no easy matter to make her quit besides as she had no share in his visits and as her sister never showed any inclination to introduce her to him she thought it did not become her to intrude herself upon his acquaintance sir charles indeed knowing that mrs darnley had another daughter used sometimes to enquire for her but was neither surprised nor disappointed that she never appeared  sophia however was determined to be in the way when he came next that she might have an opportunity of observing his behavior to her sister and fondly flattered herself that she should discover nothing to the disadvantage of a person whom her grateful heart had taught itself to love and esteem as their common benefactor  sir charles at the next visit found sophia in the room with her sister he instantly saw something in her looks and person which inspired him with more respect than he had been used to feel for mrs darnley and harriot a dignity which she derived from innate virtue and exalted understanding struck with that inexplicable charm in her countenance which made it impossible to look on her with indifference he began to consider her with an attention which greatly disgusted harriot who could not conceive that where she was present any other object was worthy notice  sophia herself was a little disconcerted by the young baronets so earnestly gazing on her and in order to divert his looks opened a conversation in which her sister might bear a part then it was that without designing it she displayed her whole power of charming that flow of wit which was so natural to her the elegant propriety of her language the delicacy of her sentiments the animated look which gave them new force and sent them directly to the heart and the moving graces of the most harmonious voice in the world were attractions which though generally lost on fools seldom fail of their effect on the heart of a man of sense  sir charles was wrapped in wonder and delight he had no eyes no ears but for sophia he scarce perceived that harriot was in the room  the insolent beauty astonished at such unusual neglect varied her attitude and her charms a thousand different ways to draw his attention but found all was to no purpose had she been capable of serious reflection she might now have discovered what advantages her sister though inferior to her in beauty gained over her by the force of her understanding she might now have seen how beauty is excelled by modest grace and wisdom which alone is truly fair but too ignorant to know her own wants and too conceited to imagine she had any she was strangely perplexed how to account for so sudden an alteration in sir charles  her uneasiness however grew so great that she was not able to conceal it she shifted her seat two or three times in a minute bit her lips almost through and frowned so intelligibly that sophia at last perceiving her agitation suddenly recollected herself and quitted the room upon pretense of business  when she was gone harriot drawing herself up and assuming a look which expressed her confidence in the irresistible power of her charms seemed resolved to make her lover repent the little notice he had taken of her in this visit by playing off a thousand scornful airs upon him but she was more mortified than ever when upon turning her eyes toward him in full expectation of finding his fixed upon her she saw them bent upon the ground and such a pensiveness in his countenance as all her rigors could never yet occasion  she was considering what to say to him to draw him out of this reverie when sir charles on a sudden raising his eyes turned them toward the door with a look of mingled anxiety and impatience and then as if disappointed sighed and addressed some indifferent conversation to harriot  the lady now quite provoked had recourse to an artifice which her shallow understanding suggested to her as an infallible method of awakening his tenderness and this was to make him jealous without any preparation therefore she introduced the name of lord l  a young nobleman who was just returned from his travels and lavishing a thousand encomiums upon his person and his elegant taste in dress added that he was the best bred man in the world and had entertained her so agreeably one night at the play when happening to come into a box where she was with a lady of her acquaintance that they did not mind a word the players said he was so diverting  sir charles coldly answered that lord l  was a very pretty youth and that he was intimately acquainted with him  oh then cried harriot with a great deal of affected joy i vow and protest you shall bring him to see me  indeed you must excuse me madam said sir charles with some quickness  harriot concluding her stratagem had taken effect was quite transported and renewed her attacks determined to make him suffer as much as possible but the young baronet whose thoughts were full of sophia and whose emotion at the request harriot had made him was occasioned by fears very different from those she suspected took no further notice of what she said but interrupted her to ask how old her sister sophia was  i dare engage replied harriot you would never have supposed her to be younger than i am  the baronet smiled and looking at his watch seemed surprised that it was so late and took his leave  miss darnley following him to the door of the room cried remember i lay my commands upon you to bring my lord l  to see me  sir charles answered her no otherwise than by a low bow and she returned delighted at the parting pang which she supposed she had given him vanity is extremely ingenious in procuring gratifications for itself  chap iii the young baronet declares his passion harriot did not doubt but that she had tormented sir charles sufficiently and it was the unshaken confidence which she had in the power of her charms that hindered her from discovering the true cause of the new disgust she had conceived for her sister however it was so great that she could scarcely speak to her civilly or endure her in her sight yet she found an increase of pleasure in talking to her mother when she was present of the violent passion sir charles stanley had for her and in giving an exaggerated account of the professions he made her  sophia did not listen to this sort of discourse with her usual complaisance her mind became insensibly more disposed to suspect the sincerity of the baronets passion for her sister she grew pensive and melancholy sought solitude more than ever and loved reading less  this change which her own innocence hid from herself was quickly perceived by mr herbert who loved her with a parents fondness and thought nothing indifferent which concerned her he took occasion one day to mention sir charles stanley to her and asked her opinion of his person and understanding keeping his eyes fixed upon her at the same time which disconcerted her so much that she blushed and though she commended him greatly yet it was easy to discover that she forbore to say all the good she thought of him for fear of saying too much  mr herbert no longer doubted but this dangerous youth had made an impression on the innocent heart of sophia which was still ignorant of its own emotions  he had perceived for some time that sir charles had changed the object of his pursuits his visits now were always short unless sophia was in the way he brought her all the new books and pamphlets that were published which were worth her reading he adopted the purity and delicacy of her sentiments declared himself always of the side she espoused he talked of virtue like a man who loved and practiced it and set all his own good qualities in the fairest light he presented harriot from time to time with fashionable trifles and sent sophia books enough to furnish out a little library consisting of the best authors in english french and italian all elegantly bound with proper cases for their reception he praised whatever she approved and appeared to have great respect and consideration for mr herbert because he observed she loved and esteemed him  that faithful friend of the virtuous sophia trembled for her danger when he considered that by this artful management the baronet was strengthening himself every day in her good opinion and seducing her affections under the appearance of meriting her esteem yet he did not think it proper to give her even a hint of her situation a young maid has passed over the first bounds of reservedness who allows herself to think she is in love  mr herbert would not familiarize her with so dangerous an idea he knew her extreme modesty her solid virtue he was under no apprehensions that she would ever act unworthy of her character but a heart so nicely sensible so delicately tender as hers he knew must suffer greatly from a disappointed passion and this was what he wanted to prevent not by wounding her delicacy with suggesting to her that she was in love but by preserving her from the secret encroachments of that passion  he reminded her of the design she had formerly mentioned to him of entering into the service of a lady and was rejoiced to find that she still continued her resolution harriots natural insolence and ill temper irritated by the change she now plainly saw in sir charles made home so disagreeable to sophia that she wished impatiently for an opportunity of providing for herself that she might no longer live upon the bounty of her sister who often insinuated that their mothers annuity was her gift  mr herbert who had other reasons besides those urged from freeing her from so uneasy a dependence promised to be diligent in his enquiries for something that would suit her  neither mrs darnley nor harriot now opposed this design which soon came to the knowledge of sir charles who had bribed a servant of the family to give him intelligence of every thing that passed in it  impatient to prevent the execution of it and tortured by the bare apprehension of sophias absence he resolved to break through that constraint he had so long laid upon himself and acquaint her with his passion  but it was not easy to find an opportunity of speaking to her alone at length having contrived to get harriot engaged to a play and prevailed upon a maiden kinswoman of his to invite mrs darnley to a party at whist he went to the house at his usual hour of visiting this little family and found sophia at home and without any company  not all the confidence he derived from his rank and fortune his fine understanding and those personal graces which gave him but too much merit in the eyes of many women could hinder him from trembling at the thought of that declaration he was about to make  as soon as he came into sophias presence he was awed disconcerted and unable to speak such was the power of virtue and such the force of a real passion two or three times he resolved to begin but when he looked upon sophia and saw in her charming eyes that sparkling intelligence which displayed the treasures of the soul that animated them when he observed the sweet severity of her modest countenance the composed dignity of her behavior he durst not own a passion which had views less pure than the perfect creature that inspired it  his conversation for near an hour was so confused so disjointed and interrupted by such frequent mufings that sophia was amazed and thought it so disagreeable and unlike what it used to be that she was not sorry when he seemed disposed to put an end to his visit  sir charles indeed rose up to be gone but with so deep a concern in his eyes as increased sophias perplexity she attended him respectfully to the door of the room when he suddenly turning back and taking her hand do not hate me said he nor think ill of me if i tell you that i love and adore you  sophia in the utmost confusion at such a speech disengaged her hand from his and retiring a few steps back bent her eyes on the ground and continued silent  sir charles emboldened by her confusion made a tender and at the same time respectful declaration of the passion he had long felt for her  sophia not willing to hear him enlarge upon this subject raised her eyes from the ground her cheeks were indeed overspread with blushes but there was a grave composure in her looks that seemed a bad omen to sir charles  i have hitherto flattered myself sir said she that you entertained a favorable opinion of me how happens it then that i see myself today exposed to your raillery  the baronet was beginning a thousand protestations but sophia stopped him short if your professions to me are sincere said she what am i to think of those you made to my sister  sir charles expected this retort and was the less perplexed by it as he needed only to follow the dictates of truth to form such an answer as was proper to be given i acknowleged said he that i admired your sister and her beauty made as strong an impression upon me as mere beauty can make upon a man who has a taste for higher excellencies i sought miss darnleys acquaintance i was so happy as to do her some little service i wished to find in her those qualities that were necessary to fix my heart  pardon my freedom miss sophia the occasion requires that i should speak freely miss darnley upon a nearer acquaintance did not answer the idea i had formed to myself of a woman whom i could love for life and the professions i made her as you are pleased to call them were no more than expressions of gallantry a sort of homage which beauty even when it does not touch the heart exacts from the tongue my heart was not so easy a conquest  tell me not of raillery when i declare that none but yourself was ever capable of inspiring me with a real passion  the arrival of mr herbert proved a grateful interruption to sophia in whose innocent breast the tenderness and apparent sincerity of this declaration raised emotions which she knew not how to disguise  sir charles though grieved at this unseasonable visit yet withdrew not wholly despairing of success he had heedfully observed the changes in sophias face while he was speaking and thought he had reason to hope that he was not indifferent to her loving her as he did with excessive tenderness what pure and unmixed satisfaction would this thought have given him had he not been conscious that his designs were unworthy of her the secret upbraidings of his conscience disquieted him amidst all his flattering hopes of success but custom prejudice the insolence of fortune and the force of example all conspired to suppress the pleadings of honor and justice in favor of the amiable sophia and fixed him in the barbarous resolution of attempting to corrupt that virtue which made her so worthy of his love  chap iv in which harriot makes a very contemptible figure mr herbert having as has been already mentioned interrupted the conversation between sir charles and sophia was not surprised at the young baronets abrupt departure as he seemed preparing to go when he came in but upon looking at sophia he perceived so many signs of confusion and perplexity in her countenance that he did not doubt but the discourse which his entrance had put an end to had been a very interesting one he waited a moment in expectation that she would open herself to him but finding that she continued silent and abashed he gently took her hand and looking tenderly upon her tell me my child said he has not something extraordinary happened which occasions this confusion i see you in  sir charles has indeed been talking to me replied sophia blushing in a very extraordinary manner and such as i little expected  mr herbert pressed her to explain herself and she gave him an exact account of sir charless discourse to her without losing a word so faithful had her memory been to all he had said  mr herbert listened to her attentively and found something so like candor and sincerity in the baronets declaration that he could not help being pleased with it he had never indeed judged favorably of his views upon harriot but here the case was very different  harriots ignorance vanity and eager desire of being admired exposed her to the attacks of libertinism and excited presumptuous hopes  sophias good sense modesty and virtue placed her out of the reach of temptation no one could think it surprising that a man of sense should make the fortune of a woman who would do honor to his choice and where there was such exalted merit as in sophia overlook the disparity of circumstances  but justly might it be called infatuation and folly to raise to rank and affluence a woman of harriots despicable turn to make a companion for life of a handsome idiot who thought the highest excellencies of the female character were to know how to dress to dance to sing to flutter in a drawing room or coquet at a play who mistook pertness for wit confidence for knowledge and insolence for dignity  while he was revolving these thoughts in his mind sophia looked earnestly at him pleased to observe that what the baronet had said seemed worthy his consideration  mr herbert who read in her looks that she wished to have his advice on this occasion but would not ask it lest she should seem to lay any stress upon sir charless declaration told her it was very possible the baronet was sincere in what he had said to her that his manner of accounting for his quitting her sister was both sensible and candid that she ought not to be surprised at the preference he gave her over miss darnley since she deserved it by the care she had taken to improve her mind and to acquire qualities which might procure the esteem of all wise and virtuous persons  he warned her however not to trust too much to favorable appearances nor to suffer her inclinations to be so far engaged by the agreeable person and specious behavior of sir charles stanley as to find it painful to renounce him if he should hereafter show himself unworthy of her good opinion  he advised her when he talked to her in the same strain again to refer him to her mother and to him for an answer and told her that he would save her the confusion and perplexity of acquainting her mother and sister with what had happened by taking that task upon himself  you will no doubt added he be exposed to some sallies of ill temper from miss darnley for robbing her of a lover for envy is more irreconcilable than hatred but let not your sensibility suffer much on her account if you deprive her of a lover you do not deprive her of one she loves she is too vain too volatile and too greedy of general admiration to be affected with the loss of sir charles any farther than as her pride is wounded by it and one would imagine she had foreseen this desertion by the pains she has taken about a new conquest lately  mr herbert was going on when mrs darnley knocked at the door sophia in extreme agitation begged him to say nothing concerning sir charles that evening he promised her he would not and they all three conversed together upon indifferent things until harriot returned from the play  mr herbert then took leave of them after inviting himself to breakfast the next morning which threw sophia into such terror and confusion that she retired hastily to her own room to conceal her disorder  mr herbert came the next morning according to his promise and sophia all trembling with her apprehensions retiring immediately after breakfast he entered upon the business that had brought him thither but sensible that what he had to say would prove extremely mortifying to miss harriot he thought it not amiss to sweeten the bitter bill he was preparing for her by sacrificing a little flattery to her pride  you fine ladies said he addressing himself to her with a smile are never weary of extending your conquests but you use your power with so much tyranny that it is not surprising some of your slaves should assume courage at last to break your chains do you know my pretty cousin that you have lost sir charles stanley and that he has offered that heart which you no doubt have despised to your sister sophia  miss darnley who had bridled up at the beginning of this speech lost all her assumed dignity toward the end of it her face grew pale and red by turns she fixed her eyes on the ground her bosom heaved with the violence of her agitations and tears in spite of her were ready to force their way  sir charles had indeed for a long time discontinued his addresses to her and had suffered his inclination for her sister to appear plainly enough but still her vanity suggested to her that this might be all a feint and acted only with a view to alarm her fears and oblige her to sacrifice all her other admirers to him  what mr herbert had said therefore struck her at first with astonishment and grief but solicitous to maintain the fancied superiority of her character she endeavored to repress her emotions and taking the hint which he had designedly thrown out to her to save her confusion  sir charles has acted very wisely said she putting on a scornful look to quit me who always despised him for one who has been so little used to have lovers that she will be ready to run mad with joy at the thoughts of such a conquest but after all she has only my leavings  mr herbert though a little shocked at the grossness of her language replied gravely however that may be miss it is certain that he has made a very open and to all appearance sincere declaration of love to miss sophia who not knowing how to mention this affair to her mother herself commissioned me to acquaint her with it that she may have directions how to behave to sir charles and what to say to him  one would have imagined interrupted miss darnley eagerly that she who sets up for so much wit and reads so many books might have known what to say to him  pray miss said mr herbert what would you have had her say to sir charles  why truly replied she i think she ought to have told him that he was very impertinent and have shown him the door  sure harriot said mrs darnley who had been silent all this time you forget that sir charles is our benefactor and that i am obliged to him for all the little support i have  it is not likely i should forget it retorted miss darnley since i am the person who am most obliged to him for what he has done if i mistake not it was upon my account that he interested himself in our affairs  well well harriot replied mrs darnley i have been told this often enough but why should you be angry at this prospect of your sisters advancement  i angry at her advancement madam exclaimed miss harriot not i really i wish the girl was provided for by a suitable match with all my heart but as for sir charles i would not have her set her foolish heart upon him he is only laughing at her  it may be so said mr herbert though i think miss sophia the last woman in the world whom a man would choose to laugh at however this affair is worth a little consideration  miss sophia madam pursued he addressing himself to mrs darnley intends to refer sir charles entirely to you you will be the best judge whether the passion he professes is sincere and his intentions honorable and i can answer for my young cousin that she will be wholly governed by your advice since it is impossible that you can give her any but what is most advantageous to her honor and happiness  harriot no longer able to suppress her rage and envy was thrown so far off her guard as to burst into tears i cannot bear to be thus insulted cried she and i declare if sir charles is permitted to go on with his foolery with that vain girl i will quit the house  was there ever any one so unreasonable as you are miss said mr herbert have you not owned that you despised sir charles and if your sister is a vain girl will she not be sufficiently mortified by accepting your leavings as you said just now  i am speaking to my mother sir replied harriot with a contemptuous frown depend upon it madam pursued she that i will not stay to be sacrificed to mr herberts favorite  either she shall be forbid to give sir charles any encouragement who after all is only laughing at her or i will leave the house  saying this she flung out of the room leaving her mother divided between anger and grief and mr herbert motionless with astonishment  chap v sir charles by a proper degree of address and assurance extricates himself from a very pressing difficulty mr herbert having recovered from the astonishment into which he had been thrown by the strange behavior of miss darnley endeavored to comfort her mother whose weak mind was more disposed to be alarmed at the threat she had uttered upon her quitting the room than to resent such an insult to parental tenderness  after gently insinuating to her that she ought to reduce her eldest daughter to reason by a proper exertion of her authority he earnestly recommended to her to be particularly attentive to an affair which concerned the happiness of her youngest child from whose piety and good sense she might promise herself so much comfort  he advised her to give sir charles stanley an opportunity of explaining himself to her as soon as possible and to make him comprehend that he must not hope for permission to pay his addresses to sophia till he had satisfied her that his intentions were such as she ought to approve  mrs darnley appeared so docile and complaisant upon this occasion so ready to take advice and so fully determined to be directed by it that mr herbert went away extremely well satisfied with her behavior and full of pleasing hopes for his beloved sophia  harriot in the mean time was tormenting her sister above stairs she had entered her room with a heart full of bitterness and a countenance inflamed with rage throwing the door after her with such violence that sophia letting fall her book started up in great terror and in a trembling accent asked what was the matter with her  her own apprehensions had indeed already suggested to her the cause of the disorder she appeared to be in which it was not easy to discover in that torrent of reproach and invective with which she strove to overwhelm her scornful and unjust reflections upon her person bitter jests upon her pedantic affectation and malignant insinuations of hypocrisy were all thrown out with the utmost incoherence of passion to which sophia answered no otherwise than by a provoking serenity of countenance and the most calm attention  that she was able to bear with such moderation the cruel insults of her sister was not more the effect of her natural sweetness of temper than her good sense and delicate turn of mind the upper region of the air says a sensible french writer admits neither clouds nor tempests the thunder storms and meteors are formed below such is the difference between a mean and an exalted understanding  harriot who did not find her account in this behavior sought to rouse her rage by reproaches still more severe till having ineffectually railed herself out of breath she aukwardly imitated her sisters composure folded her hands before her and seating herself asked her in a low but solemn tone of voice whether she would deign to answer her one plain question  sophia then resuming her seat told her with a look of mingled dignity and sweetness that she was ready to answer her any question and give her any satisfaction she could desire provided she would repress those indecent transports of anger so unbecoming her sex and years  why you little envious creature said harriot you do not surely because you are two or three years younger than i am pretend to insinuate that i am old  no certainly replied sophia half smiling my meaning is that you are too young to adopt as you do all the peevishness of old age but your question sister pursued she   well then said harriot i ask you how you have dared to say that sir charles stanley was tired of me and preferred you to me  tired of you repeated sophia shocked at her coarseness and falsehood i never was capable of making use of such an expression nor do i familiarize myself with ideas that need such strange language to convey them  harriot provoked almost to frenzy by this hint which her indiscreet conduct made but too just flew down stairs to her mother and with mingled sobs and exclamations told her that sophia had treated her like an infamous creature who had dishonored herself and her family  mrs darnley though more favorably disposed toward her youngest daughter since she had been made acquainted with the baronets affection for her yet was on this occasion governed by her habitual preference of harriot and sending for sophia she reproved her with great asperity for her insolent behavior to her sister  sophia listened with reverence to her mothers reproofs and after justifying herself as she easily might from the accusation her sister had brought against her she added that not being willing to be exposed to any farther persecutions on account of sir charles stanley whose sincerity she thought very doubtful she was resolved not to wait any longer for a place such as mr herberts tenderness was in search of for her but to accept the first reputable one that offered  i have not the vanity madam pursued she to imagine that a man of rank and fortune can seriously resolve to marry an indigent young woman like me and although i am humble enough to go to service i am too proud to listen to the addresses of any man who from his superiority of fortune thinks he has a right to keep me in doubt of his intentions or in a mean dependence upon a resolution which he has not perhaps regard enough for me to make  this discourse was not all relished by mrs darnley who conceived that many inconveniences were to be submitted to for the enjoyment of affluence and pleasure but sophia who had revolved in her mind all the mortifications a young woman is exposed to whose poverty places her so greatly below her lover that she is to consider his professions as an honor and be rejoiced at every indication of his sincerity her delicacy was so much wounded by the bare apprehension of suffering what she thought an indignity to her sex that she was determined to give sir charles stanley no encouragement but to pursue her first design of seeking a decent establishment suitable to the depressed state of her fortune  mrs darnley however combatted her resolution with arguments which she supposed absolutely conclusive and added to them her commands not to think any more of so humiliating a design which so offended harriot that she broke out again into tears exclamations and reproaches  her mother would have found it a difficult task to have pacified her had not a message from a lady inviting her to a concert that evening obliged her to calm her mind that her complexion might not suffer from those emotions of rage which she had hitherto taken no pains to repress  as soon as harriot retired to begin the labors of the toilet mrs darnley with great mildness represented to sophia that it was her duty to improve the affection sir charles expressed for her since by that means it might be in her power to make her mother and her sister easy in their circumstances and engage their love for ever  this was attacking sophia on her weak side she answered with the softest tenderness of look and accent that it was her highest ambition to make them happy  then i do not doubt my child said mrs darnley but you will employ all your good sense to secure the conquest you have made  sophia melted almost to tears by these tender expressions to which she had been so little used assured her mother she would upon this occasion act in such a manner as to deserve her kindness  mrs darnley would have been better pleased if she had been less reserved and had appeared more affected with the fine prospect that was opening for her but it was not possible to press her farther nature here had transferred the parents rights to the child and the gay imprudent ambitious mother stood awed and abashed in the presence of her worthier daughter  sophia who expected sir charles would renew his visit in the evening past the rest of the day in uneasy perturbations he entered the house just at the time that harriot who had ordered a chair to be got for her came fluttering down the stairs in full dress as soon as she perceived him her cheeks glowed with resentment but affecting a careless inattention she shot by him with a half courtesy and made toward the door he followed and accosting her with a grave but respectful air desired she would permit him to lead her to her chair harriot conveying all the scorn into her face which the expression of her pretty but unmeaning features were capable of and rudely drawing away her hand pray sir said she carry your devores where they will be more acceptable i am not disposed to be jested with any longer  sir charles halfsmiling and bowing low told her that he respected her too much as well upon her own account as upon miss sophias for whom indeed he had the most tender regard to be guilty of the impertinence she accused him of  harriot did not stay to hear more offended in the highest degree at the manner in which he mentioned sophia she darted an angry look at him and flung herself into her chair  it must be confessed that sir charles discovered upon this occasion a great share of that easy confidence which people are apt to derive from splendid fortunes and undisputed rank but as he wanted neither good sense generosity nor even delicacy he would have found it difficult to own to a lady whom he had been used to address in the style of a lover that his heart had received a new impression if the contemptible character of harriot had not authorized his desertion of her pride ignorance folly and affectation sink a woman so low in the eyes of men that they easily dispense with themselves from a strict observance of those delicate attentions and respectful regards which the sex in general claim by the laws of politeness but which sense and discernment never pay to the trifling part of it  sir charles was likewise glad of an opportunity to show miss darnley that he did not think the little gallantry which had passed between them entitled her to make him any reproaches or to consider the passion he professed for her sister as an infidelity to her and now finding himself more at ease from the frank acknowledgement he had made he sent up his name and was received by mrs darnley with all the officious civility she was used to show him  sophia was in the room and rose up at his entrance in a sweet confusion which she endeavored to conceal by appearing extremely busy at a piece of needle work  sir charles after some trifling conversation with her mother approached her and complimented her with an easy air upon her being so usefully employed when most other young ladies were abroad in search of amusement  sophia who was now a little recovered answered him with that wit and vivacity which was so natural to her but looking up at the same time she saw his eyes fixed upon her with a look so tender and passionate as threw her back into all her former confusion which increased every moment by the consciousness that it was plain to his observation  the young baronet though he was charmed with her amiable modesty yet endeavored to relieve the concern he saw her under by talking of indifferent matters till mrs darnley seeing them engaged in discourse prudently withdrew when he instantly addressed her in language more tender and particular  sophia shocked at her mothers indiscretion and at his taking advantage of it so abruptly let all the weight of her resentment fall on him and the poor lover was so awed by her frowns and the sarcastic raillery which she mingled with expressions that showed the most invincible indifference that not daring to continue a discourse which offended her and in too great concern to introduce another subject he stood fixed in silence for several minutes leaning on the back of her chair while she plied her needle with the most earnest attention and felt her confusion decrease in proportion as his became more apparent  at length he walked slowly to the other end of the room and taking up a new book which he had sent her a few days before he asked her opinion of it in a faultering accent and was extremely mortified to find she was so much at ease as to answer him with all the readiness of wit and clearness of judgment imaginable  another pause of silence ensued during which sophia heard him sigh softly several times while he turned over the leaves of the book with such rapidity as showed he scarce read a single line in any page of it  he was thus employed when mrs darnley returned who stood staring first at one then at the other strangely perplexed at their looks and silence and apprehensive that all was not right sophia now took an opportunity to retire and met an angry glance from her mother as she passed by her  her departure roused sir charles out of his revery he looked after her and then turning to mrs darnley overcame his discontent so far as to be able to entertain her a quarter of an hour with his usual politeness and finding sophia did not appear again he took his leave  as soon as he was gone mrs darnley called her daughter and chid her severely for her rudeness in leaving the baronet  sophia defended herself as well as she could without owning the true cause of her disgust which was her mothers so officiously quitting the room but mrs darnley was so ill satisfied with her behavior that she complained of it to her friend mr herbert who came in soon afterward telling him that sophias pride and ill temper would be the ruin of her fortune  the good man having heard the story but one way thought sophia a little to blame till having an opportunity to discourse with her freely he found the fault she had been charged with was no more than an excess of delicacy which was very pardonable in her situation he warned her however not to admit too readily apprehensions injurious to herself which was in some degree debasing the dignity of her sex and character but to make the baronet comprehend that esteeming him as a man of honor she considered his professions of regard to her as a claim upon her gratitude and that in consequence she should without any reluctance receive the commands of her mother and the advice of her friends in his favor  chap vi sophia entertains hopes and becomes more unhappy poor sophia found herself but too well disposed to think favorably of sir charles her tenderness had suffered greatly by the force she had put upon herself to behave to him in so disobliging a manner and the uneasiness she saw him under his silence and confusion and the sighs that escaped him apparently without design had affected her sensibly and several days passing away without his appearing again she concluded he was irrecoverably prejudiced against her the uneasiness this thought gave her first hinted to herself the impression he had already made on her heart  sir charles indeed has been so much piqued by her behavior as to form the resolution of seeing her no more but when he supposed himself most capable of persisting in this resolution he was nearest breaking through it and suddenly yielding to the impulse of his tenderness he flew to her again more passionate than ever this little absence having only served to show him how necessary she was to his happiness when sophia saw him enter the room the agitations of her mind might be easily read in her artless countenance a sentiment of joy for his return gave new fire to her eyes and vivacity to her whole person while a consciousness of the effect his presence produced and a painful doubt of his sincerity and the rectitude of his intentions alternately dyed her cheeks with blushes and paleness  the young baronet approached her trembling but the unexpected softness with which she received him increasing at once his passion and his hopes he poured out his whole soul in the tenderest and most ardent professions of love esteem and admiration of her  sophia listened to him with a complaisant attention and having had sufficient time while he was speaking to compose and recollect herself she told him in a modest but firm accent that she was obliged to him for the favorable opinion he entertained of her but that she did not think herself at liberty to hear much less to answer to such discourse as he had thought proper to address to her till she had the sanction of her mothers consent and mr herberts approbation whose truly parental regard for her made her look upon him as another father who supplied the place of him she had lost  sir charles more charmed with her than ever was ready in his present flow of tender sentiments for her to offer her his hand with an unreservedness that would have satisfied all her delicate scruples but carried away by the force of habit an insurmountable aversion to marriage and the false but strongly impressed notion of refinements in an union of hearts where love was the only tie he could not resolve to give her a proof of his affection which in his opinion was the likeliest way to destroy all the ardor of it but careful not to alarm her and apprehending no great severity of morals from the gay interested mother he politely thanked her for the liberty she gave him to make his passion known to mrs darnley and to solicit her consent to his happiness  sophia observed with some concern that he affected to take no notice of mr herbert upon this occasion but she would not allow herself to dwell long upon a thought so capable of raising doubts injurious to his honor and satisfied with the frankness of his proceeding thus far she suffered no marks of discontent or apprehension to appear in her countenance and behavior  sir charles did not sail to make such a general declaration of his sentiments to mrs darnley as he thought sufficient to satisfy sophia without obliging himself to be more explicit and in the mean time having acquired a thorough knowledge of mrs darnleys character he sought to engage her in his interest by a boundless liberality and by gratifying all those passions which make corruption easy she loved dissipation and all the pleasures and amusements that inventive luxury had found out to vary the short scene of life were at her command she had a high taste for the pleasures of the table and therefore the most expensive wines and choicest delicacies that earth sea and air could afford were constantly supplied by him in the greatest profusion no day ever passed without her receiving some considerable present the value of which was inhanced by the delicacy with which it was made  the innocent sophia construed all this munificence into proofs of the sincerity of his affection for her for the young baronet whether awed by the dignity of her virtue or that he judged it necessary to secure the success of his designs mingled with the ardor of his professions a behavior so respectful and delicate as removed all her apprehensions and left her whole soul free to all the tender impressions a lively gratitude could make on it  mr herbert however easily penetrated into sir charless views he saw with pain the progress he made every day in the affection of sophia but by the speciousness of his conduct he had established himself so firmly in her good opinion that he judged any attempt to alarm her fears while there seemed so little foundation for them would miss its effect and not doubting but ere it was long her own observation would furnish her with some cause for apprehension he contented himself for the present with keeping a vigilant eye upon the conduct of sir charles and mrs darnley and with being ready to assist sophia in her perplexities whenever she had recourse to him  the change there was now in the situation of this amiable girl afforded him many opportunities of admiring the excellence of her character she who formerly used to be treated with neglect and even harshness by her mother was now distinguished with peculiar regard her opinion always submitted to with deference her inclinations consulted in all things and a studious endeavor to please her was to be seen in every word and action of mrs darnleys who affected to be as partially fond of her as she had once been of her sister  even the haughty insolent harriot keeping her rage and envy concealed in her own breast condescended to wear the appearance of kindness to her while she shared with her mother in all those gratifications which the lavish generosity of sir charles procured them and which sophia still continuing her usual simplicity of life could never be persuaded to partake of yet all this produced no alteration in sophia the same modesty and humility the same sweetness of temper and attention to oblige distinguished her now as in her days of oppression  mr herbert contemplated her with admiration and delight and often with astonishment reflected upon the infatuation of sir charles who could allow himself to be so far governed by fashionable prejudices and a libertine turn of mind as to balance one moment whether he should give himself a lawful claim to the affections of such a woman  affairs continued in this state during three months when the good old man who watched over his young favorite with all the pious solicitude of her guardian angel perceived that she was grown more melancholy and reserved than usual he often heard her sigh and fancied she had been weeping and her fine eyes would appear sometimes suffused with tears even when she endeavored to appear most cheerful  he imagined that she had something upon her mind which she wished to disclose to him her looks seemed to intimate as much and she frequently sought opportunities of being alone with him and engaged him to pass those evenings with her when her mother and sister were at any of the public entertainments yet all those times though her heart seemed laboring with some secret uneasiness which she would fain impart to him she had not resolution enough to enter into any explanation  mr herbert who could have wished she had been more communicative resolved at length to spare her any farther struggles with herself and one day when he was alone with her taking occasion to observe that she was not so cheerful as usual he asked her tenderly if any thing had happened to give her uneasiness speak freely my child said he to her and think you are speaking to a father  sophia made no other answer at first than by bursting into tears which seeming to relieve her a little she raised her head and looking upon the good man who beheld her with a fixed attention may i hope sir said she that you are still disposed to fulfill the kind promise you once made me  oh take me from hence pursued she relapsing into a new passion of tears place me in the situation to which my humble lot has called me save me from the weakness of my own heart  i now see plainly the delusion into which i have fallen but alas my mother does not see it  every thing here conspires against my peace  chap vii sophia takes a very extraordinary resolution mr herbert encourages her in it sophia as if afraid she had said too much stopped abruptly and fixing her eyes on the ground continued silent and lost in thought  mr herbert who had well considered the purport of her words passed over what he thought would give her too much pain to be explicit upon and answered in great concern then my fears are true sir charles is not disposed to act like a man of honor  a sudden blush glowed in the cheeks of sophia at the mention of sir charless name but it was not a blush of softness and confusion anger and disdain took the place of that sweet complacency which was the usual expression of her countenance and with a voice somewhat raised she replied eagerly  sir charles i believe has deceived me but him i can despise  yet do not imagine sir that he has dared to insult me by any unworthy proposals if he has any unjustifiable views upon me he has not had presumption enough to make me acquainted with them otherwise than by neglecting to convince me that they are honorable but he practices upon the easy credulity of my mother he lays snares for her gratitude by an interested generosity as i now too plainly perceive and he has the art to make her so much his friend that she will not listen to any thing i say which implies the least doubt of his honor  mr herbert sighed and cast down his eyes sophia continued in great emotion it is impossible for me sir to make you comprehend all the difficulties of my situation a man who takes every form to ensnare my affections but none to convince my judgment importunes me continually with declarations of tenderness and complaints of my coldness and indifference what can i do what ought i to answer to such discourse in this perplexity why will not my mother come to my assistance her years her authority as a parent give her a right to require such an explanation from sir charles as may free me from doubts which although reason suggests delicacy permits me not to make appear but such is my misfortune that i cannot persuade my mother there is the least foundation for my fears she is obstinate in her good opinion of sir charles and i am reduced to the sad necessity of either acting in open contradiction to her sentiments and commands or of continuing in a state of humiliating suspense to which my character must at last fall a sacrifice  that my dear child interrupted mr herbert is a point which ought to be considered i would not mention it to you first but since your own good sense has led the way to it i will frankly own that i am afraid innocent and good as you are the censures of the world will not spare you if you continue to receive sir charless visits doubtful as his intentions now appear to every one i know mrs darnley judges of the sincerity of his professions to you by the generosity he has shown in the presents he has heaped upon her  but my dear child that generosity was always suspected by me  i confess said sophia blushing i once thought favorably of him for the attention he showed to make my mothers life easy but if his liberality to her be indeed as you seem to think a snare what opinion ought i to form of his motives for a late offer he has made her and which at first dazzled me so noble and so disinterested did it appear  i know no offer but one interrupted mr herbert hastily which you ought even to have listened to  then the secret admonitions of my heart were right cried sophia with an accent that at once expressed exultation and grief  but what was this offer child said mr herbert i am impatient to know it  i will tell you the whole affair as it happened resumed sophia but you must not be surprised that my mother was pleased with sir charless offer he has been her benefactor and has a claim to her regard it would be strange if she had not a good opinion of him you know what that celebrated divine says whose writings you have made me acquainted with charity itself commands us where we know no ill to think well of all but friendship that goes always a pitch higher gives a man a peculiar right and claim to the good opinion of his friend my mother may be mistaken in the judgment she has formed of sir charles but it is her friendship for him a friendship founded upon gratitude for the good offices he has done her that has given rise to this mistake  sophia in her eagerness to justify her mother forgot that she had raised mr herberts curiosity and left it unsatisfied and the good old man charmed with the filial tenderness she showed upon this occasion listened to her with complacency though not with conviction at length she suddenly recollected herself and entered upon her story but a certain hesitation in her speech accompanied with a bashful air that made her withdraw her eyes from him to fix them upon the ground intimated plainly enough her own sentiments of the affair she was going to acquaint him with  you know sir said she sir charles has had a fit of illness lately which alarmed all his friends my mother was particularly attentive to him upon this occasion and i believe he was sensibly affected with her kind concern for him when he recovered he begged my mother my sister and myself would accompany him in a little excursion to hampstead to take the air we dined there and returning home early in the evening as we passed through brookstreet he ordered the coach to stop at the door of a very genteel house which appeared to be newly painted and fitted up sir charles desired us to go in with him and look at it and give him our opinion of the furniture nothing could be more elegant and genteel and we told him so at which he appeared extremely pleased for all had been done he said according to his directions  he came home with us and drank tea after which he had a private conversation with my mother which lasted about a quarter of an hour and when they returned to the room where they had left my sister and i sir charles appeared to me to have an unusual thoughtfulness in his countenance and my mother looked as if she had been weeping yet there was at the same time an expression of satisfaction in her face  he went away immediately when my mother eager to give vent to the emotions which filled her heart exclaimed oh sophia how much are you obliged to the generous affection of that man  you may imagine sir pursued sophia in a sweet confusion that i was greatly affected with these words i begged my mother to explain herself sir charles said she has made you a present of that house which we went to view this afternoon and here added she giving me a paper is a deed by which he has settled three hundred pounds a year upon you  i was silent so was my sister who looked at me as if impatient to know my thoughts of this extraordinary generosity my thoughts indeed were so perplexed my notions of this manner of acting so confused and uncertain that i knew not what to say my mother told us sir charles had declared to her that his late illness had given him occasion for many uneasy reflections upon my account that he shuddered with horror when he considered the unhappy state of my fortune and to what difficulties i should have been exposed if he had died and that for the satisfaction of his own mind he had made that settlement upon me that whatever happened i might be out of the reach of necessity  i am afraid sir pursued sophia with a little confusion in her countenance that you will condemn me when i tell you i was so struck at first with the seeming candor and tenderness of sir charless motives for this act of generosity that none but the most grateful sentiments rose in my mind  no my dear replied mr herbert i do not condemn you this snare was artfully laid but when was it that your heart or rather your reason gave you those secret admonitions you spoke of  immediately said sophia a moments reflection upon the conduct of sir charles served to show me that some latent design lay concealed under this specious offer but i am obliged to my sister for giving me a more distinct notion of it than my own confused ideas could furnish me with  then you desired to know her opinion said mr herbert  certainly resumed sophia this conversation passed in her presence and as my elder sister she had a right to be consulted  pray what did she say asked mr herbert impatiently  you know sir said sophia with a gentle smile my sister takes every opportunity to rally me about my pretensions to wit she told me it was great condescension in me who thought myself wiser than all the world besides to ask her advice upon this occasion and that she would not expose herself to my contempt by declaring her opinion any farther than that she supposed sir charles did not consider this as a marriagesettlement  these last words pursued sophia whose face was now covered with a deeper blush let in so much light upon my mind that i was ashamed and angry with myself for having doubted a moment of sir charless insincerity i thanked my sister and told her she should see that i would profit by the hint she had given me  i wish interrupted mr herbert that she may profit as much by you but people of good understanding learn more from the ignorant than the ignorant do from them because the wise avoid the follies of fools but fools will not follow the example of the wise but what did mrs darnley say to this  i never saw her so angry with my sister before replied sophia she said several severe things to her which made her leave the room in great emotion and when we were alone i endeavored to convince my mother that it was not fit i should make myself a dependant upon sir charles by accepting such considerable presents she was however of a different opinion because sir charless behavior had been always respectful in the highest degree to me and because the manner in which he made this offer left no room to suspect that he had any other design in it but to secure a provision for me in case any thing should happen to him  your mother imposes upon herself replied mr herbert but i hope my dear child you think more justly  you may judge of my sentiments sir answered sophia by the resolution i have taken i wished to consult you but as i had no opportunity for it i satisfied myself with doing what i thought you would approve my mother pressed by my arguments told me in a peevish way that i might act as i thought proper upon which i retired and satisfied with this permission i enclosed the settlement in a cover directed to sir charles i had just sealed it and was going to send it away when my mother came into my room i perceived she was desirous to renew the conversation about sir charles but i carefully avoided it for fear she should retract the permission she had given me to act as i pleased upon this occasion my reserve piqued her so much that she forbore to enter upon the subject again but as i had no opportunity of sending any letter that night without her knowledge i was obliged to go to bed much richer than i desired to be and the next morning when we were at breakfast a letter was brought me from sir charles dated four oclock in which he informed me that he was just setting out in a postchaise for bath his uncle who lies there at the point of death has it seems earnestly desired to see him and the messenger told him he had not a minute to lose  i am sorry interrupted mr herbert that he did not get your letter before he went  sophia then taking it out of her pocket gave it to him and begged he would contrive some way to have it safely delivered to sir charles and now added she my heart is easy on that side and i have nothing to do but to arm myself with fortitude to bear the tender reproaches of a mother whose anxiety for my interest makes her see this affair in a very different light from that in which you and i behold it  mr herbert put the letter carefully into his pocketbook and promised her it should be conveyed to sir charles then taking her hand which he pressed affectionately you have another sacrifice yet to make my dear good child said he and i hope it will not cost you much to make it you must resolve to see sir charles no more it is not fit you should receive his visits since you suspect his designs are not honorable and you have but too much cause for suspicion it is not enough to be virtuous we must appear so likewise we owe the world a good example the world which oftener rewards the appearances of merit than merit itself it will be impossible for you to avoid seeing sir charles sometimes if you continue with your mother you have no authority to forbid his visits here and whether you share them or not they will be all placed to your account are you willing miss sophia to go into the country and i will board you in the family of a worthy clergyman who is my friend his wife and daughters will be agreeable companions for you you will find books enough in his study to employ those hours which you devote to reading and his conversation will be always a source of instruction and delight  sophia with tears in her eyes and a look so expressive that it conveyed a stronger idea of the grateful sentiments which filled her heart than any words could do thanked the good old man for his generous offer and told him she was ready to leave london whenever he pleased but unwilling to be an encumbrance upon his little fortune she entreated him to be diligent in his enquiries for a place for her that she might early inure herself to the humble condition which providence thought fit to allot for her  mr herbert entering into her delicate scruples promised to procure her a proper establishment and it was agreed between them that he should acquaint her mother the next day with the resolution the had taken and endeavor to procure her consent to it  chap viii mr herbert and sophia carry their point with great difficulty mr herbert well knew all the difficulties of this task and prepared himself to sustain the storm which he expected would fall upon him he visited mrs darnley in the morning and finding her alone entered at once into the affair by telling her that he had performed the commission miss sophia had given him that a friend of his who was going to bath would take care to deliver her letter to her unworthy lover who added he will be convinced by her returning his settlement that she has a just notion of his base designs and despises him as well for his falsehood and presumption as for the mean opinion he has entertained of her  the old gentleman who was perfectly well acquainted with mrs darnleys character and had studied his part would not give her time to recover from the astonishment his first words had thrown her into which was strongly impressed upon her countenance and which seemed to deprive her of the power of speech but added with an air natural enough your conduct mrs darnley deserves the highest praises indeed i know not which to admire most your disinterestedness prudence and judgment or miss sophias ready obedience and the noble sacrifice she makes to her honor and reputation you knew her virtue might be securely depended upon and you permitted her to act as she thought proper with regard to the insidious offer sir charles made her thus by transferring all the merit of a refusal to her you reflect a double luster upon your own and she has fully answered your intentions by rejecting that offer with the contempt it deserved  while mr herbert went on in this strain mrs darnley insensibly forgot her resentment her features assumed all that complacency which gratified vanity and selfapplause could impress upon them and although she was conscious her sentiments were very different from those which mr herbert attributed to her yet as she had really spoke those words to sophia which had given her a pretense to act as she had done she concluded his praises were sincere and enjoyed them as much as if she had deserved them  it was her business now however vexed at her daughters folly as she conceived it to seem highly satisfied with her conduct since what she had done could not be recalled yet inwardly fretting at the loss of so noble a present all her dissimulation could not hinder her from saying that although she approved of sophias refusal yet she could not help thinking she had been very precipitate and that she ought to have waited till sir charles returned and not have sent but have given him back his settlement  mr herbert without answering to that point told her that what now remained for her prudence to do was to take away all foundation for slander by peremptorily forbidding sir charless future visits here mrs darnley began to frown for since it is plain to us all madam pursued he without seeming to perceive her emotion that marriage is not his intention by being allowed to continue his addresses miss sophias character will suffer greatly in the opinion of the world and the wisdom and discretion by which you have hitherto been governed in this affair will not secure you from very unfavourable censures to show therefore how much you are in earnest to prevent them i think it is absolutely necessary that you should send your daughter out of this mans way  mrs darnley who thought she had an unanswerable objection to make to this scheme interrupted him eagerly you know my circumstances mr herbert you know i cannot afford to send my daughter from me how am i to dispose of her pray  let not that care trouble you madam replied mr herbert i will take all this expense upon myself i love miss sophia as well as if she was my own child and slender as my income is i will be at the charge of her maintenance till fortune and her own merit place her in a better situation  mr herbert then acquainted her with the name and character of the clergyman in whose family he intended to place sophia he added that the village to which she was going being at no great distance she might hear from her frequently and sometimes visit her without much expense or inconvenience  mrs darnley having nothing that was reasonable to oppose to these kind and generous offers had recourse to rage and exclamation she told mr herbert that he had no right to interpose in the affairs of her family that he should not dispose of her daughter as he pleased that she would exert the authority of a parent and no officious meddler should rob her of her child  mr herbert now found it necessary to change his method with this interested mother take care madam said he with a severe look how far you carry your opposition in this case the world has its eyes upon your conduct do not give it reason to say that your daughter is more prudent and cautious than you are nor force her to do that without your consent which you ought to be the first to advise her to  without my consent replied mrs darnley almost breathless with rage will she go without my consent say you have you alienated her affections from me so far i will soon know that  then rising with a furious air she called sophia who came into the room trembling and in the utmost agitation the melancholy that appeared in her countenance the paleness and disorder the consequences of a sleepless night which she had passed in various and afflicting thoughts made mr herbert apprehensive that her mothers obstinacy would prove too hard for her gentle disposition and that her heart thus assaulted with the most powerful of all passions love and filial tenderness would insensibly betray her into a consent to stay  mrs darnley giving her a look of indignation exclaimed with the sarcastic severity with which she used formerly to treat her so my wise my dutiful daughter you cannot bear it seems to live with your mother you are resolved to run away from me are you  madam replied sophia with a firmness that disconcerted mrs darnley as much as it pleasingly surprised mr herbert it is not you i am running away from as you unkindly say i am going into the country to free myself from the pursuits of a man who has imposed upon your goodness and my credulity one who i am convinced seeks my dishonor and whose ensnaring addresses have already i am afraid given a wound to my reputation which nothing but the resolution i have taken to avoid him can heal  poor sophia who had with difficulty prevailed over her own softness to speak in this determined manner could not bear to see the confusion into which her answer had thrown her mother but sighing deeply she retired toward the window and wiped away the tears that fell from her charming eyes  mrs darnley who observed her emotion and well knew how to take advantage of that amiable weakness in her temper which made any opposition however just and necessary painful to her desired mr herbert to leave her alone with her daughter adding that his presence was a constraint upon them both  sophia hearing this and dreading lest he should leave her to sustain the storm alone went toward her mother and with the most persuasive look and accent begged her not to part in anger from mr herbert  i cannot forgive mr herbert said mrs darnley for supposing i am less concerned for your honor than he is i see no necessity for your going into the country your reputation is safe while you are under my care it is time enough to send you out of sir charless way when we are convinced his designs are not honorable mr herbert by filling your head with groundless apprehensions will be the ruin of your fortune  sir charless dissembled affection for me interrupted sophia will be the ruin of my character there is no way to convince the world that i am not the willing dupe of his artifices but by flying from him as far as i can do not my dear mamma pursued she bursting into tears oppose my going my peace of mind my reputation depend upon it  you shall go when i think proper replied mrs darnley and as for you sir turning to mr herbert i desire you will not interpose any farther in this matter  indeed i must madam said the good old man encouraged by a look sophia gave him i consider myself as guardian to your daughter and in that quality i pretend to some right to regulate her conduct on an occasion which requires a guardians care and authority  ridiculous exclaimed mrs darnley with a malignant sneer what a jest to call yourself guardian to a girl who has not a shilling to depend upon  i am the guardian of her honor and reputation said mr herbert these make up her fortune and with these she is richer than if she possessed thousands without them  and do you miss said mrs darnley to her daughter with a scornful air do you allow this foolish claim are you this gentlemans ward pray  come madam said mr herbert willing to spare sophia the pain of answering her question be persuaded that i have the tenderness of a parent as well as guardian for your daughter it is absolutely necessary she should see sir charles no more and the most effectual method she can take to shun him and to preserve her character is to leave a place where she will be continually exposed to his importunity i hope she will be able to procure your consent to her going tomorrow i shall be here in the morning with a postchaise and will conduct her myself to the house of my friend whom i have already prepared by a letter to receive her  mr herbert without waiting for any answer bowed and left the room sophia followed him to the door and by a speaking glance assured him he might depend upon her perseverance  chap ix in which sophia shows less of the heroine than the woman as soon as mr herbert went away harriot who had been listening and had heard all that past entered the room the virtue and strength of mind her sister showed in the design she had formed of flying from sir charles stanley excited her envy and she would have joined with her mother in endeavoring to prevail upon her to stay to prevent the superiority such a conduct gave her had not that envy found a more sensible gratification in the thought that sophia would no longer receive the adorations of the young baronet and that all her towering hopes would be changed to disappointment and grief  the discontinuance of those presents which sir charles so liberally bestowed on them evidently on sophias account and which had hitherto enabled them to live in affluence affected her but little for vanity is a more powerful passion than interest in the heart of a coquet and the pleasure of seeing her sister mortified and deserted by her lover outweighed all other considerations besides she was not without hopes that when sophia was out of the way her own charms would regain all their former influence over the heart of sir charles  she came prepared therefore to support her in her resolution of going into the country but mrs darnley who did not enter into her views and who had no other attention but to secure to herself that ease and affluence she at present enjoyed expected harriot would use her utmost efforts to prevent her sister from disobliging a man whose liberality was the source of their happiness  she complained to her in a tender manner of sophias unkindness she exaggerated the ill consequences that might be apprehended from the affront she put on sir charles by thus avowing the most injurious suspicions of him and declared she expected nothing less than to be reduced by the loss of her pension to that state of misery from which he had formerly relieved her  sophia melted into tears at these words but a moments reflection convinced her that her mothers apprehensions were altogether groundless sir charles was not capable of so mean a revenge and sophia on this occasion defended him with so much ardor that miss darnley could not help indulging her malice by throwing out some severe sarcasms upon the violence of her affection for a man whom she affected to despise  sophia blushed but answered calmly well sister if i love sir charles stanley i have the more merit in leaving him  oh not a bit the more for that replied harriot for as i read in one of your books just now virtue would not go so far if pride did not bear her company  you might also have read sister said sophia that no woman is envious of anothers virtue who is conscious of her own  this retort threw harriot into so violent a rage that sophia who knew what excesses she was capable of left the room and retired to pack up her clothes that she might be ready when mr herbert called for her  in this employment mrs darnley gave her no interruption for harriot having quitted her mother in a huff because she did not join with her against sophia she was left at liberty to pursue her own reflections after long doubt and perplexity in what manner to act she resolved to consent that sophia should depart for she saw plainly that it would not be in her power to prevent it and she was willing to derive some merit from the necessity she was under of complying she considered that if sir charles really loved her daughter her flight on such motives would rather increase than lessen his passion and that all his resentment for being deprived of her sight would fall upon mr herbert who alone was in fault  mrs darnley as has been before observed was not of a temper to anticipate misfortunes or to give herself much uneasiness about evils in futurity she always hoped the best not because she had any wellgrounded reasons for it but because it was much more pleasing to hope than to fear  sophia when she saw her next found her surprisingly altered she not only no longer opposed her departure but even seemed desirous of it and this she thought a masterpiece of cunning which could not fail of gaining mr herberts good opinion never once reflecting that her former opposition deprived her of all the merit of a voluntary compliance  this change in mrs darnley left sophia no more difficulties to encounter but what she found in her own heart industrious to deceive herself she had imputed all the uneasy emotions there to the grief of leaving her mother contrary to her inclination she had now her free consent to go yet still those perturbations remained she thanked her mother for her indulgence she took her hand and tenderly pressed it to her lips tears at the same time flowing fast from her eyes  mrs darnley was cruel enough to show that she understood the cause of this sudden passion what said she to the poor blushing sophia after all the clutter you have made about leaving sir charles does your heart fail you now you come to the trial  sophia abashed and silent hid her glowing face with her handkerchief and having with some difficulty represt another gush of tears assumed composure enough to tell her mother that she hoped she should never want fortitude to do her duty  to be sure replied mrs darnley with asneer one so wise as you can never mistake your duty  sophia however understood hers so well that she did not offer to recriminate upon this occasion for mrs darnley was but a shallow politician and was thrown so much off her guard by the vexation she felt that an affair on which she built such great hopes had taken so different a turn that she gave plain indications of her displeasure and that her consent to her daughters going was indeed extorted from her  sophia had many of these assaults to sustain as well from harriot as mrs darnley during the remainder of that day but they were of use to her her pride was concerned to prevent giving a real cause for such sarcasms as her sister in particular threw out opposition kept up her spirits and preserved her mind from yielding to that tender grief which the idea of parting for ever from sir charles excited  chap x the description of two rural beauties when mr herbert came the next morning mrs darnley who had no better part to play had recourse again to dissimulation and expressed great willingness to send her daughter away but the good man who saw the feint in her overacted satisfaction suffered her to imagine that she had effectually imposed upon him  sophia wept when she took leave of her mother and returned the cold salute her sister gave her with an affectionate embrace she sighed deeply as mr herbert helped her into the postchaise and continued pensive and silent for several minutes not daring to raise her eyes up to her kind conductor lest he should read in them what passed in her heart  mr herbert who guessed what she felt on this occasion was sensibly affected with that soft melancholy so easy to be discovered in her countenance notwithstanding all her endeavors to conceal it he wished to comfort her but the subject was too delicate to be mentioned kind and indulgent as he was he began to think his admired sophia carried her concern on this occasion too far so true that observations is that the case of tried virtue is harder than that of untried we require from it as debts continual exertions of its power and if we are at any time disappointed in our expectations we blame with resentment as if we had been deceived  sophias sensibility however was very excusable in flying from sir charles she had done all that the most rigid virtue could demand for as yet she had only suspicions against him and this man whose generous gift she had returned with silent scorn whom she had avoided as an enemy had hitherto behaved to her with all the tenderness of a lover and all the benevolence of a friend it was under that amiable idea that he now presented himself to her imagination her pride and her resentment were appeased by the sacrifice she had made in her abrupt departure and every unkind thought of him was changed to tender regret for his loss  mr herbert by not attempting to divert the course of her reflections soon drew her out of her revery his silence and reserve first intimated to her the impropriety of her behavior she immediately assumed her usual composure and during the remainder of their little journey she appeared as cheerful and serene as if nothing extraordinary had happened  the good curate with whom she was to lodge having rode out to meet his friend and his fair guest joined them when they had come within three miles of his house mr herbert who had descried him at a little distance showed him to sophia there my dear said he is a man who with more piety and learning than would serve to make ten bishops is obliged to hire himself out at the rate of sixty pounds a year to do the duty of the parish church the rector of which enjoys three lucrative benefices without praying or preaching above five times in a twelvemonth  mr lawson for that was the curates name had now galloped up to the chaise which mr herbert had ordered the postboy to stop and many kind salutations passed between the two friends  sophia was particularly pleased with the candor and benevolonce which appeared in the looks and behavior of the good clergyman who gazed on her attentively and found the good opinion he had entertained of her from mr herberts representations fully confirmed the bewitching sweetness in her voice and eyes the spirit that animated her looks and the peculiar elegance of her person and address produced their usual effects and filled mr lawsons heart with sentiments of tenderness esteem and respect for her  mrs lawson and her two daughters received her with that true politeness which is founded on good sense and good nature both the young women were extremely agreeable in their persons and sophia contemplated with admiration the neat simplicity of their dress their artless beauty and native sweetness of manners health dyed their cheeks with blushes more beautiful than those the fine lady borrows from paint innocence and cheerfulness lighted up smiles in their faces as powerful as those of the most finished coquet and good humor and a sincere desire of obliging gave graces to their behavior which ceremony but poorly imitates  these were sophias observations to mr herbert who seized the first opportunity of speaking to her apart to ask her opinion of her new companions he was rejoiced to hear her express great satisfaction in her new situation and not doubting but time and absence assisted by her own good sense and virtue would banish sir charles stanley entirely from her remembrance he scrupled not to leave her at the end of three days after having tenderly recommended her to the care of this little worthy family every individual of which already loved her with extreme affection  sophia was indeed so much delighted with the new scene of life she had entered upon and her fancy was at first so struck with the novelty of all the objects she beheld that the continual dissipation of her thoughts left no room for the idea of the baronet but this deceitful calm lasted not long she soon found by experience that the silence and solitude of the country were more proper to nourish love than to destroy it and that groves and meads the nightingales song and the rivulets murmur were food for tender melancholy and the soft reveries of imagination  mr lawsons house was most romanticly situated on the borders of a spacious park from whose opulent owner he rented a small farm which supplied his family with almost all the necessaries of life mrs lawson his wife brought him a very small fortune but a great stock of virtue good sense and prudence she had seen enough of the world to polish her manners without corrupting her heart and having lived most part of her time in the country she understood rural affairs perfectly well and superintended all the business of their little farm their two daughters were at once the best housewifes and the most accomplished young women in that part of the country mr lawson took upon himself the delightful task of improving their minds and giving them a taste for useful knowledge and their mother besides instructing them in all the economical duties suitable to their humble fortunes formed them to those decencies of manners and propriety of behavior which she had acquired by a genteel education and the conversation of persons of rank in the affairs of the family each of the young women had their particular province assigned them dolly the eldest presided in the dairy and fanny so was the youngest called assisted in the management of the house sophia soon entertained a friendship for them both but a powerful inclination attached her particularly to dolly there was in the countenance of this young woman a certain sweetness and sensibility that pleased sophia extremely and though she had all that cheerfulness which youth health and innocence inspire yet the pensiveness that would sometimes steal over her sweet features the gentle sighs that would now and then escape her excited a partial tenderness for her in the heart of sophia  she took pleasure in assisting her in her little employments dolly insensibly lost that awe which the presence of the fair londoner first inspired and repaid her tenderness with that warmth of affection which only young and innocent minds are capable of feeling  chap xi sophia makes an interesting discovery sophia instructed by her own experience soon discovered that her young friend was in love but neither of them disclosed the secret of their hearts to each other dolly was withheld by bashful timidity sophia by delicate reserve fond as they were of each others company yet the want of this mutual confidence made them sometime choose to be alone sophia having one evening strayed in the wood wholly absorbed in melancholy thoughts lost her way and was in some perplexity how to recover the path that led to mr lawsons house when looking anxiously around her she saw dolly at a distance sitting under a tree overjoyed to meet her so luckily she was running up to her but stopped upon the appearance of a young man who seeing dolly flew toward her with the utmost eagerness and with such an expression of joyful surprise in his countenance as persuaded her this meeting was accidental  sophia not willing to interrupt their conversation passed on softly behind the trees unobserved by dolly who continued in the same pensive attitude but being now nearer to her she perceived she was weeping excessively  sophia who was greatly affected at this fight could not help accompanying her tears with some of her own and not daring to stir a step farther for fear of being seen by the youth she resolved to take advantage of her situation to know the occasion of dollys extraordinary affliction  the poor girl was so wrapped in thought that she neither saw nor heard the approach of her lover who called to her in the tenderest accent imaginable my dear dolly is it you will not you look at me will not you speak to me what have i done to make you angry my love dont go for upon hearing his voice she started from her seat and seemed desirous to avoid him dont go my dear dolly said he following her and she went slowly enough dont drive me to despair  what would you have me do mr william said she stopping and turning gently toward him you know my father has forbid me to speak to you and i would die rather than disoblige him you may thank your proud rich aunt for all this pray let me go pursued she making some faint efforts to withdraw her hand which he had seized and held fast in his you must forget me william as i have resolved to forget you added she sighing and turning away her head lest he should see the tears that fell from her eyes  cruel as these words sounded in the ears of the passionate william yet he found something in her voice and actions that comforted him no my dear dolly said he endeavoring to look in her averted face i will not believe that you have resolved to forget me you can no more forget me than i can you and i shall love you as long as i live  i know you say this only to grieve me you do not mean it  yes i do mean it replied dolly in a peevish accent vexed that he had seen her tears i know my duty and you shall find that i can obey my father while she spoke this she struggled so much in earnest to free her hand from his that fearing to offend her he dropped it with a submissive air  dolly having now no pretense for staying any longer bid him farewell in a faltering voice and went on though with a slow pace toward her fathers house the youth continued for a moment motionless as a statue with a countenance pale as death and his eyes which were suffused with tears fixed on the parting virgin  what cried he at last in the most plaintive tone imaginable can you really leave me thus go then my dear unkind dolly i will trouble you no more with my hateful presence i wish you happy but if you hear that any strange mischief has befallen me be assured you are the cause of it  he followed her as he spoke and dolly no longer able to continue her assumed rigor stopped when he approached her and burst into tears the lover felt all his hopes revive at this sight and taking her hand which he kissed a thousand times he uttered the tenderest vows of love and constancy to which she listened in silence only now and then softly sighing at length she disengaged her hand and gently begged him to leave her lest he should be seen by any of the family the happy youth once more convinced of her affection for him obeyed without a murmur  dolly as soon as he had quitted her ran hastily toward home but he as if every step was leading him to his grave moved slowly on often looking back and often stopping so that sophia who was afraid she would not be able to overtake her friend was obliged to hazard being seen by him and followed dolly with all the speed she could as soon as she was near enough to be heard she called out to her to stay dolly stopped but was in so much confusion at the thought of having been seen by miss darnley with her lover that she had not courage to go and meet her ah miss dolly said sophia smiling i have made a discovery but i do assure you it was as accidental as your meeting with that handsome youth who i find is your lover  yes indeed replied dolly whose face was covered with blushes my meeting with that young man was not designed at least on my part but surely you jest miss darnley when you call him handsome do you really think him handsome  upon my word i do said sophia he is one of the prettiest youths i ever saw and if the professions of men may be relied on added she with a sigh he certainly loves you but my dear dolly by what i could learn from your conversation he has not your fathers consent to make his addresses to you i was sorry to hear that dolly because i perceive my dear that you like him  dolly now held down her head and blushed more than before but continued silent perhaps you will think me impertinent resumed sophia for speaking so freely about your affairs but i love you dearly miss dolly  and i interrupted dolly throwing one of her arms about sophias neck and kissing her cheek love you miss darnley better a thousand times than ever i loved any body except my father and mother and my sister  well well said sophia i will not dispute that point with you now but if you love me so much as you say my dear dolly why have you made a secret of this affair friends do not use to be so reserved with each other  perhaps said dolly smiling a little archly you have taught me to be reserved by your example but indeed added she with a graver look and accent i am not worthy to be your confidant you are my superior in every thing it would be presumption in me to desire to know your secrets  you shall know every thing that concerns me interrupted sophia which can be of use to you and add weight to that advice i shall take the liberty to give you upon this occasion i am far from being happy my dear dolly and i blush to say it it has been in the power of a deceitful man greatly to disturb my peace  sophia here wiped her charming eyes and dolly who wept sympathetically for her and for herself exclaimed is there a man in the world who could be false to you alas what have i to expect  come my dear said sophia leading her to the root of a large tree let us sit down here we shall not be called to supper yet you have time enough to give me some account of this young man whom i should be glad to find worthy of you tell me how your acquaintance began and what are your fathers reasons for forbidding your correspondence  chap xii the beginning of a very simple story dolly though encouraged by the sweet condescension of sophia who to inspire her with confidence freely acknowledged the situation of her own heart blushed so much and was in such apparent confusion that sophia was concerned at having made her a request which gave her so much pain to comply with  at length the innocent girl looking up to her with a bashful air said i should be ashamed dear miss to own my weakness to you if i did not know that you are too generous to think the worse of me for it to be sure i have a great value for mr william but i was not so foolish as to be taken with his handsomeness only though indeed he is very handsome and i am delighted to find that you think him so but mr william as my father can tell you madam is a very fine scholar he was educated in a great school at london and there is not a young squire in all this country who has half his learning or knows how to behave himself so genteely as he does though his father is but a farmer however he is rich and he has but one child besides mr william and that is a sickly boy and not likely to live so that mr william it is thought will have all  i should imagine then said sophia that this young man would not be a bad match for you  a bad match replied dolly sighing no certainly but his aunt looks higher for him yet there was a time when she was well enough pleased with his liking me  what is his aunt said sophia and how does it happen that she has any authority over him  why you must know madam answered dolly that his aunt is very rich when she was a young woman a great lady took a fancy to her and kept her as her companion a great many years and when she died she left her all her clothes and jewels and a prodigious deal of money she never would marry for she was crossed in love they say in her youth and that makes her so illnatured and spiteful i believe to young people but notwithstanding that i cannot help loving her because she was always so fond of mr william she is his godmother and when he was about ten years old she sent for him to london and declared she would provide for him as her own and indeed she acted like a mother toward him she put him to school and maintained him like a gentleman and when he grew up she would have made a gentleman of him for she had a great desire that he should be an officer  mr william at that time was very fond of being an officer too but as he was very dutiful and obedient to his father indeed miss sophia he is one of the best young men in the world he desired leave to consult him first so about a year ago he came to visit his father and has never been at london since and he had not been long in the country before he changed his mind as to being an officer and declared he would be a farmer like his father and live a country life  ah dolly said sophia smiling i suspect you were the cause of this change my friend  why indeed replied dolly he has since told me so but perhaps he flattered me when he said it for ah my dear miss i remember what you said just now about the deceitfulness of men and i tremble lest mr william should be like the rest  well my dear interrupted sophia go on with your story i am impatient to know when you saw each other first and how your acquaintance began  you know madam said dolly my father keeps us very retired i had no opportunity of seeing mr william but at church we had heard that farmer gibbons had a fine son come from london and the sunday afterward when we were at church my sister who is a giddy wild girl as you know kept staring about in hopes of seeing him at last she pulled me hastily and whispered look look dolly there is farmer gibbons just come in and i am sure he has got his london son with him see what a handsome young man he is and how genteely he is dressed  well madam i looked up and to be sure i met mr williams eyes full upon me i felt my face glow like fire for as soon as i looked upon him he made me a low bow my sister courtefied but for my part i dont know whether i courtesied or not i was never so confused in my life and during the whole time we were at church i scarce ever durst raise my eyes for i was sure to find mr william looking into our pew  i suppose you was not displeased with him said sophia for taking so much notice of you  i do not know whether i was or not replied dolly but i know that i was in a strange confusion during all churchtime yet i observed that mr william did not go out when the rest of the congregation did but staid behind which made my sister laugh for he looked foolish enough standing alone but he staid to have an opportunity of making us another bow for it is my fathers custom as soon as he has dismissed the people to come into our pew and take us home with him i never shall forget how respectfully mr william saluted my father as he passed him i now made amends for my former neglect of him and returned the bow he made me with a very low courtesy  fanny and i talked of him all the way home i took delight in hearing her praise him and although i was never used to disguise my thoughts before yet i knew not how it was but i was ashamed to speak so freely of him as she did and yet i am sure i thought as well of him  i dare say you did said sophia smiling but my dear pursued she in a graver accent this was a very sudden impression suppose this young man whose person captivated you so much had been wild and dissolute as many young men are how would you have excused yourself for that early prejudice in his favor which you took in so readily at your eyes without consulting your judgment in the least  chap xiii dolly continues her story dolly fixing her bashful looks on the ground remained silent for a moment then sighing answered i am sure if i had not believed mr william good and virtuous i should never have liked him though he had been a hundred times handsomer than he is but it was impossible to look on him and think him otherwise and if you had observed him well miss darnley his countenance has so much sweetness and candor in it as my father once said that you could not have thought ill of him  it is not always safe said sophia sighing likewise to trust to appearances mens actions as well as their looks often deceive us and you must allow my dear dolly that there is danger in these sudden attachments but when did you see this pretty youth again  not till the next sunday replied dolly and though you should chide me never so much yet i must tell you that this seemed the longest week i ever knew in my life i did not doubt but he would be at church again and i longed impatiently for sunday at last sunday came we went with my father as usual to church and would you believe it miss darnley though i wished so much to see mr william yet now i dreaded meeting him and trembled so when i came into church that i was obliged to take hold of fanny to keep me from falling she soon discovered him and pulled me in order to make me look up he had placed himself in our way so that we passed close by him he made us a very low bow and my mother who had not seen him before smiled and looked extremely pleased with him for to be sure madam she could not help admiring him  well i was very uneasy all the time we were in church for fanny whispered me that my sweetheart for so she called mr william minded nothing but me this made me blush excessively and i was afraid my mother would take notice of his staring and my confusion so that heaven forgive me i was glad when the sermon was ended he made us his usual compliment at our going out but i did not look up however i was impatient to be alone with fanny that i might talk of him and in the evening we walked toward the park just as we had placed ourselves under a tree we saw a fine dressed gentleman a visiter of the squires as we supposed coming up to us upon which we rose and walked homewards but the gentleman followed us and coming close to me stared impudently under my hat and swearing a great oath said i was a pretty girl and he would have a kiss fanny seeing him take me by the arm screamed aloud but i pretending not to be frightened though i trembled sadly civilly begged him to let me go he did not regard what i said but was extremely rude so that i now began to scream as loud as fanny struggling all the time to get from him but in vain and now who should come to my assistance but mr william i saw him flying across a field and my heart told me it was he before he came near enough for me to know him  as soon as fanny perceived him she ran to him and begged him to help me but he did not need entreaty he flew like a bird to the place where i was and left fanny far behind the rude gentleman bad him be gone and threatened him severely for he had taken the hand i had at liberty which i gladly gave him and insisted upon his letting me go and now my dear miss darnley all my fears were for him for the gentleman declared that if he did not go about his business he would run him through the body and actually drew his sword i thought i should have died at that terrible sight my sister run toward home crying like one distracted and as for me though the man had let go my hand and i might have run away yet i could not bear to leave mr william to the mercy of that cruel wretch and i did what at another time i should have blushed to have done i took his hand and pulled him with all my force away but he enraged at being called puppy by the gentleman who continued swearing that he would do him a mischief if he did not leave the place begged me to make the best of my way home and turning furiously to him who was brandishing his sword about he knocked him down with one stroke of a cudgel which he fortunately had in his hand and snatching his sword from him he threw it among the bushes  upon my word said sophia your williams character rises upon me every moment this was a very gallant action and i do not wonder at your liking him now  ah miss cried dolly if you had seen how he looked when he came back to me if you had heard the fine things he said  well you may imagine i thanked him for the kindness he had done me and he protested he would with pleasure lose his life for my sake i think i could have listened to him for ever but now my father appeared in sight my sister had alarmed him greatly with her account of what had happened and he was coming hastily to my assistance followed by my mother and all the family as soon as we perceived them coming we mended our pace for we had walked very slowly hitherto then it was that mr william who had not spoke so plainly before told me how much he loved me and begged i would give him leave to see me sometimes i replied that depended upon my father and this was prudent was it not my dear miss darnley  indeed it was answered sophia but what said your lover  he sighed madam resumed dolly and said he was afraid my father would not think him worthy of me he owned he was no otherwise worthy of me than from the great affection he bore me and then  but here i fear you will think him too bold and perhaps blame me  i hope not said sophia  why madam continued dolly he took my hand and kissed it a thousand times and though i did all i could to be sure to pull it away yet he would not part with it till my father was so near that he was afraid he would observe him and then he let it go and begged me in a whisper not to hate him bless me what a strange request that was miss darnley how could i hate one to whom i had been so greatly obliged i was ready to burst into tears at the very thought and told him i was so far from hating him that   pray go on my dear said sophia observing she hesitated and was silent  i told him madam resumed she that i would always regard him as long as i lived  i did not say too much did i  i suppose said sophia you gave him to understand that it was in gratitude for the service he had done you  to be sure said dolly i put it in that light well i am glad you approve of my behavior miss darnley so as i was telling you my father came up to us and thanked mr william for having rescued his daughter he then asked him what he had done with the rude fellow mr william told him he had given him a lucky stroke with his cudgel which made him measure his length on the ground but said he and sure that showed excessive good nature i hope i have not hurt him much  my father said he would go and see and then shaking mr william kindly by the hand he called him a brave youth and said he hoped they should be better acquainted  oh how glad was i to hear him say so my mother too was vastly civil to him and as for fanny i thought she would have hugged him she was so pleased with him for his kindness to me my mother insisted upon his staying to drink tea with us and as soon as my father came back we all went in together  pray what became of the poor vanquished knight said sophia smiling  oh i forgot to tell you resumed dolly that my father said he saw him creeping along as if he was sorely bruised with his fall supporting himself with his sword which it seems he had found we were all glad it was no worse and mr william having accepted my mothers invitation he staid with us till the evening was pretty far advanced and then my father accompanied him part of his way home and at parting as he told us desired to see him often  he was not backward you may be sure in complying with his request he came so often that my father was surprised and besides my sister and i scarce ever went out to walk but we met him so that one would have imagined he lived in the fields about our house my mother at last suspected the truth and questioned me about him and i told her all that he had ever said to me and not long afterward he took an opportunity to open his heart to my father and asked his permission to make his addresses to me with such modesty and good sense he spoke that my father was extremely pleased with him but told him that he must consult his friends and know whether they approved of it and then he would consider of his proposal mr william as he afterward told me wrote to his aunt first for he was well assured that his father would agree to any thing which she thought for his advantage  he had a very favorable answer from mrs gibbons for she had changed her mind also with regard to his being an officer as war was then talked of and she was afraid of his being sent abroad he showed me her letter and she told him in it that since he was resolved to settle in the country she approved of his marrying and was glad he had not fixed his affections upon some homespun farmers daughter but had chosen a gentlewoman and one who was well brought up she added that she intended to come into the country in a few weeks and if she found the young lady so she called me answered his description she would hasten the marriage and settle us handsomely  oh how pleased was i with this letter and how did it rejoice mr william  i should never have done were i to tell you all the tender things he said to me mr gibbons at his sons desire came to my father and begged him to give his consent which he obtained for my father had well considered the affair before and nothing was wanting but mrs gibbons arrival to make us all happy mr william thought every hour an age till she came and pressed her continually in his letters to hasten her journey  alas if he had known what was to happen he would not have been so impatient for soon after she came all our fine hopes were blasted and i have now nothing to expect but misery  chap xiv sir charles makes his appearance again poor dolly was so oppressed with grief when she came to this part of her story that she was unable to proceed and burst into tears the tender sophia who was greatly affected with the anguish she saw her in employed every soothing art to comfort her and dolly being a little composed was going to continue her story when she saw her sister looking about for them sophia and she immediately rose up and joined fanny who rallied them both upon their fondness for lonely places but perceiving that dolly had been weeping she immediately became grave and accommodated her looks and behavior to the gentle melancholy of her sister  sophia from the state of her own mind was but too much disposed to sympathize with the lovesick dolly these softening conversations were ill calculated to banish from her remembrance the first object of her innocent affections and who with all his faults she still loved dollys story awakened a thousand tender ideas and recalled to her memory every part of sir charless conduct which had any resemblance to that of the faithful and passionate william  she dwelt with tender regret upon these pleasing images and for a while forgot how necessary it was for her peace to suppress every thought of sir charles that tended to lessen her just resentment against him  but good and pious as she was the passion she could not wholly subdue she regulated by reason and virtue for as an eminent divine says although it is not in our power to make affliction no affliction yet we may take off the edge of it by a steady view of those divine joys prepared for us in another state  it was quite otherwise with sir sir charles for the guilty if unhappy are doubly so because they are deprived of those resources of comfort which the virtuous are sure to find in the consciousness of having acted well  sir charles upon finding his settlement sent back to him in such a manner as showed not only the most obstinate resolution to reject his offers but also a settled contempt for the offerer became a prey to the most violent passions rage grief affronted pride love ill requited and disappointed hope tormented him by turns nor was jealousy without a place in his heart the chaste the innocent the reserved sophia became suspected by the man who in vain attempted to corrupt her so true it is that libertinism gives such a color to the actions of others as takes away all distinction between virtue and vice  love he argued is either rewarded with a reciprocal affection or with an inward and secret contempt therefore he imputed sophias rejection of his offers not to her disapprobation of the intention of them but to want of affection for his person and from her youth and the tender sensibility of her heart he concluded that since he had failed in making an impression on it it was already bestowed upon another one while he resolved to think no more of her and repay her indifference and disdain with silence and neglect the next moment dreading lest he had lost her for ever he regretted his having alarmed her with too early a discovery of his intentions and sometimes his passion transported him so far as to make him think seriously of offering her his hand then starting at his own weakness and apprehensive of the consequences he sought to arm himself against that tenderness which suggested so mad a design by reflecting on her indifference toward him and accounting for it in such a manner as fixed the sharpest stings of jealousy in his mind  thus various and perplexed were his thoughts and designs and he was incapable of resolving upon any thing except to see her and so was his impatience that he would have set out for london the moment he received the fatal paper but decency would not permit him to leave his uncle who was in a dying condition and wished only to expire in his arms  the poor man however lingered a week longer during which sir charles passed some of the most melancholy hours he had ever known at length his uncles death left him at liberty to return to london which he did immediately and alighted at mrs darnleys house upon hearing she was at home he did not send in his name but walked up stairs with a beating heart he found mrs darnley and harriot together but not seeing the person whom he only wished to see he cast a melancholy look round the room and answering in a confused and dejected manner the mothers excessive politeness and the cold civility of the daughter he threw himself into a chair with a deep sigh and was silent  so evident a discomposure pleased mrs darnley as much as it mortified harriot as for sir charles pride and resentment hindered him at first from enquiring for sophia but his anxiety and impatience to hear of her soon prevailed over all other considerations and though he asked for her with an affected carelessness yet his eyes and the tone of his voice betrayed him  mrs darnley told him that she was gone into the country very much against my inclination said she but mr herbert who you know sir has great power over her more i think than i have would have it so  sir charles growing pale as death replied in great emotion what gone into the country where is she gone to whom why did she go against your inclination did you say madam what could possibly induce her to this you surprise me excessively  harriot who did not choose to be present at the explanation of this affair now rose up and went out of the room smiling sarcastically as she passed by sir charles and bridling with all the triumph of conscious beauty he who was in a bad humor beheld her airs not only with indifference but contempt which he suffered to appear pretty plain in his countenance for he thought it but just to mortify her for her ill usage of her sister without considering that he himself was far more guilty in that respect toward the amiable sophia and equally deserved to be hated by her  when harriot was gone mrs darnley instantly renewed the conversation concerning sophia and finding that the young baronet listened to her with eager attention she gave him a full account of all that had happened during his absence she represented sophia as having followed implicitly the directions of mr herbert whom she called a busy meddling officious old man and as the behavior of her daughter at her going away gave sufficient room to believe that her heart suffered greatly by the effort she made she dwelt upon every circumstance that tended to show the concern she was under and did not scruple to exaggerate where she thought it would be pleasing  sir charles though he inwardly rejoiced at what he heard yet dissembled so well that no signs of it appeared in his countenance he now seemed to listen with much indifference and coldly said he was sorry miss sophia would not permit him to make her easy  the tranquillity he affected alarmed mrs darnley she who was ever ready to judge by appearances concluded that all was over and that the baronet was irrecoverably lost but had her judgment been more acute she would have perceived that he was still deeply interested in every thing that related to sophia the questions he asked were not such as curiosity suggests but the tender anxiety of doubting love mrs darnley informed him of all he wished to hear sophia had indeed fled from him but not without reluctance and grief she was at present removed from his sight but she was removed to silence and solitude and she carried with her a fond impression which solitude would not fail to increase  thus satisfied he put an end to his visit with all imaginable composure leaving mrs darnley in doubt whether she should see him again and more enraged than ever with mr herbert whose fatal counsels had overthrown all her hopes  chap xv dolly meets her lover unexpectedly it was not long before sophia had an account of sir charless visit from her mother who forgetting the part she had acted before wrote her a letter full of invectives against her obstinacy and disobedience and bitter upbraidings of her folly for losing by her illtimed pride the heart of such a man as sir charles  she told her with a kind of exultation that he had entirely forgotten her and repeated every circumstance of his behavior while he was with her and every word he had spoke as all tending to show his indifference but though this was done to mortify sophia and make her repent of her precipitate departure yet her discernment and that facility which lovers have in flattering their own wishes pointed out to her many things in this minute relation which served rather to nourish hope than destroy it  mrs darnley added as the finishing stroke that sir charles looked pale and thin she attributed this alteration in his health to efforts he had made to banish her from his heart and thence inferred that a resolution which had cost him so much trouble to confirm would not be easily broke through and that she had no reason to expect he would ever desire to see her more  sophia could not read this part of the letter without tears tears that flowed from tender sensibility accompanied with a sensation which was neither grief nor joy but composed of both that sir charles should resolve to forget her was indeed afflicting but that this resolution should cost him struggles so painful as to affect his health could not but raise her depressed hopes since it showed the difficulty of the attempt and consequently that the success was doubtful  this letter gave so much employment to her thoughts that to be at liberty to indulge them she took her evening walk without soliciting the company of her beloved dolly and wandered far into the wood attracted by those romantic shades which afford such soothing pleasure to a lovesick mind here while she meditated on her mothers letter and read it over and over still seeking and still finding something new in it to engage her attention she heard the voices of some persons talking behind her and suddenly recollecting dollys adventure she began to be alarmed at the distance to which she had unwarily strayed and turned her steps hastily toward home  mean time a sudden gust of wind blew off her hat and carried it several paces back she turned in order to recover it and saw it taken up by a genteel young man who on a nearer approach she knew to be the lover of her young friend pleased at this encounter she advanced to receive her hat from him which he gave her with a blushing grace awed by the dignity of her mein and that sparkling intelligence which beamed in her eyes and seemed to penetrate into his inmost soul for sophia who was deeply interested for her innocent and unhappy friend considered him attentively and was desirous of entering into some conversation with him that she might be enabled to form a more exact judgment of his understanding and manners than she could from the accounts of the partial dolly  while she was talking to him they were joined by an ancient gentlewoman who accosting sophia told her in an affected style and formal accent that her nephew was very happy in having had an opportunity to do her this little piece of service  sophia who saw an old woman apparently oppressed with the infirmities of years dressed in all the ridiculous foppery of the last age was so little pleased with her that she would have answered this compliment with great coldness had not the desire and hope of being serviceable to her friend made her conquer her growing disgust she therefore resolved to improve this opportunity of commencing an acquaintance with the aunt of young william and met her advances with her usual sweetness and affability so that the old woman was quite charmed with her and being very desirous to gain her good opinion and to show her breeding of which she was extremely vain overwhelmed her with troublesome ceremony and to display her understanding of which she was equally proud murdered so many hard words that her discourse was scarcely intelligible  sophia would fain have drawn in the youth to partake of their conversation but his aunts volubility left him very little to say yet in that little sophia thought she discovered both good sense and politeness  the evening being now pretty far advanced sophia thought it time to separate and took leave of her new acquaintance their parting was protracted by so many courtesies and compliments from the old lady that her patience was almost wearied out at last she got free from her and quickened her pace toward home when on a sudden she heard her in a tremulous voice calling out madam madam pray stop one moment sophia looked back and seeing mrs gibbons come tottering up to her with more speed than was consistent with her weakness she met her half way and smiling asked her why she had turned back  oh madam replied she i am ready to sink with confusion what a solsim in good breeding have i committed to be sure you will think i have been used to converse with savages only sophia not able to guess what this speech tended to looked at mr gibbons as if she wished for an explanation  my aunt madam said the youth blushing a little at the old womans affectation is concerned that you should walk home alone and that i cannot offer my service to attend you being obliged to lead her as you see  that is not all nephew said the ceremonious gentlewoman you do not tell the young lady the true cause of the dilemnia i am in i would not leave you madam pursued she till i saw you safe home but you live with a family who has affronted me and i cannot endure to come within sight of the house i never can forgive an affront that would be to show i do not understand the laws of good breeding but i thank heaven no body can charge me with that i was very early instituted into polite life but some people are not to be assessed with  i hope said sophia scarce able to compose her countenance to any tolerable degree of seriousness that none of mr lawsons family have given you cause of complaint they seem to me incapable of affronting any one much more a person that   oh dear madam interrupted the old lady courtesying low you do me a great deal of honor but you will find nay you must have observed already that mrs lawson is vulgar very vulgar she knows nothing of decorums  i am very sorry for this misunderstanding between you said sophia and i should think it a very great happiness if i could be any way useful in renewing your friendship  oh cried mrs gibbons you might as well think of joining the antipoles madam as of bringing us together again and i am grieved beyond measure when i think that it is impossible for me to wait on you  however answered sophia you will have no objection i hope to my coming to see you  oh i must not admit of that by any means madam replied mrs gibbons you came last into the country and you are entitled to the first visit i would not for the world break through the laws of politeness i am sorry you have so indifferent an opinion of my breeding  sophia perceiving that the old gentlewoman was a little discomposed for this article of good breeding was a tender point with her endeavored to bring her into good humor by some welltimed compliments and once more took leave of her but mrs gibbons now insisted upon her nephews seeing her safe home saying she would rest herself under a tree till he came back  sophia but faintly declined this civility for she feared to offend her again and the joy that sparkled in williams eyes when his aunt made this offer of his attendance made her unwilling to disappoint him of the hope of seeing his mistress so after much ceremony on the part of mrs gibbons they separated  as they walked sophia took occasion to express her concern for the violent resentment his aunt had entertained against mr lawsons family and which seemed to make a reconciliation hopeless  the youth told her that nothing could be more trivial than the accident that had occasioned it and yet pursued he sighing deeply slight as it is the consequences are likely to be fatal enough  during their conversation sophia discovered so much good sense and delicacy of sentiment in the young william that she more than ever pitied the fate of these poor lovers whose happiness was sacrificed to the capricious temper of an affected old woman she assured him she would neglect no opportunity to improve her acquaintance with his aunt and perhaps said she with an enchanting smile that expressed the benevolence of her heart i may be so fortunate as to effect a reconciliation between her and my dollys family  mr gibbons thanked her in transports of joy and gratitude and now dolly and her sister who had walked out in search of sophia appearing in sight she mended her pace in order to come up with them soon for in the ardent glances that william sent toward his mistress she read his impatience to speak to her  dolly who was in the utmost surprise to see sophia thus accompanied took no notice of william but avoiding with a sweet bashfulness his earnest and passionate looks she fixed her eyes on miss darnley as if she wished to hear from her by what chance they had met  i know said sophia to her smiling that you did not expect to see me so agreeably engaged but mr gibbons can inform you how his aunt whom we left in the forest yonder and i became acquainted she then addressed some discourse to fanny to give the lovers an opportunity of talking to each other  dolly asked a thousand questions concerning their meeting and his aunts behavior to miss darnley but the passionate youth leaving it to sophia to satisfy her curiosity employed the few moments he had to stay with her in tender assurances of his own unaltered affection and complaints of her indifference  surely said dolly with tears in her eyes i ought not to be blamed for obeying my father  ah my dear dolly replied william our affections are not in the power of our fathers and if you hate me now because your father commands you to do so you never loved me  hate you cried dolly no mr william my father never bid me hate you and if he had i am sure i could not have obeyed him he only commanded me to forget you  only to forget me repeated william in a melancholy tone then you think that little dolly and perhaps you will be able to obey him but be assured i would rather be hated by you than forgotten  that is strange indeed said dolly smiling through her tears  you would not think it strange replied the youth in an accent that expressed at once grief and resentment if you had ever loved ah dolly are all your tender promises come to this little did i imagine i should ever see you altered thus but i will trouble you no more added he sighing as if his heart would break i will endeavor to follow your example perhaps it is not so difficult a thing as i imagined to cure ones self of love you have shown me it is possible and if i fail in the attempt i can be but miserable and that you have made me now as he spoke these words he turned half from her and let fall some tears  dolly who had no intention to make him uneasy was excessively affected with this sight and not a little alarmed at what he had said and will you said she in the most moving tone imaginable will you try to forget me then indeed you will be false and perjured too for you have sworn a thousand times that you would love me for ever  why should you wish to see me wretched said he you have resolved to love me no longer and it is but reasonable that i should try to forget you  he would have proceeded in this strain but turning to look on her he saw her sweet face overspread with tears oh my dolly cried he we are very cruel to each other but i am most to blame can you pardon me my dearest say you can alas i know i do not deserve it  dollys heart was so oppressed that she was not able to speak but she held out her hand to her young lover who seizing it eagerly pressed it to his lips yes i will love you said he though you should hate me i will love you to my latest breath  dolly perceiving sophia and her sister coming up to them drew away her hand hastily but looked on him at the same time with inexpressible tenderness sophia told him with a smile that she was afraid his aunt would be impatient upon which he made his bow and hastened back to her  chap xvi dolly concludes her story fanny now left her sister alone with miss darnley who perceiving that she had been weeping asked her tenderly the cause oh my dear miss said the poor girl blushing and pressing her hand if i had but a little of your prudence and good sense i should obey my father better but when one has once given ones heart it is very difficult to recall it  very true my dear said sophia therefore one ought not to be in haste to give it  i hope interrupted dolly with an anxious look you have observed nothing in mr william to make you change your good opinion of him  quite the contrary said sophia i believe him to be a good and i am sure he is a sensible youth nay more i believe he has a sincere regard for you and that pursued she sighing is saying a great deal considering what reason i have to judge unfavourably of men but my dear i would have you keep your passion so far subjected to your reason as to make it not too difficult for you to obey your father if he is fully determined to refuse his consent i know added she with a gentle smile that it is easier to be wife for others than for ourselves but i know it is not impossible for a heart in love to follow the dictates of reason i think so highly of mr lawsons understanding and goodness that i am persuaded he would not lay an unreasonable command upon you and by what i could collect from some hints dropped by mrs gibbons and the little discourse i had with your lover the old gentlewoman is wholly to blame  did mr william tell you said dolly what was the occasion of their quarrel  no replied sophia i should be glad to hear it from yourself  well resumed dolly taking her under the arm let us go to our dear oak then and there we shall be out of sight but i am impatient to know how you met and what conversation you had sophia satisfied her curiosity diverting herself a little with the old ladys hard words and her strict regard to ceremony  ah said dolly it was those hard words and the clutter she made about ceremony and decorum that occasioned all our unhappiness for as i told you miss she was well enough pleased with her nephews choice saying that he was in the right to marry like a gentleman and prefer person and breeding to money however soon after she came into the country she showed herself a little dissatisfied with my education and said that as my father was a gentleman and a scholar he ought to have taught his daughters a little greek and latin to have distinguished them from mere country girls  your mother i supppose said sophia laughed at this notion  it does not become me said dolly to blame my mother but to be sure she took great delight in ridiculing mrs gibbons indeed it was scarce possible to help smiling now and then at her hard words and her formal politeness but my mother as mr william often told me with great concern carried her raillery so far that his aunt would certainly be offended with it at last and so indeed she was and grew every day cooler with regard to the marriage this disgusted my mother more so every thing wore a melancholy appearance at length mrs gibbons broke out one day violently upon my mothers sending a dish of tea to another gentlewoman before her i saw a storm in her countenance and dreading the consequence i made haste to carry her her dish myself but she refused it scornfully and then began to attack my mother in her strange language upon her want of breeding and ignorance of the rules of precendency that was her word my mother at first only laughed and rallied but when the rest of our visitors was gone and mrs gibbons only remained the quarrel grew serious my mother who was out of patience with her folly said some severe things which provoked mrs gibbons so much that she rose up in a fury and declared she would never more any have collection with such vulgar creatures at that moment my father and mr william who had been walking together came into the room they both were excessively surprised at the disorder which appeared among us and poor mr william who was most apprehensive turned as pale as death he gave me a melancholy look as fearing what had happened and had scarce courage enough to ask his aunt what was the matter mean time my mother in a laughing way gave my father an account of what had happened repeating some of mrs gibbonss strange words and made the whole affair appear so ridiculous that mrs gibbons in a great fury flung out of the house declaring that from that moment she broke of any treatise of marriage between her nephew and me and that if he continued to make his addresses to me she would make a will and leave all her money to a distant relation mr william was obliged to follow his aunt but he begged my fathers leave to return as soon as he had seen her safe home when he came back he implored my father with tears in his eyes not to forbid his seeing me he said the loss of his aunts fortune would give him no concern if he durst hope that it would make no alteration in my fathers resolutions since his own little inheritance was sufficient to maintain us comfortably my father was pleased with his generous affection for me and said a great many obliging things to him as did my mother likewise so that we thought our misfortune not so bad but the next day old farmer gibbons came plodding to our house and with a great deal of confusion and aukwardness told my father that he was very sorry for what had happened but sister had changed her mind and would not let her nephew marry and he was afraid if he disobliged her she would leave all her money to strangers so he begged him to give his son no encouragement but to tell him plainly he must obey his aunt and his father and he said he was sure his son would mind what my father said to him more than any body else  i am in pain for poor mr lawson said sophia what a boorish speech was this  my father resumed dolly said afterward that if it had not been for the concern he felt for me and mr william he should have been excessively diverted with the old mans simplicity but he answered him gravely and with great civility he promised him that the affair should go no farther that i should receive no more visits from his son and that he would talk with him and endeavor to make him submit patiently to what his father and his aunt had determined for him the old man thanked my father a thousand times over for his kindness and after a great many bows and scrapes he went away my father was as good as his word he laid his commands on me to think no more of mr william and forbad me to see or speak to him and when mr william came next he took him with him into his study and talked to him a long time he acknowledged that mr william had oftener than once moved him even to tears but for all that he did not relent and we were not allowed so much as to speak to each other alone for fear we should take any measures to meet in private this i thought very severe pursued dolly sighing we might at least have been indulged in taking leave since we were to be separated for ever  i cannot blame your father said sophia he was indispensably obliged to act as he did it is to be wished indeed that mrs lawson had passed over the poor womans follies with more temper but this cannot be helped now perhaps i may be able to serve you the old gentlewoman seems to have taken a liking to me i shall endeavor to improve it that i may have an optunity to soften her it is not impossible but this matter may end well yet  chap xvii mrs darnley and harriot resolve to visit sophia poor dolly was ready enough to admit a hope so pleasing and felt her heart more at ease than it had been a long time as for william his aunts extravagant praises of sophia and some expressions which she dropped intimating that she should be pleased if he could make himself acceptable to so fine a lady hinted to him a scheme which might afford him the means of seeing his mistress sometimes he seemed therefore to listen with satisfaction to these dark overtures made by his aunt and upon her speaking still plainer he said it would be presumption in him to think that a young lady so accomplished as miss darnley would look down upon him and besides he had no opportunity of improving an acquaintance with her being forbid mr lawsons house at her request  the old woman pleased to find he made so little opposition to her desire told him that he would have opportunities enough of seeing and conversing with the lady she often walks out said she either in the forest or the fields about the house cannot you throw yourself in her way and accost her politely as you very well know how and to felicitate your success i will let her know that i am willing to receive the honor of a visit from her though this is against all the rules of decorum for it is my part to visit her first she being the greatest stranger here you shall deliver my message to her tomorrow yourself  the youth replied coldly that it was possible he might not meet with her tomorrow nevertheless he would go every day to the forest and wherever it was likely she would walk in hopes of seeing her  mrs gibbons exulting in the hope of mortifying mrs lawson told her nephew that if he could succeed in his addresses to miss darnley and give her so fine a lady for a niece she would settle the best part of her fortune on him immediately  william suffered her to please herself with these imaginations having secured the liberty of going unsuspected and as often as he pleased to those places where he could see his beloved dolly hitherto he had not dared to indulge himself frequently in these stolen interviews lest his aunt being informed of them should take measures to engage mr lawson to keep his daughter under a greater restraint but now he continually haunted the park the wood and the fields about mr lawsons house here he could not fail of often seeing his mistress and sometimes of speaking to her unobserved by any one  dolly never failed to chide him as often as this happened for thus laying her under a necessity of disobeying her fathers injunctions but she took no pains to shun those places where she was almost sure of meeting him and her chiding was so gentle that he was convinced she was not greatly offended  sophia happening to meet him one morning while he was thus sauntering about she enquired for his aunt and hearing from him how desirous the old gentlewoman was of seeing her she who was full of her benevolent scheme and eager to put it in execution delayed her visit no longer than till the afternoon  mrs gibbons considered this as a proof of her nephews sincerity and was in so good a humor that she listened without any signs of displeasure to the praises which sophia artfully introduced of dolly and even sometimes joined in them sophia thought this a very favorable beginning and went away full of hope that she should succeed in her design but while she was thus endeavoring to make others happy her sister was preparing a new mortification for her  sir charles continued to visit mrs darnley as usual he passed some hours every day at her house and while he applauded himself for the steadiness of his resolution not to follow his mistress he perceived not his own weakness in seeking every alleviation of her absence he went to the house where she had formerly dwelt because every object he saw in it brought her dear idea to his mind he loved to turn over the books he had seen her read to sit in those places where she used to sit he was transported when he saw any thing that belonged to her and when he was not observed by the inquisitive eyes of harriot he indulged his own in gazing upon sophias picture faintly as it expressed the attractive graces of the original he endured the trifling discourse of mrs darnley and the insipid gaiety of harriot and left all other company and amusements to converse with them that he might hear something concerning sophia for he had the art without seeming to design it to turn the discourse frequently upon her and thus drew from the loquacious mother all he desired to know without appearing to be interested in it  mrs darnley knew not what judgment to form of his assiduity in visiting her and vainly endeavored to penetrate into his views as for harriot who had no idea of those refinements of
