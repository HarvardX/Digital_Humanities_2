an essay concerning the nature of aliments and the choice of them according to the different constitutions of human bodies  in which the different effects advantages and disadvantages of animal and vegetable diet are explained  by john arbuthnot m d fellow of the college of physicians and of the royal society  london printed for j tonson in the strand  mdccxxxi  the preface what gave occasion to the following essay is briefly what follows my learned and worthy friend dr cheyne some rears ago published an essay upon health and long life in which he gave a proof both of his judgment and humanity this book was received by the public with the respect that was due to the importance of its contents it became the subject of conversation and produced even sects in the dietetick philosophy in some of those symposiac disputations amongst my acquaintance being appealed to i happened to affirm that the dietetick part of medicine depended as much as any of the rest upon scientifick principles being called upon to make good my assertion i composed the following short treatise which is properly speaking only an essay or attempt of a physiology of aliment the most of it was wrote in a situation where i had no assistance except from extracts out of some imperfect editions of the works of the most learned and industrious boerhaave and from a very excellent edition of his chemistry by dr shaw and mr chambers this i am obliged to say once for all to save my self the trouble of perpetual quotations the circumstances of ill health and absence from my books in which i composed it and the want of leisure since to correct it sufficiently may he some excuse for the want of that accuracy which the subject deserves and which i frankly own i have discovered in some things of small moment since the book was printed off i am likewise obliged to make use of a very common and trivial reason for publishing it at this time viz the approbation of some friends who perused it and persuaded me that it might be of some use to the public i can say but little of the merit of the performance but a great deal of that of the subject for surely the choice and measure of the materials of which the whole body is composed and what we take daily by pounds is at least of as much importance as of what we take seldom and only by grains and spoonfuls  the reader must not be surpised to find the most common and ordinary facts taken notice of in subjects of this nature there is no room for invention many important consequences may be drawn from the observation of the most common things and analogous reasonings from the causes of them  i believe a reader with as much anatomy as a butcher knows and moderate skill in mechanics may understand the whole essay provided he goes through it at leisure and with attention to a person so qualified many observations concerning his own constitution will occur which i was not capable of making as for the hard words which i was obliged to use they are either terms of art or such as i substituted in the place of others that were too low and vulgar the reader will find most of them explained at the beginning of the book and i hope an indulgence to a few will not be reckoned an indignity to the rest and that i shall not be suspected of affectation where my principal intention was perspicuity in subjects of this kind one is obliged in the same paragraph to join many particulars together in one proposition because the repetition of the substantive verb would be tedious and unnecessary this hinders the style from being smooth but not from being perspicuous  i have laid a plan for treating the other parts of diet as air rest and motion after the same manner but i am obliged to delay the execution of my design till i have more leisure  i do not presume to instruct the gentlemen of my own profession and if any of them shall instruct me better i declare beforehand that i am very willing to be convinced i will not defend any mistake and at the same time i do not think my self obliged to answer every frivolous objection  the contents chap i observations drawn from the alterations which the aliment undergoes in

tophaceous chalky gritty v villous douny with a pile like velvet viscidity a sticking or gluish quality the explanation of some chemical terms used in the following essay as the following treatise is chiefly designed for persons not bred up in the profession of physic it is necessary to give a general notion of the meaning of some chemical words that frequently occur in it  the principles of natural bodies according to the chemists are water earth oil salt spirit of all which every one has some general notion but the diversity of the names and qualities of salts and spirits occasions some confusion in the minds of such as are ignorant of chemistry  the chemists define salt from some of its properties to be a body fusible in the fire congealable again by cold into britle glebes or crystals soluble in water so as to disappear not malleable and having something in it which affects the organs of taste with a sensation of acrimony or sharpness of native salts there are  first sea salt and sal gemmae or rocksalt which are of the same nature the first in all appearance being a solution of the second in the water of the ocean these two are perfect salts fixed and immutable by any power in animal bodies for the other salts are never found in the urine of any animal that swallows them down but sea salt is always found in the urine of every animal that takes it and in no other  secondly sal nitre or sal petre which is more easily dissolved by fire and less easily by water than any other salt it is cold and affects the tongue like a saltish ice it seems to be of a middle nature between fossile and animal being producible from animal excrements intermixed with vegetable salts  thirdly sal ammoniac of two sorts the ancient described by pliny and dioscorides no more to be found and the modern which is a compound of fossile animal and vegetable salt this salt cools water it is fixed in a gentle fire and sublimes in a great one its taste is quicker than that of common salt resembling that of urine  fourthly borax a fossile salt of a sweetish taste it promotes the fusion of metals  fifthly alum which though no pure salt has most of the properties of salts being soluble in water etc  salts are divided into acid and alkaline of acid or sour one has a notion from taste sourness being one of those simple ideas which one cannot more plainly describe what being mixed with an acid causes an effervescence is called an alkali  effervescence in the chemical sense signifies an intestine commotion produced by mixing two bodies together that lay at rest before attended sometimes with a hissing noise froathing and ebullition for example let us place in the first class acids as vinegar juice of lemons juice of oranges spirit of nitre spirit of alum in the second class other saline substances obtained from animals and vegetables by distillation putrefaction calcination as spirit of urine spirit of hartshorn salt of tartar because the substances of the second class being mixed with the substances of the first raise an effervescence they are called alkalis there is a third class of substances commonly called absorbents as the various kinds of shells coral chalk crabseyes etc which being mixed with the first class likewise raise an effervescence and are therefore called alkalis though not so properly for they are not salts and have nothing common with the second class except this quality of fermenting with acids  it is observable that a violent cold as well as heat may be produced by this ebullition for if sal ammoniac or any pure volatile alkali dissolved in water be mixed with an acid an ebullition with a great degree of cold will ensue therefore i think with leave of the chemists effervescence not so proper a word to express this intestine motion there is another criterion of acid and alkali by the change of color which they produce in some bodies for example those liquors which being poured to the syrup of violets turn it red are acids those which change it into a green color are reckoned alkalis thus oil of vitriol syrup of violets red and oil of tartar green  the word alkali comes from an herb called by the egyptians kali this herb they burnt to ashes boiled them in water and after having evaporated the water there remained at the bottom a white salt this they called sal kali or alkali it is corrosive producing putrefaction in animal substances to which it is applied  substances which are not perfectly acid but naturally turn so i call acescent substances which are not perfectly alkaline but naturally turn so i call alkalescent  these are not qualities in bodies merely imaginary but have very different and contrary effects upon human bodies  salts which are neither acid nor alkaline are called neutral so are sal ammoniac sea salt sal gemmae borax alum nitre which as long as they retain their saline quality are neither acid nor alkaline but the chemical products of them all except sal ammoniac are generally acid  fixed salts are such as sustain the fire without flying away  volatile salts fly away with a small heat affecting the nose with an urinous smell  there are volatile and fixed alkalis  the essential salts of plants are such as shoot upon the sides of the vessels which contain their expressed juices  in distillations what trickles down the sides of the receiver in certain unctious rivulets if it will not mix with water it is called oil if it will mix with water it is called spirits spirits are either inflammable or not inflammable the last either acid or alkaline alkaline spirits are subtle volatile liquors that run in veins down the sides of the receiver in distillations which will not take fire mix with water and contain some alkaline salt as spirit of hartshorn such are obtained from all the parts of animals from all plants by putrefaction and from the pungent kind as mustard horseradish etc without it acid spirits are subtle liquors which come over in distillations not inflammable miscible with water such are obtained from vegetables distilled with water and likewise from fossils inflammable spirits are subtle volatile liquors which come over in distillations miscible with water and wholly combustible such spirits are obtainable from plants by a previous fermentation and not without it by the spirit of a plant or that of an animal we understand that pure elaborated oil which by reason of its extreme volatility exhales spontaneously in which the odor or smell consists  soap is a mixture of a fixed alkaline salt and oil in common use its virtues are cleansing penetrating attenuating and resolving any mixture of any oily substance with salt may be called a soap  bodies of this nature are called saponaceous  he who would skilfully treat of the nature and choice of different sorts of aliment ought to draw his observations from the following particulars first from the alterations which the aliment undergoes in its passage into the blood secondly from the alteration it undergoes during its circulation with the blood thirdly from the nature and most simple analysis of vegetable substances fourthly from the nature and most simple analysis of animal substances fifthly he ought to treat of the effects of different sorts of alimentary substanees upon the fluids and solids of a human body sixthly of the different intentions to be pursued in the choice of aliment in different constitutions though i have neither time ability nor observations sufficient to handle those particulars so fully as they deserve i hope at least to give a specimen how they ought to be treated  this is agreeable to the doctrine of hippocrates who tells you in his first book of diet that to write duly upon it one must understand the nature of aliment and of the person it is given to  for the ease of the reader i have set down every thing in distinct propositions with inferences and observations the first in roman the other in common numbers  errata page     line    dele the first more  page     line   dele such as have  page     line    dele such as have  an essay concerning the nature of aliments and the choice of them according to the different constitutions of human bodies chap i observations drawn from the alterations which the aliment undergoes in its passage into the blood prop i mastication is a very necessary preparation of solid aliment without which there can be no good digestion by chewing solid aliment is divided into small parts in a human body there is no other instrument to perform this action but the teeth by the action of chewing the spittle and mucus is squeezed from the glands and mixed with the aliment which action if it be long continued will turn the aliment into a sort of chyle the spittle is an active liquor immediately derived from the arterial blood it is saponaceous as appears by its froathing and likewise by distillation and consequently is attenuating resolving penetrating and deterging after long abstinence it is extremely acrid and copious it ferments with the juices of vegetables and consequently disposes them to be changed into inflamable spirits it discovers its virtues in several chirurgical uses besides in the action of chewing the mucus which is an humor different from the spittle and by its viscidity collects air mixeth with the aliment and helps to attenuate it the necessity of saliva or spittle to dissolve the aliment appears from the contrivance of nature in making the salivary ducts of animals which ruminate or chew the cud extremely open such animals as swallow their aliment without chewing want salivary glands and birds have them placed in their maw there are instances of men who swallowed their meat whole but ruminated or chewed the cud afterward rumination is given to animals to enable them at once to lay up a great store of food and afterward to chew it and animals ruminate more upon hay than grass the food being harder from all which observations it appears that the solution of the aliment by mastication is very necessary and that without it the aliment could not be duly disposed for the other changes which it receives as it passes through the alimentary duct  first a great loss of spittle causes a decay of appetite this has been confirmed by experience in several who have made it their constant custom to chew mastick chewing and smoking of tobacco is only good in phlegmatic people  secondly the humor of salivation is not properly spittle but putrified blood  thirdly the depravation of the instruments of mastication by a paralytical disposition or by the want of teeth as in old men and infants is a natural indication of a liquid diet as of milk and broaths and even such of them as take solids ought to chew in order to make an expression of the spittle  prop ii the change which is made of the aliment in the stomach is effected by attrition of the solid parts or inward coat of the stomach and the action of a dissolvent liquor assisted with heat  the liquor in the stomach consists of that which is separated from its inward coat of the spittle which is almost continually swallowed and the liquor which distills from the gullet by the help of this liquor and the constant attrition of the solid parts the aliment is dissolved by an operation resembling that of making an emulsion in which operation the oily parts of nutts and seeds being gently ground in a marble mortar and gradually mixed with some watery liquor are dissolved into a sweet thick turbid milky liquor resembling the chyle in an animal body that the stomach in animals levigates the substances which it receives is evident from the dissection of some animals which have swallowed metals which have been found polished on the side next the stomach birds being without teeth to make the first preparation of their aliment have strong and nervous stomachs to make this attrition the stronger and this motion in them has been both seen and heard the rugae or plyes of the inward coat of the stomach contribute to the detaining the aliment in the stomach the heat in land animals helps likewise to the solution of the aliment but not much for fishes have a strong digestion without it though by the trial of the thermoscope they have more heat than the element which they swim in it has been showed before that the spittle is a great dissolvent and there is a great quantity of it in the stomach being swallowed constantly at least in sleep he who eats a pound of bread swallows at least as much spittle as bread this liquor of the stomach in a sound state is not acid for it has been found by experiments that pearls have passed through cocks and hens undissolvd    the liquor of the stomach which with fasting grows extremely acrid and the quick sensation of the inward villous coat of the stomach seem to be the cause of the sense of hunger    such as have by the use of spirituous liquors weakened and destroyed some of the solid parts of the stomach cannot recover a right digestion for this inward villous coat when destroyed cannot be restored    this liquor of the stomach may by reason of some saline acrimony be made of some determined quality and affect human creatures with appetites of other animals which in that case they can take without hurt or it may likewise occasion an exorbitant appetite of usual things which they will take in such quantities till they vomit it up like dogs from whence it is called canine in the first case the organs of taste are vitiated both diseases are cured by diet opposite to this acrimony whether alkaline acid or muriatick    thirst and hunger denote the state of the spittle and liquor of the stomach thirst is the sign of an acrimony commonly alkalescent or muriatick    a paralytical disposition of the nerves of the stomach a depraved condition of the liquor of the stomach something viscous fat and oily remaining there destroys the sensation of hunger    the action of the stomach is totally stopped by too great repletion in which case both the orifices of the stomach by a necessary mechanism close and neither will admit nor expel any thing in which case relaxing as by warm water is the only proper expedient  the signs of the functions of the stomach being depraved are pains in the stomach many hours after repast eructations either with the taste of the aliment acid nidorose or foetid resembling the taste of rotten eggs inflations or the sensation of fullness sickness hickup vomiting a flushing in the countenance foulness of the tongue in general whatever be the state of the tongue the same is that of the inward coat of the stomach when the taste of the mouth is bitter it is a sign of a redundance of a bilious alkali and demands a quite different diet from the case of acidity or sowerness  prop iii by digestion in the alimentary duct the specific difference of all substances is abolished and the whole action resembles putrefaction  digestion is a fermentation begun because there is all the requisites of such a fermentation heat air and motion but it is not a complete fermentation because that requires a greater time than the continuance of the aliment in the stomach vegetable putrefaction resembles very much animal digestion vegetable putrefaction is produced by throwing green succulent vegetables in a heap in open warm air and pressing them together by which all vegetables acquire first a heat equal to that of a human body secondly a putrid stercoraceous taste and odor in taste resembling putrid flesh and in smell human foeces this putrid matter being distilled affords first a water impregnated with an urinous spirit like that obtainable from animal substances which water is seperable into elementary water and a volatile animal salt secondly a volatile oily alkaline salt thirdly a volatile thick oil fourthly the remainder being calcined affords no fixed salt in short every thing happens as if the subject had not been vegetable but animal putrefaction utterly destroys the specific difference of one vegetable from another converting them into a pulpy substance of an animal nature making the same alteration very near as if the vegetable had gone through the body of a sound animal for though such an animal should entirely live upon acids no part of its body affords any acid fixed salt vide philosophical transactions this is so far true that even the herbs taken out of the omasus of ruminating animals afford the same contents as putrefied vegetables but though this action of putrefaction comes the nearest to animal digestion it so far differs from it that the salts and oils are only detained in the animal body so long as they remain benign and friendly to it but as soon as they putrefy entirely are either thrown off or must produce mortal distempers  prop iv the gall is the principal dissolvent of the aliment and when it is peccant or deficient there can be no right digestion  the bile is of two sorts the cystick or that contained in the gallbladder which is a sort of repository for the gall and the hepatick or what flows immediately from the liver the cystick gall is thick and intensly bitter so that one drop of it will make a whole pint of water bitter the hepatick gall is more fluid and not so bitter there is no other bitter humor in a human body besides gall except the wax of the ear the gall is not a perfect alkali for it does not ferment with an acid but it is alkalescent entirely opposite to acescents and soon corruptible and convertible into a corrosive alkali it is a saponaceous substance being composed of an alkaline salt oil and water all which can be extracted from it the bile like soap takes out spots from wool or silk and the painters use it to mix their colors by this saponaceous quality it mixeth the oily and watery parts of the aliment together but though the bile be an oil it is not combustible till dry these qualities make it a most powerful and proper dissolvent which appears by experience the milk in the stomach of calves which is coagulated by the runnet is again dissolved and rendered fluid by the gall in the duodenum voracious animals and such as do not chew have a great quantity of gall and some of them have the biliary duct inserted into the pylorus it is likewise the chief instrument by its irritation of the peristaltick motion of the guts such as have the bile peccant or deficient are relieved by bitters which are a sort of subsidiary gall the learned boorhaave has found the gall of an eel which is most intensely bitter a most effectual remedy in such cases the common symptoms of the excretion of the bile being vitiated are a yellowish color of the skin white hard foeces a loss of appetite a lixivial urine  prop v the bile is so acrid that of itself it could not be admitted into the lacteal vessels therefore nature has furnished another humor viz the pancreatick juice to temper its bitterness and acrimony after it has done its office  the pancreas is a large salivary gland separating about a pound of an humor like spittle in twelve hours the bile mixed with spittle loses its bitterness in time and even wormwood eat with bread will do so because it is mixed with a great quantity of spittle the pancreatick juice likewise mixeth the parts of the aliment rendering the chyle homogeneous when the bile is not separated in the liver the foeces are white but this is not occasioned by the mixture of the pancreatick juice  prop vi acrimony and tenacity are the two qualities in what we take inwardly most to be avoided  the papillous inward coat of the intestines is extremely sensible and when the acrimony is so great as to affect the solid parts the sensation of pain is intolerable the peristaltick motion of the guts and the continual expression of the fluids will not suffer the least matter to be applied to one point the least instant of time for the smallest quantity of turpentine or pitch will stick to the fingers but not to the guts but this motion in some human creatures may be weak in respect to the viscidity of what is taken so as not to be able to propell it the consequence of which is dangerous and perhaps fatal to the life of the creature substances hard cannot be dissolved but they will pass but such whose tenacity exceeds the powers of digestion will neither pass nor be converted into aliment besides the mouths of the lacteals may permit aliment too acrimonious or not sufficiently attenuated to enter in people of lax constitutions whereas their sphincters will shut against them in such as have strong fibers the mouths of the lacteals may be shut up by a viscid mucus in which case the chyle passes by stool and the person falls into an atrophy    fat or oil is necessary as for animal motion so likewise for this peristaltick motion of the intestines and lean people often suffer for want of it as fat people may by obstruction of the vessels the omentum will melt by strong motion as has been found in horses by hard running    this peristaltick motion or repeated changes of contraction and dilatation is not the lower guts else one would have a continual needing to go to stool wind and distention of the bowels are signs of a bad digestion in the intestines for in dead animals when there is no digestion at all the distention is in the greatest extremity and diarhaeas which proceed from acrimony laxity of the bowels or obstruction of the lacteals  prop vii the mechanism of nature in converting our aliment into animal substances consists chiefly in two things first by mixing constantly with it animal juices already prepared secondly by the action of the solid parts as it were churning them together this is evident if we consider first the vast quantity of saliva mixed with the aliment in chewing he that eats a pound of bread mixeth it very near with as much spittle and this separated from glands that weigh only about four ounces afterward the same aliment is mixed with the liquor of the stomach the bile and pancreatick juice and if we compute the quantity of bile and pancreatick from the weight of these viscera in respect of the salivary glands we shall find still a vastly greater quantity of these animal juices mixed with the aliment this is not all for when the chyle passes through the mesentery it is mixed with the lymph which is the most spirituous and elaborated part of the blood from the glands of the mesentery so that the juices of an animal body are as it were i e new distilled cohobated being excreted and admitted again into the blood with the fresh aliment all the while the solid parts act upon the mixture of aliment and animal juices so as to make the mixture more perfect besides none of these juices except the liquor of the intestines are mixed with the foeces of an animal which in a sound state are hard so that one may compute that a pound of bread before it enters the blood is mixed perhaps with four times the quantity of animal juices the same economy is observed in the circulation of the chyle with the blood by mixing it intimately with the parts of the fluid to which it is to be assimilated    from whence it follows that an animal whose juices are unsound or solid parts weak can never be duly nourished for unsound juices can never duly repair the fluids and solids of an animal body and without a due action of the solid parts they never can be well mixed the stomach the intestines the muscles of the lower belly all act upon the aliment besides the chyle is not sucked but squeezed into the mouths of the lacteals by the action of the fibers of the guts the mouths of the lacteals are opened by the intestinal tube affecting a straight instead of a spiral cylinder thus it is plain that the chyle must be peccant in quantity or quality when these actions and organs are too weak and whatever strengthens the solid parts must help the digestion    diarhaeas and strong purgations must spoil the first digestion because of the great quantities of animal liquids which they expel out of the body a vast quantity and variety of animal liquors are carried off by purging air spittle mucus all the liquors that are separated in the glands of the alimentary duct both sorts of bile the pancreatick juice lymph and sometimes blood computing the quantity of these secretions makes it plain that the whole juices may be carried off by purging and when those liquors are expelled out of the body which by their mixture convert the aliment into an animal liquid this cannot so well be performed    the peristaltick motion of the intestines is the last that cease in an animal body for it remains after the motion of the heart is ceased by the entry of the chyle and air into the blood by the lacteals the animal may again revive  the obstruction of the glands of the mesentery is a great impediment to nutrition for the lymph in those glands is a necessary constituent of the aliment before it mixeth with the blood and for the same reason young animals are most and best nourished for the mesenterick glands are largest in the vigor of youth in old age they vanish and are liable to obstructions therefore scrophulous persons can never be duly nourished for such as have tumors in the parotids often have them in the pancreas and mesentery    in tabid persons milk is the best restorative for it is chyle already prepared if a nurse after being sucked dry eats broth the infant will suck the broth almost unaltered    the chyle by reason of the smoothness of its particles is white it grows more gray in the thoracick duct where it still retains the flavor of the aliment    animals which take a large quantity of aliment by the mouth may be less nourished than those that take a smaller for according to the force of the which make the chyle chylopooetick organs a larger or less quantity of chyle may be extracted from the same quantity of food  astriction of the belly is commonly a sign of strong chylopooetick organs  prop viii the most subtle part of the chyle passes immediately into the blood by the absorbent vessels of the guts which discharge themselves into the meseraick veins their largeness and number demonstrate this for they are numerous and vastly larger than their correspondent arteries besides wherever there are emissaries there are absorbent vessels ex gr in the skin by the absorbent vessels of which mercury will pass into the blood  birds which have strong and large breasts small bellies and their ribs upon their backs have no lacteals nor thoracick duct and their aliment passes immediately into the meseraick veins if one considers the capacity of the thoracick duct and the slowness of the passage of the aliment by the lacteals through it and at the same time the great quantity of some liquors as of chalybeat water which in some pass in a small time by urine by an easy calculation he will be able to demonstrate that such a quantity could not pass into the blood by the thoracick duct in so short a time  therefore when the intention is to give an immediate refreshment to the spirits as after great abstinence and fatigue thin or liquid aliment is the properest and for the same reason chalybeat waters seem to be a proper remedy in hypochondrical cases their subtle and divided particles are taken immediately into the miseraick vessels and carried straight into the liver and spleen  chap ii observations drawn from the circulation of the chyle with the blood prop i the chyle of it self cannot pass through the smallest vessels for it neither will pass by urine nor sweat therefore it cannot nourish the animal till it is converted into blood and it is converted into blood by the mechanism of nature above described viz by intimately mixing it with the particles of the liquor to which it is to be assimilated as will appear by what follows  prop ii the lungs are the first and chief instrument of sanguification  the chyle first mixeth with the blood in the subclavian veins and enters with it into the heart where it is very imperfectly mixed there being no mechanism nor fermentation by extraordinary heat etc to convert it immediately into blood which is first effected by the lungs the windpipe divides it self into a great number of branches called bronchia these end in small airbladders dilatable and contractible capable to be inflated by the admission of air and to subside at the expulsion of it the pulmonary artery and vein pass along the surfaces of these airbladders in an infinite number of ramifications a great number of those airbladders form what we call lobuli which hang upon the bronchia like bunches of grapes upon a stalk these lobuli constitute the lobes and the lobes the lungs let us see what effect an engine so contrived will have upon the crude mixture of blood and chyle first as the blood and chyle pass through the ramifications of the pulmonary artery they will be still more perfectly mixed a red liquor and a white liquor passing through only one tube will both retain their original colors but if this pipe is divided into branches and these again subdivided the red and white liquors as they pass through the ramifications will be more intimately mixed and both colors will be blended together the more ramifications the mixture will be the more perfect but this is not all for as this mixture of blood and chyle passes through the arterial tube it is pressed by two contrary forces that of the heart driving it forward against the sides of the tube and the elastick force of the air pressing it on the opposite side of those airbladders along the surface of which as was said before this arterial tube creeps by those two opposite forces the parts of the liquor are compressed together and as it were churnd and more intimately mixed moreover by the alternate motion of those airbladders whose surfaces are by turns freed from mutual contact and by a sudden subsidence meet again by the ingress and egress of the air the liquor is still further attenuated dissolved and changed into a homogeneous fluid    the force of the air upon the pulmonary artery is but small in respect of that of the heart but it is still something and whatever the effect of it be it increases and diminishes with the gravity of the air to which the elasticity is proportional  as to the admittance of the weighty and elastick parts of the air into the blood through the coats of the vessels it seems contrary to experience the spumous and florid state which the blood acquires in passing through the lungs is easily accounted for from its own elasticity and the violent motion before described the aerial particles in the blood and chyle expanding themselves that the air in the blood vessels has a communication with the outward air i think seems plain from the experiments of human creatures being able to bear air of much greater density in diving and of much less upon the tops of mountains provided the changes be made gradually otherwise the air within the vessels being of a less density the outward air would press their sides together and being of a greater density would expand them so as to endanger the life of the animal    as much blood passes through the lungs as through all the rest of the body the circulation is quicker and heat greater and their texture is extremely delicate upon all which accounts they are extremely sensible of any force either from the too violent motion or acrimony of the blood    since the lungs are the first and chief instrument of sanguification the animal that has that organ faulty can never be duly nourished nor have the vital juices which are all derived from the blood in a good state and this is true understanding the lungs only as an instrument of digestion and abstracting from an acrid and purulent matter that mixeth with the blood in such as have their lungs ulcerated therefore such as have a faulty circulation through the lungs ought to eat very little at a time because the increase of the quantity of fresh chyle must make that circulation still more uneasy which indeed is the case of consumptive and some asthmatick persons and accounts for the symptoms they are troubled with after eating the great rule of diet for consumptive people and upon which the whole cure depends is taking their aliment in small quantities it happens very often unfortunately for asthmatick persons that they have voracious appetites and consequently for want of a right sanguification are often leucophlegmatick    the choice as well as quantity of diet is of great importance to such as have weak lungs for it was observed chap i prop vii   that the chyle in the thoracick duct retained the original taste of the aliment which not being yet converted into blood and entirely subdued by circulation must operate upon the lungs into which it enters in this condition according to its original qualities the lungs being the chief instrument of sanguification and acting strongly upon the chyle to bring it to an animal fluid must be reacted upon as strongly    good air assists the digestion as it is an instrument of sanguification in the lungs  prop iii the chyle is not perfectly assimilated into blood by its circulation through the lungs for it is known by experiments of bloodletting that several parts of it remain unmixed with the blood swimming a top like an oily substance even eight hours after repast and no doubt this digestion as well as that through the alimentary duct is different in different subjects  prop iv after the chyle has passed through the lungs nature continues her usual mechanism to convert it into animal substances during its circulation with the blood viz by intimately mixing the parts of the aliment with these of the animal juices by the action of the solid parts  the mixture of blood and chyle after its circulation through the lungs being brought back into the left ventricle of the heart is drove again by the heart into the aorta through the whole arterial system every particle of the body receives some branch from the aorta except some of the solid parts of the liver the arteries are elastick tubes endued with a contractile force by which they squeeze and drive the blood still forward it being hindered from going backward by the valves of the heart the arteries are conical vessels with their bases toward the heart and as they pass on their diameters grow still less and less the celerity of the motion diminishes by the increase of the friction of the fluid against the sides of the tubes without this motion both the blood and the chyle would be converted into one solid mass but on the contrary by the continuance of it the fluid being compressed by the sides of the tube especially in the small vessels where the points of contact are more the blood and chyle are still more intimately mixed and by attrition or friction attenuated by which the mixture acquires a greater degree of fluidity and similarity or homogenerety of parts therefore    good blood and a due projectile motion or circulation are necessary to convert the aliment into laudible animal juices    the strength of the aliment by which i understand its resistance to the solid parts ought to be proportioned to the strength of the solid parts and as animals that use a great deal of labor or exercise have their solid parts more elastick and strong they can bear and ought to have stronger food too thin nourishment being quickly dissipated by the vigorous action of the solid parts    the defects of the first concoction are not to be mended by the second for if the chyle passes into the blood in a bad state as the force of fibers which contribute to the second digestion is limited it is not sufficient to convert a peccant liquor into laudable animal juices  prop v the aliment as it circulates through an animal body is reduced almost to an imperceptible tenuity before it can serve the animal purposes  the blood in live animals consists of red globules swimming in a serum or watery liquor the smallest vessels which carry the blood or red fluid by lateral branches separate the next thinner fluid or serum the diameters of which lateral branches are less than the diameters of the blood vessels and will not in a healthy state admit the red fluid such may be called serous arteries those serous arteries emit lateral branches which carry lymph a liquor still more limpid than serum and from the liquor which they carry may be called lymphatick arteries transmitting their liquor into the lymphatick veins those lymphatick arteries will not admit serum how far this progression goes is not certain ten capillary arteries in some parts of the body as in the brain are not equal to one hair and the smallest lymphatick vessels are a hundred times smaller than the smallest capillary artery what mechanism is that which can attenuate a fluid compounded of the ingredients of human aliment as oil salts earth water so as to make it flow freely through such tubes    hence one can easily perceive the inconveniency of viscidity which obstructs and acrimony that destroys the capillary vessels    obstructions must be most incident to such parts of the body where the circulation and the elastick force of the fibers are both smallest and those are the glands which are the extremities of arteries formed into cylindrical canals    hence too solid or viscous aliment is hurtful to scrophulous persons  prop vi the fluids and solids of an animal body demand a constant reparation  an animal in order to be moveable must be flexible and therefore is fitly made of separate and small solid parts replete with proper fluids the whole body is nothing but a system of such canals which all communicate with one another mediately or immediately for a lymphatick vessel communicates with the artery by the intermediate gland in this moveable body the fluid and solid parts must be consumed by the muscular motion and the perpetual flux of the liquids a great part of which are thrown out of the body by proper emissaries and the smaller solids are likewise rubbed off mixed with the fluids and in that form exhaled therefore both fluids and solids demand a constant reparation    the quantity of solids not morbid in an animal body is very small as appears by atrophies or decays and likewise by microscopes those solids are entirely nervous and proceed from the brain and spinal marrow which by their bulk appear sufficient to furnish all the stamina or threads of the solid parts the solids are originally formed of a fluid from a small point as appears by the gradual formation of a foetus the solids and fluids differ only in the degree of cohesion which being a little increased turns a fluid into a solid how the fluids are repaired has been already explained the nutrition of the solids is somewhat more obscure  prop vii nutrition of the solids is performed by the circulating liquid in a due degree of tenuity in the smallest vascular solids  the fluids and solids of an animal body are easily transmutable into one another the white of an egg a fluid resembling the serum of the blood and of which a whole animal is made will coagulate and turn solid by a moderate heat and the hardest of animal solids are resolvable again into gellys  as the white of an egg by incubation so can the serum by the action of the fibers be still more and more attenuated a fluid moving through a flexible canal when the canal grows extremely small and slender by its friction will naturally lengthen and as it were wiredraw the sides of the canal according to the direction of its axis and as the canal is lengthened or wiredrawn it grows still smaller and slenderer so as that the evanescent solid and fluid scarce differing the extremities of these small canals will by propulsion be carried off with the fluid continually and likewise continually repaired and new ones made in their room the force of the fluid will likewise separate the smallest particles which compose the fibers so as to leave vacant interstices in those places where they coherd before which vacant places will be again filled up by particles carried on by the succeeding fluid as a bank by the mud of the current and which of course must be reduced to that figure which gives the least resistance to the current and consequently must apply themselves to the inward surface of the canal so as to preserve the tube the system of tubes that is the animal entire    those tubes that are most recently made of fluids are most flexible and most easily lengthened such tubes as have often suffered this force grow rigid and hardly more extendible therefore    an animal the nearer to its original the more it grows    to this motion of elongation of the fibers is owing the union or conglutination of the parts of the body when they are separated by a wound    from the foregoing doctrine it is easy to explain the formation of the most solid parts of the body for when the fluid moves in several small vessels which by the contact of their sides stop the current of the fluid those canals by degrees are abolished and grow solid several of them united grow a membrane these membranes further consolidated become cartilages and cartilages bones consequently an animal the nearer it is to its original the more pipes it has and as it advances in age still the fewer many of our vessels degenerate into ligaments the very sutures of the skull are abolished in old age    many practical rules may be drawn from the foregoing doctrine for the diet of human creatures according to their different states of life and the condition of the solids it is evident that the diet of infants ought to be extremely thin such as lengthens the fibers without rupture but in a young animal when the solids are too lax the case of rickety children the diet ought to be gently astringent  the aliment likewise ought to be different according to the state of the solids in animals full grown though an animal arrives at its full growth at a certain age perhaps it never comes to its full bulk till the last period of life the membrana adiposa invests almost every part of the body so that there is hardly any fiber but is sheathed with a part of it this membrane separates an oily liquor called fat necessary for many purposes of life when the fibers are lax and the aliment too redundant great part of it is converted into this oily liquor all the superfluous weight of an animal beyond the vessels bones and muscles is nothing but fat but the conversion of the aliment into fat is not properly nutrition which is a reparation of the solids and fluids and fat properly speaking is neither but i shall treat more particularly of these subjects in their proper place    the matter of nutrition is most subtle and nutrition the last and most perfect animal action to perform it by the foregoing propositions there must be a due degree of projectile motion or celerity of circulation to which attrition and heat is proportional the heat equal to incubation is only nutritious any thing less or more is insufficient and the nutritious juice itself resembles the white of an egg in all its qualities by too weak a circulation the aliment approaches to these qualities which it would acquire by a small degree of heat without motion is viscous imperfectly mixed and the person in this condition is subject to all the accidents of a plethora by too strong a projectile motion the aliment tends to putrefaction is dissipated and the solid parts instead of being repaired are destroyed hence may be deduced the force of exercise in helping digestion and likewise the rules for regulating the times and degrees of it but those are foreign to my subject  prop viii the frequent repetition of aliment is not only necessary for repairing the fluids and solids of an animal body but likewise to keep the fluids from the putrescent alkaline state which they would acquire by constant motion and attrition without being diluted by a fresh emulsion of new chyle  an animal that starves of hunger dies feverish and delirious as appears by experiments upon cats and dogs for the most fluid parts are dissipated what remains turns alkaline and corrosive affecting the tender fibers of the brain the most severe orders of the church of rome who practice abstinence feel after it fetid hot eructations and headaches long abstinence does not kill by want of blood for twenty days fasting will not diminish its quantity so much as one great hoemorage an animal can never dye for want of blood while there is a quantity sufficient for the continuity of the pressure it makes so applied to the brain as to produce animal spirits besides the diminution both of the fluids and solids in an atrophy is much greater than what can happen by being starved therefore fasting kills by the bad state not by the insufficient quantity of fluids  any watery liquor will keep an animal from starving very long by diluting the fluids and consequently keeping them from this alkaline state which is confirmed by experience for people have lived twenty four days upon nothing vid philosoph transactions but water and the stories of long abstinence where water has been allowed are not incredible    long abstinence in hot bilious constitutions may be the parent of great diseases yet it is more troublesome to acid constitutions by the uneasiness it creates in the stomach  chap iii observations drawn from the nature and most simple analysis of vegetable substances prop i all animals are made immediately or mediately of vegetables that is by feeding on vegetables or on animals that are fed on vegetables there being no process in infinitum  prop ii vegetables are proper enough to repair animals as being near the same specific gravity with the animal juices and as consisting of the same parts with animal substances spiritwater salt oil earth all which are contained in the sap they derive from the earth which consists of rainwater air putrified juices of plants and animals and even minerals for the ashes of plants yield something which the loadstone attracts plants are either eat raw or prepared by the arts of cookery  prop iii the sap is diversified and still more and more elaborated and exalted as it circulates through the vessels of the plant  the sap when it first enters the root and is not subdued by the action of the plant retains much of its own nature and has not much of the vegetable being earthy watery poor and scarce oleaginous the sap after it has entered the root is more and more elaborated as it passes into the stem branches leaves flowers fruit and seeds the juice of the stem is like the chyle in an animal body not sufficiently concocted by circulation and is commonly subacid in all plants this juice is yielded in great plenty by incision in some plants the juices of the leaves are first that obtained by expression which is the nutritious juice rendered somewhat more oleaginous from this juice proceeds the difference of the taste of the leaves of plants secondly wax which is scraped off by the bees and is a vegetable substance thirdly manna which is an essential sacharine salt sweating from the leaves of most plants  the juices of the flowers are first the expressed juice a little more elaborated secondly a volatile oil and spirit wherein the particular smell of the plant resides thirdly honey exuding from all flowers the bitter not excepted this is gathered by the bees and sucked in by their trunks into their stomachs the juice of the fruit is still the juice of the plant more elaborated the juice of the seed is an essential oil or balm designed by nature to preserve the seed from corruption the bark contains besides the common juice an oily juice which sweats out of diverse plants when this juice is in greater plenty than can be exhaled by the sun it renders the plant ever green this oil farther inspissated by evaporation turns by degrees into balm pitch rosin etc besides all these there is a peculiar juice in each species not reduceable to water oils balsam which may be called the blood of the plant thus some plants upon breaking their vessels yield a milky juice others a yellow of peculiar tastes and qualities    hence it follows that he who eats a whole raw plant or the expressed juice of it takes in a greater variety of substances than he who feeds on the same plant prepared or on some of the parts of it for all plants have the most of the forementioned ingredients at least in small quantities    vegetables differ from fossils and animals in that being burnt to ashes they yield a fixed alkaline salt which in those of a sharp scent as mustard onions etc is in a very small quantity    the effects of vegetable substances upon human bodies are more various than these of animal substances and the mechanism of plants seems to be more various than that of animals for the same plant produces as great a variety of juices as there is in the same animal and the different plants a greater variety and yet the aliment of plants is one uniform juice for from the same soil may be produced a great variety of plants whereas different species of animals live upon very different sorts of substances both mechanisms are equally curious from one uniform juice to extract all the variety of vegetable juices or from such variety of food to make a fluid very near uniform the blood of an animal    the specific qualities of plants reside in their native spirit oil and essential salt for the water fixed salt and earth appear to be the same in all plants  the effects of the forementioned ingredients of plants are as follows vegetable salts are capable of resolving the coagulated humors of a human body and of attenuating by stimulating the solids and dissolving the fluids salts likewise promote secretions oils relax the fibers are lenient balsamic and abate acrimony in the blood it is by virtue of this oil that vegetables are nutrimental for this oil is extracted by animal digestion as an emulsion and abounds most in plants of full growth and when the salts and water are in least abundance aromatic plants though they abound with oil yet it is not soft and nutritious but as it is mixed with a spirit is too heating  the volatile salt and spirit of vegetables is penetrating heating and active contrary to the properties of acids the balsams of plants contain a volatile salt such balsams when deprived of their acids change into oils wax consists of an acid spirit of a nauseous taste and an oil or butter which appears white this oil is emollient laxative and anodyne  honey is the most elaborate production of the vegetable kind being a most exquisite vegetable soap resolvent of the bile balsamic and pectoral honey contains no inflammable spirit before it has felt the force of fermentation for the distillation of it affords nothing that will burn in the fire  the fruits of most vegetables are likewise soaps all soaps which are a mixture of salt and oil are attenuating and deobstruent resolving viscid substances for mere water dissolves nothing but salts but as the substance of coagulations is not merely saline nothing dissolves them but what penetrates and relaxes at the same time that is a soap or a mixture of oil and salt    tastes are the indexes of the different qualities of plants as well as of all sorts of aliment different tastes proceed from different mixtures of water earth oil and salt but chiefly from the oil and spirit mixed with some salt of a peculiar nature a muriatick or briny taste seems to be produced by a mixture of an acid and alkaline salt for spirit of salt and salt tartar mixed produce a salt like sea salt bitter and acrid differ only by the sharp particles of the first being involved in a greater quantity of oil than those of the last acid or sour proceeds from a salt of the same nature without a mixture of oil in austere tastes the oily parts have not disentangled themselves from the salts and earthy parts such is the taste of unripe fruits in sweet tastes the acid particles seem to be so attenuated and dissolved in the oil as to produce only a small and grateful titillation in oily tastes the salts seem to be entirely disentangled  vegetables have very different effects on human bodies as they contain acid or alkaline salts and are to be used according to the different constitution of the body at that time as will appear by what will be said afterward all the tetrapetalous siliquose plants are alkalescent  prop iv mankind take as aliment all the parts of vegetables but their properest food of the vegetable kingdom is taken from the farinaceous or mealy seeds of some culmiferous plants as oats barley wheat rice rye maes panick millet or of some of the siliquose leguminous as pease beans etc those as they are seeds by what was said prop iii contain the most elaborate part of the plant are oily and therefore proper to make the animal emulsion of chyle and their oil is not highly exalted and hot as that of acrid and aromatical plants but mild and benign to human bodies  barley is emollient moistning and expectorating oats have some of the same qualities barley was chosen by hippocrates as proper food in inflammatory distempers rice is the food of perhaps two thirds of mankind it is most kindly and benign to human constitutions proper for the consumptive and such as are subject to haemorages next to rice is wheat the bran of which is highly acescent and stimulating therefore the bread that is not too much purged from it is more wholesome for some constitutions rye is more acid laxative and less nourishing than wheat millet is diraetick deterging and useful in diseases of the kidneys panick affords a soft demulcent nourishment both for granivorous birds and mankind mays affords a very strong nourishment but more viscous than wheat pease being deprived of any aromatic parts are mild and demulcent in the highest degree but being full of aerial particles are flatulent when dissolved by digestion beans resemble them in most of their qualities all the forementioned plants are highly acescent except pease and beans  the mealy parts of the forementioned plants dissolved in water make too viscid an aliment to be constantly used and justly condemned by hippocrates therefore mankind have found the means to make them more easy of digestion by fermenting and making some of them into bread which is the lightest and properest aliment for human bodies leaven by its acid salt dividing the mucous and oily parts of the meal  the next sort of substances which mankind feed on are fruits of trees and shrubs these all contain water or phlegm a great quantity of oil much elaborated and an essential salt upon the different mixtures of these ingredients depend their different qualities by which they are sharp sweet sowr or styptick of fruits some are pulpy others contained within a hard shell which last are indeed the seeds of the plants to which they belong and contain a great deal of oil entangled with earthly parts and salts which oftentimes make them hard of digestion and pass the alimentary duct undissolvd there are other fruits which contain a great deal of cooling viscid juice combined with a nitrous salt which sometimes makes them offensive to the stomach such are many of the low pomiferous kind as cucumbers pompions though amongst those melons when good have a rich juice and somewhat aromatic they are diuretic and there are instances of their having thrown people into bloody urine  of alimentary leaves the olera or pot herbs afford an excellent nourishment amongst those are the cole or cabbage kind emollient laxative and resolvent alkalescent and therefore proper in cases of acidity red cabbage is reckoned a medicine in consumptions and spittings of blood amongst the pot herbs are some lactescent papescent plants as lettuce and endive which contain a most wholesome juice resolvent of the bile anodyne and cooling extremely useful in all diseases of the liver artichokes contain a rich nutritious stimulating juice  of the stems of plants some contain a sine aperient salt and are diaretick and saponaceous as asparagus which affects the urine with a fetid smell especially if cut when they are white and therefore have been suspected by some physicians as not friendly to the kidneys when they are older and begin to ramify they lose this quality  of alimentary roots some are pulpy and very nutritious as turnips carrots these have a fattening quality which they manifest in feeding of cattle there are other roots which contain an acrid volatile salt as onions garlic leeks radishes the mildest of these is selery those sorts of roots are alkalescent and heating and therefore proper in cases of acidity the fungus kind as mushrooms truffles afford an alkaline salt and much oil some of them being poisonous make the others suspicious if taken in too great quantities  there are many vegetable substances used by mankind as seasonings which abound with a highly exalted aromatic oil as thyme savoury and all spices those are heating and the most of them hard of digestion the most friendly to the stomach is fennel mustard which is used in seasoning abounds with a most pungent salt and oil extremely active and heating sugar is an essential salt of a plant combined with an oil which renders it inflammable  prop v to give an account of the ingredients into which vegetables resolve themselves by the most simple operations of cookery and chemistry  the operations of cookery and chemistry fall much short of the vital force of an animal body no chemist can make milk or blood of grass yet it gives some light to this subject to show into what parts vegetables resolve themselves by such simple operations as barely separate their parts without confounding or destroying them  the two operations already mentioned viz making an emulsion and vegetable putrefaction resemble animal digestion the most    in making an emulsion the oily parts of vegetables dissolve into a white liquor resembling chyle our vegetable food consists of mealy seeds fruits bread etc upon which the teeth and jaws act as the pestle and mortar the spittle bile pancreatick juice etc art the menstruum instead of the water which the chemist employs the stomach and intestines are the press and the lacteal vessels the strainers to separate the pure emulsion from its foeces the chyle is white as consisting of salt oil and water of our food much levigated or smooth this likewise constitutes the whiteness of emulsions    vegetable putrefaction by what has been mentioned before turns vegetable substances into an animal nature    amongst the ingredients of vegetables that which constitutes the most spiritous and fragrant part of the plant is what passes by perspiration and exhales by the action of the sun this is as it were the presiding spirit of the plant from which it draws its peculiar flavor and is the most active principle in the vegetable thus every plant has its atmosphere which have very various effects on these who stay near them producing head achs sleep fainting vapors and others a great refreshment of the spirits it is reported that in brazil there are trees which kill those that sit under their shade in a few hours this fragrant spirit is obtained from all plants which are in the least aromatic by a cold still with a heat not exceeding that of summer    if to a plant you pour hot water and let it stand a sufficient time the liquor strained is called the infusion of the plant if the plant be boiled in the same water the strained liquor is called the decoction of the plant the infusions and decoctions of plants contain the most separable parts of the plants and convey not only their nutritious but medicinal qualities into the blood this is plain by many experiments the infusion of cassia fistularis makes the urine green the infusions and decoctions of rhubarb and saffron will in a quarter of an hour tinge the urine with a high yellow    the most oily parts are not separated by a slight decoction till they are disentangld from the salts for if what remains of the subject after the infusion and decoction be continued to be boiled down with the addition of fresh water a fat sapid odorous viscous inflammable frothy water will constantly be found floating a top of the boiling liquor which being scummd off and gently dried will flame away in the fire this liquor is a kind of soap consisting of the oil and salt of the plant    infusions and slight decoctions contain more of the specific qualities of the plant than these which are more violent for by a strong decoction some part of the taste and smell fly off every moment    the infusion and decoction prepared as before being evaporated to a thicker consistence according to the several degrees of thickness passes into a jelly defrutum sapa rob extract which contain all the virtues of the infusion or decoction freed only from some of the watery parts    the utmost force of boiling water is not able to destroy the structure of the tenderest plant the lineaments of a white lily will remain after the strongest decoction    the extract obtained by the former operation burnt to ashes and those ashes boiled in water and filtrated yield a fiery salt   0 the greater quantity of volatile salt any plant contains which is the case of the more pungent in taste and odor the less it affords of this fixed alkali those fixed alkaline salts do not preexist in the same form in the plant for acid plants as sorel will afford by this operation an alkaline salt those salts grow still more fiery and alkaline by a greater degree of heat of all the essential salts of plants that which is in most common use in aliment is sugar which rather dissolves phlegm than increases it fot it grows tenacious only by long boiling it is a sal oleosum for it is both soluble in water and fusible in fire     another manner of preparing vegetables is by expressing their juices those expressed juices contain the true essential salt of the plant for if they be boiled into the consistence of a syrup and fet in a cool place the essential salt of the plant will shoot upon the sides of the vessels those essential salts of plants differ according to the plant unto which they belong but are reduced into three classes first those of acid astringent austere vegetables as of unripe fruits which resemble the tartar secondly those of succulent watery plants as endive cichory which afford a fine nitrous kind of salt soluble in water and very cooling thirdly those from oily aromatic and odoriferous vegetables which will hardly afford any till their oils be extracted from them feom hence it appears that the expressed juices of vegetables not filtrated very clear contain their whole specific virtues     in the preparations of cookery the most volatile parts of vegetables are destroyed if any of them are retained it is in decoctions which are made in balneo  decoctions when we take the liquor contain the specific virtues of the plants when we feed upon the plant it makes their solid parts more tender and deprives them of a great deal of their more subtle oils     the vascular and solid parts of plants are incapable of any change in the animal body for the remainder of a strong decoction held over a clear fire will burn to ashes which is true elementary earth the fibrous and solid parts of plants pass unaltered through the intestines and sometimes by sticking there occasion great disorders grains and nuts pass often through animals unaltered the excrements of horses are nothing but hay and as such combustible     vegetable substances contain a great deal of air which as they are dissolved in the alimentary duct expands itself producing all the disorders of flatulency     there are other preparations of vegetables by fermentation whereby they are wrought up into spirituous liquors which may be called by the general name of wines such fermented liquors have quite different qualities from the plant itself for no fruit taken crude has the intoxicating quality of wine  chap iv observations from the nature and most simple analysis of animal substances an animal considered in its material part cannot well be defined from any particular origanical part which in some species are wanting in others are more than one nor from its locomotive faculty for there are some which adhere to rocks and other places the characteristick of an animal is to take its aliment by a voluntary action by some aperture of the body which may be called a mouth and to convey it into another called the intestines into which its roots are implanted whereby it draws its nourishment much after the manner of vegetables only a vegetable has its root planted without itself and an animal its root within its self a foetus in the womb is indeed nourished like a plant but afterward by a root planted within itself perhaps too an animal may be distinguished from a vegetable in that its juices move through the canals by a projectile motion  prop i to give a short account of the constituent parts of animal substances  an animal consists of solid and fluid parts unless one should reckon some of an intermediate nature as fat and phlegm    the solids seem to be earth bound together with some oil for if a bone be calcined so as the least force will crumble it being immersed in oil it will grow firm again  the last animal solids are earth in its greatest simplicity for the chemists make vessels of animal substances calcined which will not vitrify in the fire for all earth which has any salt or oil in it will turn to glass    the fluids of animals are more crude and resemble those of vegetables as they are nearer the root of the animal thus chyle may be said to be a vegetable juice in the stomach and intestines and poured upon blood it seems like oil as it passes into the lacteals it grows still more animal and when it has circulated often with the blood it is entirely so    blood is the most universal juice in an animal body and from which all the rest are derived the red part of it differs from the serum the serum from the lymph the lymph from the nervous juice and that from the several other humors that are separated in the glands    animal substances differ from vegetable in two things first in that being reduced to ashes they are perfectly insipid all animal salts being volatile flying off with great heat secondly in that there is no sincere acid in any animal juice    and yet the parts of the one are transmutable into the nutritious juice of the other an animal can nourish a plant and a plant an animal by which it seems probable that vegetables have the power of converting the alkaline juices of animals into acids from the two forementioned differences of vegetable and animal substances follows first that all animal diet is alkalescent or antiacid secondly that animal substances containing no fixed salt want the assistance of those for digestion which preserve them both within and without the body from putrefaction    the constituent parts of animals are first earth secondly a peculiar spirit analogous to that of plants thirdly water fourthly salts fifthly oil    the earth as was before observed is sincere and immutable    the spirit is an oily substance so attenuated as to become volatile this spirit seems to be distinguished in every species and individual a bloodhound will follow the tract of the person he pursues and all hounds the particular game they have in chase and the faculty by which they distinguish particular men seems to be analogous to ours of distinguishing the different species of vegetables by their scent    therefore since the animals of the wild kind have their scent and consequently this presiding spirit more high it is probable that their juices are more exalted in proportion   0 water is the chief ingredient in all the animal fluids and solids for a dry bone distilled affords a great quantity of insipid water therefore water seems to be proper drink for every sort of animal     the juices of animals consist of water impregnated with salts of a peculiar nature excepting chyle which as was said before may be reputed a vegetable juice and often contain acids these salts are neither acid nor perfectly volatile for in the evaporation of human blood by a gentle fire the salt will not rise but only the spirit and water not perfectly fixed for human blood calcined yields no fixed salt nor is it a sal ammoniac for that remains immutable after repeated distillations and distillation destroys the ammoniacal quality of animal salts and turns them alkaline so that it is a salt neither quite fixed nor quite volatile nor quite acid nor quite alkaline nor quite ammoniacal but soft and benign approaching nearest to the nature of a sal ammoniac the elementary salts of animals are not the same as they appear by distillation these alterations being made by fire those salts are of a peculiar benign mild nature in healthy persons who have a vital force to subdue all the sapid substances which they feed upon but in such who have not that vital force or commit some error in their diet these salts are not sufficiently attenuated and retain their original qualities which they discover in cahexies scurvies of several kinds and other distempers the cure of which chiefly lies in the choice of aliment with qualities opposite to the nature of these salts     animal oil is various according to principles inherent in it but being freed from the earth salts etc it is a simple unactive principle and the same in all animals     animal substances are more easily assimulated into animal substances and therefore it seems probable that they are more nourishing to human bodies than vegetable  the nature of animal food must depend upon the nature age diet and other circumstances of the animal we feed upon  animal juices as well as vegetable are in their greatest perfection when the animal is full grown young animals participate of the nature of their tender aliment as sucklings of milk  animal nourishment differs considerably as the animal is terrestrial amphibious or aquatick fishes contain more of animal salts and oil for they corrupt sooner than terrestrial animals some fishes as the thornback when dried taste of sal ammoniac  the muscular fibers of fishes are generally more small and tender than those of terrestrial animals and their whole substance more watery some fishes as whitings can be almost entirely dissolved into water  from which qualities a diet of fish is more rich and alkalesccnt than that of flesh and therefore very improper for such as practice mortification the inhabitants of seaport towns are generally prolifick  the oils with which fishes abound often turn rancid and lie heavy on the stomach and effect the very sweat with a rancid smell which is found to be true in some places where the inhabitants live entirely upon fish  notwithstanding the redundant oil in fishes they do not increase fat so much as flesh by reason of their watery quality  waterfowl abound with the same rancid oil as fish  fish being highly alkalescent wants to be qualified by salt and vinegar     another difference of the flesh of animals depends upon the difference of their food from which it is not hard to determine their qualities considered as aliment those animals that live upon other animals have their flesh and juices more alkalescent than those that live upon vegetables     the difference of the qualities of the flesh of the same species depends upon the manner of living of the animal  abstracting from other considerations the most healthy animal affords the best aliment and the castrated than those that are not so  an animal that feeds itself takes the most proper food in the properest quantities if it has plenty enough has better air and more exercise all which contribute to make the animal more healthy for these reasons hippocrates commends the flesh of the wild sow above the tame the wild kinds of animals having more exercise have their juices more elaborated and exalted but for the same reason the fibers are harder especially when old for this reason perhaps the roebuck is the finest of the venison kind this rule in some measure holds true with fishes seafish living in an element more agitated and riverfish are better than those in ponds  eels for want of exercise are fat and slimy for this reason perhaps fish without fins and scales were forbid the israelites  as the fibers of fat animals are often more tender and moist than those of lean they are more coveted by mankind and tame fowls offering themselves as it were to mankind seem to be their natural food     the juices of the same animal in decoctions are often more nourishing when the solid parts are not so good and the broth made of grown animals more nourishing than that of young for of the parts of the same animal the muscular flesh with the nervous parts afford the best nourishment as containing the most spirituous parts the difference of the muscular flesh taken in substance depends upon the hardness tenderness moisture or dryness of the fibers the glands differ according to the particular juices which they separate from the blood of all the glands the livers are the most corruptible stallfed oxen and crammed fowls are often diseased in their livers  prop ii to give an account of the nature and most simple analysis of animal fluids and solids  the properest subjects for such an enquiry are first the fluid which begins to receive an animal nature without having perfectly attained to it and approaches nearest to the nature of chyle viz milk secondly that which having attained an animal nature by circulation is noxious if retained in the animal urine thirdly an animal fluid no ways excrementitious mild elaborated and nutritious and from which every part of a perfect animal can be formed the white of an egg fourthly the nutritious juice of a healthy human body which resembles the white of an egg in most of its qualities fifthly the bones    none of the animal fluids above mentioned in a sound state is either acid or alkaline first if to any quantity of warm new milk you pour oil of tartar per deliquium or any other alkali no effervescence will follow but the whole body of the liquor will remain at rest though it appear somewhat thinner to another quantity of warm milk pour spirit of nitre or any strong acid and again no motion nor ebullition will appear only the milk presently after will become thicker than it was mix together the two parcels of milk upon which the experiments were made and a great effervescence will immediately arise from whence the proposition is evident that milk is neither an acid nor alkali but when there is an acid and alkali mixed in it they manifest themselves by their conflict milk does not discover itself to be acid or alkaline by trials with the syrup of violets  the same experiments hold in two parcels of the urine of a healthy person before it has stood twelve hours  the same experiments succeed on two parcels of a white of an egg only it grows somewhat thicker upon mixing with an acid the serum of the blood stands the same trials of acids and alkalis    the milks of several animals differ but very little as to their sensible qualities womens milk is the sweetest as to their nutritious qualities they seem to stand in the following order that of women asses mares goats sheeps cows the milk of animals which make hard dung is most nourishing    milk standing some time naturally separates into an oily liquor called cream and a thinner blue and more ponderous liquor called skimmd milk neither of which parts is naturally acid or alkaline but may turn so by standing for some time nor in the least acrimonious for being let fall into the eye they cause no pain or sensation of sharpness milk is a kind of emulsion or white animal liquor resembling chyle prepared chiefly from vegetables and after it has been mixed with the animal juices of the saliva bile pancreatick juice etc is easily separated from them again in the breasts    it differs from a vegetable emulsion by coagulating into a curdy mass with acids which chyle and vegetable emulsions will not acids mixed with them precipitate a tophaceous chalky matter but not a chyly substance for as was before observed if you pour spirit of nitre into any quantity of boiling new milk and no conflict or effervescence will follow but the liquor divides itself into curd and whey which whey turns spontaneously acid and the curd will turn into cheese as hard as a stone which shows that the most solid parts of animals may be made of milk the same effect of turning milk into a hard curd may happen in a human body that abounds with acids    milk drawn from a sound animal fed on vegetables standing in a heat equal to that of a man in health will soon separate itself into a cream and a more serous and ponderous liquor which after twelve days attains to the highest degree of acidity but if the milk be drawn from some animals that feed only upon flesh that have fastd long are feverish or have undergone hard labor it will be more apt to turn rancid and putrify than turn acid acquiring first a saline taste which is a sign of putrefaction and then it will turn into an ichor    if to a quantity of boiling new milk you add by degrees any fixed alkali as salt of tartar or oil of tartar per deliquium there will be a lighter coagulum formed than by an acid the milk by boiling will change into a yellow color and run through all the intermediate degrees till it stops in an intense red the same thing happens by the alkaline powers of the body for when an animal that gives suck turns feverish that is its juices more alkaline the milk turns from its native genuine whiteness to yellow to which the suckling has an aversion this was the case as the learned boerhaave tells us of the cows of holland    if a nurse should abstain from all acid vegetables from wine maltdrink and feed only on flesh and drink water her milk instead of turning sour will turn putrid and smell like urine an alkalescent diet except that of water is often the case of nurses in great families their milk subjects the child to fevers on the other hand the milk of poor people that feed upon an acescent vegetable diet subjects the child to diseases that depend upon acidity in the bowels as cholick the symptoms of such a constitution are a sour smell in the faces sour belchings distensions of the bowels and paleness of the flesh the cure of both diseases is effected by a change of diet in the nurse from alkalescent to acescent or contrary ways as the case requires the best diet for nurses is a mixture of both  it follows likewise from the foregoing observations that no nurse should give suck after twelve hours fasting and that a tendency to yellow is an early sign of a fever in the nurse    recent urine as it is neither acid nor alkaline distilled yields a limpid water neither acid nor alkaline saline nor inflammable and what remains at the bottom of the retort is neither acid nor alkaline but being exhaled by the consistence of a syrup passes through all the degrees of colors yellow red brown and black and this soapy water being calcined affords some quantity of sea salt but only in the case of the animals taking sea salt with its food    hence sea salt passes unaltered through all the strainers of a human body the moderate use of it is very proper to preserve bodies through which it passes from corruption it detergeth the vessels and keeps the fluids from putrefaction the ancients gave the sal gemmoe in putrid fevers  all human urine distilled affords a water of a fetid odor which that of animals fed on vegetables does not the urine of hard drinkers and feverish persons affords a liquor extremely fetid but no inflammable spirit what is inflammable stays in the blood and affects the brain great drinkers commonly die apoplectick   0 the urine is a lixivium of the salts that are in a human body and the proper mark of the state and quantity of such salts and therefore very certain indications for the choice of diet may be taken from the state of urine though the salts of human urine be neither acid nor alkaline these salts may by the violent motion of the blood be turned alkaline and even corrosive and when they begin to turn so they affect the small and tender fibers of the brain more sensibly than other parts     recent urine distilled with a great heat and dry sand will afford a volatile alkaline salt and after the same manner the heat of a human body as it grows more intense makes the urine smell still more strong and of a deeper color but as long as those alkaline salts are carried off by urine the brain and nerves are less affected but on the contrary when in a fever these salts are left behind that is when the urine turns pale the patient is in danger     recent urine distilled with a fixed alkali is turned into an alkaline nature whence it seems probable that alkaline salts taken into a human body have the power of turning its benign salts into fiery and volatile on which account they seem improper in inflammatory distempers where the salts are already too much attenuated hippocrates who found out this by experience ordered in such a case things of an acid nature in general a high colored urine indicates an acid cooling diet for it is certain an acid or alkalescent diet makes a great difference in the salts of a human body     the rob or sapa of urine distilled with quick lime affords a siery but not an alkaline spirit and lime water given inwardly in the case of a diabetes will bring the urine from limpid pale to be of a higher color which shows the power of a lixivium of quick lime to unlock the salts that are entangled in the viscid juices of some scorbutic persons     recent urine will likewise crystalize by inspissation and afford a salt neither acid nor alkaline but of an active nature which may be properly called the essential salt of a human body urine becomes alkaline by digestion in a heat not greater than that of a human body and throws off a stony matter to the sides of the vessel     the urine long detained in the bladder as well as a glass will grow red fetid cadaverous and alkaline the case is the same with the stagnant water of hydropical persons which at last produce a drought and feverish heat     from hence very good rules may be drawn for the diet of nephritick and dropsical persons that it ought to be such as is opposite to and subdueth the alkalescent nature of the salts in the serum of their blood those manifest themselves in the urine which as was said before is the lixivium of the whole body sal ammoniac may likewise be obtained from urine which is nearest to the nature of an animal salt     the white of an egg resembles the nutritious juice of an animal body from the white of an egg every part of a perfect animal is formed for during the incubation of the hen there is nothing of the egg consumed but the white     the white of an egg is a viscous unactive insipid inodorous liquor capable of mixing with water and so mild that appplyd to the most sensible part the eye it causes no pain     it is neither acid nor alkaline for if the juices of an animal body were either so as by the mixture of the opposites to cause an ebullition they would burst the vessels   0 the white of an egg gradually dissolves by heat exceeding a little the heat of a human body a greater degree of heat will thicken it into a white opaque dry viscous mass and this is the case of the serum of the blood upon which different degrees of heat produce contrary effects  attention ought to be had to this maxim in the management of diet exercise and all outward and inward application to human bodies and warm cataplasms discuss but scalding hot may confirm the tumor heat in general does not resolve and attenuate the juices of a human body for too great heat will produce concretions     spirit of wine mixed cold with the white of an egg coagulates it as much as boiled water which shows that spirit of wine is an immediate styptick so that injected into the veins it is sudden death and taken by the mouth in great quantities is sometimes sudden but always certain death spirituous liquors are so far from attenuating volatilizing and rendering perspirable the animal fluids that it rather condenseth them and hardneth the solids and therefore properly used to hinder the growth of young animals and this it will do by mere external friction thereby coagulating the juices in the extremities of the vessels hardening and abolishing the canals and so increasing their resistance against the force of the influent liquid which would otherwise stretch them this plainly demonstrates the bad effects of inflammable spirits on human bodies     the water gained from the white of an egg by a gentle distillation is neither acid nor alkaline but by a strong distillation it affords an alkaline spirit salt two kinds of oil and an earth which is another instance of the alterations great degrees of heat cause in animal subjects and hence we may conclude that volatile salts never exist in their own form in an animal body that the heat required to make them volatile endangers the life of the animal hence a highly alkascent diet in hot constitutions must be hurtful     the white of an egg will putrify and turn alkaline by digestion a single grain of this putrified substance has operated like a poison causing vomiting and a looseness the antidote of this poison is some acid liquor and such are indeed indicated when the juices of a human body verge to putrefaction the white of an egg during incubation is dissolved but not properly speaking putrified for in such a state it would be unfit for nutrition     it seems probable that the bile in a human body by stagnating putrifies causing a cholera morbus in the first passages and a pestilential distemper when it mixeth with the blood in such a state of the bile the aliment ought to be thin to dilute demulcent to temper or acid to subdue and destroy an alkaline acrimony  the nutritious juice of a healthy animal resembles the white of an egg in most of its qualities but this nutritious juice being a subtle liquor scarce obtainable from a human body the serum of the blood is fairly substituted in its place     the serum of the blood stands the forementioned trials and discovers itself to be neither acid nor alkaline only oil of vitriol thickens and the oil of tartar thins it a little     the serum of the blood digested in a heat not greater than that of a human body in health will gradually become thinner begin to smell cadaverous and putrify and at last like the white of an egg turn to an alkaline ichor that ferments with acids and committed to distillation affords like the white of an egg an alkaline salt this shows the effect of gentle heat in dissolving coagulations for even the viscous matter which lies like leather upon the extravasated blood of pleuritick people may be dissolved by a due degree of heat     when the blood stagnates in any part of the body it first coagulates then resolves turns alkaline putrid and corrosive     as the serum of the blood is resolvable by a small heat a greater heat coagulates it so as to turn it horny like parchment but when it is thoroughly putrified it will no longer concrete the blood of some persons who have died of the plague could not be made to concrete by reason of the putrefaction already begun     the serum of blood coagulates like the white of an egg with cold spirit of wine   0 the serum of the blood is more saline than the white of an egg perhaps by the salts taken in nourishment and has something of a more fetid urinous scent     the serum of the blood affords by distillation an exceeding limpid water neither acid nor alkaline which shows that the most subtle part of the blood approaches nearer to water than any other liquor and that the blood naturally contains no volatile salt     these experiments are to be made on the blood of healthy animals it is possible in a lax and weak habit of body where the chyle is not thoroughly assimilated by circulation but floats on the blood like oil that such a serum might afford quite other contents and perhaps even an inflammable spirit by reason of the vegetable nature of the chyle     the serum of the blood by a strong distillation affords a spirit or volatile alkaline salt and two kinds of oil and an earth which still proves the effect of heat in human bodies in changing the benign salts into alkaline     the serum of the blood is attenuated by circulation so as to pass into the minutest channels of an animal body and become fit nutriment for it but by the continual attrition and heat of some of its particles becomes sharp and offensive to the body nature has provided the kidneys to discharge them hence appears as by prop viii chap ii the continual necessity of a fresh recruit of chyle which like an emulsion dilutes the serum the mischiefs arising from the retention of salts that ought to pass by urine and likewise the proper indications for cooling and diluting in such an alkalescent state of the fluids     it appears by experiments made upon bones and other animal solids that they consist of the same principles with the fluids a dry bone distilled affords a great quantity of insipid water after the bones have undergone the violence of the fire the ashes afford no fixed salt only sometimes in animals that take sea salt there will be a very small proportion of that in the ashes     the animal fluids and solids are resolvable into the same principles and this is true not only of the fluids and solids themselves but likewise of all preparations of them the gellies made of the decoction of lean flesh and bones in clear water are resolvable into the same principles as the flesh and bones themselves and if these decoctions be repeated till the water comes off clear the remainder yields no salt by distillation and little oil therefore it is possible to extract the whole virtues of animal substances by decoctions but the gentlest extract the most volatile and finest parts after the oil or fat is separated     preparations by cookery of fish or flesh ought to be made with regard to rectifying their most noxious and slimy substances and to retain those that are most nutritious such preparations as retain the oil or fat are most heavy to the stomach which makes baked meat hard of digestion     by experiments of the mixture of different substances with the serum of the blood it appears that all volatile alkalis thin it and acids coagulate it i said volatile alkalis for the serum being mixed with an equal quantity of oil of tartar per deliquium will grow somewhat thicker and an alkaline vapor arises from the mixture but the fame proportion of spirit of sal ammoniac makes the serum thinner without causing any alteration in the scent or color     spirit of vitriol poured to pure unmixed serum coagulates it as if it had been boiled spirit of sea salt makes a perfect coagulation of the serum likewise but with some different phenomena from the former the spirit of nitre produces the same effect  the serum which is mixed with an alkali being poured to that which is mixed with an acid raises an effervescence at the cessation of which the salts of which the acid was composed will be regenerated   0 vinegar is an acid of a very peculiar nature cooling and yet not coagulating for spirit of vinegar gently dilutes the serum of the blood and even the oil of tartar being poured to this mixture causes no effervescence though honiberg says that spirit of vinegar concentrated and reduced to its greatest strength will coagulate the serum     the mixture of the solutions of sea salt sal gemmae borax nitre and sal ammoniac cause no change of color in the serum but dissolve its texture a little all except that of the borax glaubers salt makes a strong coagulation of the serum by reason of the oil of vitriol it contains     all saponaceous substances which are a mixture of oil and alkaline salt thin the blood without causing any effervescence spirit of hartshorn given in great quantities will produce hemorrhages which i have known by experience and therefore is very improper in many cases boerhaave in his chemistry says that sal volatile oleosum will coagulate the serum on account of the alcahol or rectified spirit it contains     the tincture of salt of tartar viz a preparation of the highest rectified spirit of wine and the strongest fixed alkali preserves the serum in a neutral state for the spirit of wine tends to coagulate and the alkali on the contrary to dissolve it whence it becomes neither thicker nor thinner     what we take in common aliment is endued with the above mentioned qualities in some degree therefore from these experiments very useful indications for diet may be taken according to the different state of the blood as will appear by what follows  chap v of the effects of different alimentary substances upon the fluids and solids of a human body prop i different sorts of aliments are not subdued or assimilated by the vital force of a human body so entirely as to be divested of their original qualities but while they repair the fluids and solids act variously upon them according to their different natures therefore    the proper way of treating the subject of aliment is to consider the actions of the several sorts of it upon the fluids and solids of human bodies and to separate at least in idea their alimentary from their medicinal qualities  prop ii the diseases of human bodies often require substances of more active principles than what are found in common aliment in order to produce sudden alterations but where such alterations are not necessary the same effect may be obtained by the repeated force of diet with more safety to the body where the less sudden changes are less dangerous the smaller activity of aliment is compensated by its quantity for according to the laws of motion if the bulk and activity of aliment and medicines are in reciprocal proportion the effect will be the same    all bodies which by the animal faculties can be changed into the fluids and solids of our bodies are called aliment but to take it in the largest sense by aliment i understand every thing which a human creature takes in common diet as meat drink and seasoning as salt spice vinegar etc    it has been explained prop vii chap ii how the aliment in moving through the capillary tubes at last as it were stagnates and unites itself to the vessel or tube through which it flows but in this motion it will act differently both upon the fluid and solid according to its different nature every thing that acts upon the fluids must at the same time act upon the solids and contrariwise yet one may separate these two actions in idea  prop iii to enumerate the different actions upon the fluids and solids of a human body  there is a multitude of words to express the various alterations which are produced in a human body by diet and medicines but as far as relates to our present subject they may be reduced to the following general heads    the actions upon the solids are first stimulating or increasing their vibrations or oscillatory motions secondly contracting that is diminishing their length and increasing their thickness thirdly relaxing or making them more flexible in their less coherent parts and lastly constipating or shutting up the cavity of the capillary tubes    the actions upon the fluids are either changing their qualities or their quantity    their qualities are changed by first attenuating and condensing that is diminishing or increasing the bulk of their particles secondly by rendering them acrimonious or mild thirdly by coagulating and diluting that is making their parts more or less coherent fourthly by increasing or diminishing their motion through the vessels    the quantity of the fluids is increased or diminished by the increase or diminution of the quantity of aliment or by the suppressing or promoting animal secretions    that all these actions can be performed by aliment as well as medicines is plain from reason experience and in some cases by ocular demonstration by observing the effects of different substances upon the fluids and solids of a human body when the vessels are open and gape by a wound or sore the effects of tepid water and farmaceous substances in relaxing of spirits in stopping hemorrages and consolidating the fibers the power of alkaline absorbents in subduing acrimony and of oil in stopping perspiration is well known to surgeons who are likewise well acquainted with the influence of diet upon the wounds and sores of their patients and from the condition of the one can guess at the errors or regularity of the other acrid substances will break the vessels and produce an ichor instead of laudable pus the chief intention of surgery as well as medicine is keeping a just equilibrium between the influent fluids and vascular solids when the vessels are too lax and dont sufficiently resist the influx of the liquid it begets a fungus or proud flesh when the balance is on the other side it produces a cicatrice were it not criminal to try experiments upon patients which they too often try upon themselves i could answer that the doctrine of this chapter would be verified by experience in wounds and sores as it is often perceptible even in an issue  prop iv to explain the effects of different alimentary substances upon the fluids and solids of a human body    the first sort of alimentary substances are such as are of so mild a nature that they act with small force upon the solids and as the action and reaction are equal the smallest degree of force in the solids digests and assimilates them of such sort is milk and broths made of the muscular parts of animals which are as it were already prepared and easily converted into animal substances these are proper nourishment for weak bodies and agree perfectly well with them unless there be some particular acrimony in the stomach which sometimes makes them offensive and which custom at last will overcome    those things which stimulate the solids produce the greatest alterations in an animal body this is seen in many instances violent sneezing produces convulsions in all the muscles of respiration and an universal secretion of all the humors tears spittle sweat urine etc so great an alteration can be produced only by the tickling of a feather and if the action of sneezing should be continued by some very acrid substance it will at last produce headache vomiting universal convulsions fever and death therefore such active substances as taken inwardly in small quantities make great alterations in the fluids must produce this effect by their stimulating quality    acrid substances which are small enough to pass into the capillary tubes must stimulate the small fibers and irritate them into greater contraction and stronger vibrations    many things which we take as aliment or with our aliment have this quality in some degree as the juices of acid vegetables fermented liquors especially sharp wines fermented spirits aromatical vegetables as fennel savory thyme garlic onions leeks mustard which abound with a volatile pungent salt all spices in general all vegetables which being corrupted easily resolve themselves into a fetid oily alkali onions garlic pepper salt and vinegar taken in great quantities by their stimulus excite a momentary heat and fever and therefore in some cases to be mentioned afterward are very proper    the solid parts may be contracted various ways first by dissolving their continuity for when a fiber is cut through it contracts itself at both ends therefore all things which are so acrimonious as to destroy the small fibers must contract them secondly whatever makes a depletion of the vessels gives room to the fibers to contract therefore abstinence produces this effect in the best manner whatever shortens the fibers by insinuating itself into their parts as water in a rope contracts fermented spirits possess their quality in a great degree    the more oily any spirit is the more pernicious because it is harder to be eluted by the blood brandy is more easy to be so than spirit of juniper and that than spirit of aniseseed compound aromatical spirits destroy first by their fermentative heat secondly by their oily tenacity thirdly by a caustic quality residing in spices apt to destroy the solid parts but these qualities render them proper in some cases taken in small quantities    fermented spirits contract harden and consolidate many fibers together abolishing many canals especially where the fibers are the tenderest as in the brain by which quality they destroy the memory and intellectual faculties    acid austere vegetables have this faculty of contracting and strengthening the fibers without some of the bad effects of fermented spirits as all kinds of sorrel the virtues of which lie in an acid astringent salt a sovereign antidote against the putrescent bilious alkali several kinds of fruits as quinces some sorts of pears with the marmalades made of them medlars capers barberries pomegranates purslain such are easily distinguished by a rough styptick taste amongst drinks austere wines unripe fruits likewise have the same quality but are apt to obstruct the nerves and occasion palsies    relaxing the fibers is making them flexible or easy to be lengthened without rupture which is done only in the capillary vascular solids amongst liquids endued with this quality of relaxing warm water stands first next watery decoctions of farinaceous vegetables or grains as oats barley etc all sweet and mild gardenfruits almost all potherbs spinach betes cabbage coleworts and all that tribe red cabbage besides is reckoned a good pectoral some of the lactescent and papescent plants as lettuce cichory whose milk is anodyne and resolvent therefore good in diseases of the liver but all such vegetables must be unfermented for fermentation changes their nature oils expressed from mild plants animal oils cream butter marrow which last is of all oily substances the most penetrating   0 it is not probable that any thing which human creatures take as aliment should have the quality of entirely constipating or shutting up the capillary vessels because such substances could hardly enter the lacteals and if they did would stop the circulation in the lungs but all viscid aliment such as is made of farinaceous substances unsermented neither pass the lacteals nor circulate so easily as the same substances fermented some of the fungus kind gathered by mistake for edible mushrooms have produced a difficulty of breathing     the qualities of the fluids can be likewise changed by diet as first by attenuating or diminishing the cohesion of the parts of the fluid the cohesion of the parts depends upon the weight and quantity therefore abstinence and a slender diet attenuates because depletion of the vessels gives room to the fluid to expand itself     whatever penetrates and dilutes at the same time therefore water impregnated with some penetrating salt attenuates most strongly water with sal ammoniac will pass through a human skin to this quality may be justly ascribed the great effects of medicated waters all stimulating substances by increasing the motion of the blood attenuate unless they increase the motion so much as at last to produce coagulation     thickening the blood is most easily brought about by exhaling the most liquid parts by sudorisick or watery evaporations but this brings it into a morbid state acid austere vegetables before mentioned have this quality of condensing the fluids as well as strengthening the solids     the blood of laboring people is more dense and heavy than of those who live a sedentary life and the diseases which people imagine proceed from the thickness of blood come often from the contrary cause too thin blood strays into the immediately subordinate vessels which are destined to carry humors secreted from the blood according to what was said prop v chap ii this causes an obstruction falsely ascribed to the thickness of the blood  the qualities of blood in a healthy state are to be florid when let out of the vessel the red part congealing strongly and soon together in a mass moderately tenaceousswimming in the serum which ought to be without any very yellow or greenish cast the gravity of blood to seawater is as    is to    that of the serum to the same water as  00 to     it is an easy matter to examine extravasated blood by these marks     acrimony is not natural but induced into the fluids of an animal body acrimony may be introduced by diet that is either muriatick briny or acid which likewise is of two sorts of things naturally acid or made so by fermentation aromatic consisting of salts and highly exalted oils intimately united or secondly by increasing the velocity of the blood and consequently the attrition of the parts     acrimony in the blood it self is commonly of three sorts according to the nature of the salts in which it resides acid alkaline or muriatick as in the sea scurvy but the last approaches more toward the alkaline and admits of the same cure acid acrimony resides chiefly in the first passages proceeding often from the weakness of digestion and the too long duration of vegetables and milk in the stomach animal substanccs are all alkalescent of vegetable substances some are acid others alkalescent and each sort is to be used according to the two different intentions     antiacid vegetables are first all kinds of garlic onions leeks and selery the actiscorbutick plants carrots turnips eringo roots asparagus horseradish mustard cabbage secondly all animal substances especially of such as live on other animals the juices of which are more alkalescent than of the animals which live upon vegetables such are most fishes especially some of the testaceous kind thirdly water as it dilutes and subdues acidity fourthly oils are antiacids so far as they blunt acrimony but as some times they are hard of digestion they produce acrimony of another sort     on the other hand when the acrimony is alkaline which is more frequently the case in the circulating juices the proper diet is decoctions of farinaceous vegetables which seem appointed by nature for the vegetable diet of human creatures this alkaline acrimony indicates the copious use of vinegar and acid fruits as oranges which contain a juice most effectual in the cure of the muriatick scurvy of mariners the juice of lemons is likewise more proper and more cooling and astringent than that of oranges in this case all the mild antiscorbuticks are indicated as sorrel cichory lettuce apples and of liquids whey on the contrary all the acrid antiscorbuticks as scurvygrass horseradishes mustard etc are hurtful in this hot scurvy     there is a third sort of antiscorbuticks proper in this alkalescent state of the fluids which is called astringent such as pomegranates capers and most of the common pickles prepared with vinegar the extremity of alkali is putrefaction all acid substances and sea salt resist putrefaction but as it is a sharp solid body unalterable in an animal body when it is taken in too great quantities in a constant diet of salt meat it breaks the vessels produces erosions of the solid parts and all the symptoms of the seascurvy which is to be cured by acid vegetables and not by hot antiscorbutick all spices likewise induce this acrimony as was hinted before   0 there are other substances which are opposite to both sorts of acrimony which are called demulcent or mild because they blunt or sheath these sharp salts as farinaceous legumes such as pease beans lentils native oils of animals as cream butter marrow which last is a specific in that scurvy which occasions a crackling of the bones in which case marrow performs its natural function of moistening them all plants which are without smell or pungent taste are demulcent as likewise all the alimentary parts of sound animals for none of their juices will hurt the eye or a fresh wound acrimony which is not viscid may be cured by diet but viscidity requires more active substances to dissolve it     whatever renders the motion of the blood more languid than natural disposes to an acid acrimony what accelerates the motion of the blood beyond what is natural disposes to an alkaline acrimony     the next alteration which is made in the fluids is rendering it more thin which is performed by diluting there is no real diluent but water every fluid is diluent as it contains water in it water dilutes but at the same time relaxeth this last quality is taken off by mixing some acid juice with it water mixed with acids resists the heat and alkalescent state of the fluids as long as there is thirst a quick pulse dryness with a free passage by urine and stricture of the vessels so long is water safely taken     opposite to dilution is coagulation or thickening which is performed by dissipating the most liquid parts by heat or by insinuating some substances which make the parts of the fluid cohere more strongly all vegetables which make a black tincture with the vitriol of steel have this quality they have commonly a rough styptick taste vinegar as was said before is an acid very particular for it does not coagulate inflammable spirits coagulate the fluids and harden the solids in a strong degree     resolving what is congealed is turning it into a fluid again this can be performed by watery liquors impregnated with some penetrating salt but more effectually by sapanaceous substances composed of oil and salt such are honey and the robs and gellies of most fruits vinegar and honey mixed is a strong resolvent spissitude is subdued by acrid things and acrimony by inspissitating     the second manner of operating upon the fluids is by increasing or diminishing their quantity the first is performed by a plentiful diet and the suppression of evacuations the second either by a spare diet or promoting the animal secretions that is expelling the fluids out of the body though secretions of the laudable juices are best accomplished by increasing the fluids     whatever generates a quantity of good chyle must likewise generate milk such is new milk seasoned with sugar or salt this will increase the milk when it is diminished by the too great use of flesh meat gruels made of grains broths malt drink not much hoppd posset drinks and in general whatever relaxeth have the same effect     there are as many good pectorals of the alimentary as of the medicinal kind as all preparations of barley oats honey all saponaceous substances beforementioned which attenuate phlegm     there is aliment lenitive expelling the faeces without stimulating the bowels such are anim al oils quite fresh for by standing they grow acrid as cream butter marrow broths made of the parts of animals about the mesentery oils expressed from ripe fruits from unripe they are austere and astringent the juices of mild and ripe fruits decoctions of farinaceous vegetables natural soaps as honey sugar such diet is proper for the hot constitutions of warm countries where strong perspiration exhales the moisture water milk whey taken in the open air without much exercise so as to make them perspire relax the belly     there are aliments which besides this lubricating quality stimulate in a small degree gellies made of the solid parts of animals as of their horns stimulate by the salts that are in them salted flesh which often throws shipscrews into fluxes shell fishes which have a saline taste garden fruits which have any acrimony most sorts of berries some of which will produce diarrhoeas warm water mixed with honey and honey mixed with acids dissolve phlegm in the bowels there are others which promote the secretion of bile such as all natural soaps the juices of fruits sharp and sweet especially grapes the immoderate use of which will produce a cholera morbus   0 diuretics are decoctions emulsions and oils of emollient vegetables in so far as they relax the urinary passages such as relax ought to be tried before such as force and stimulate those emollients ought to be taken in open air to hinder them from perspiring and on empty stomachs vegetables which abound with essential salt are diuretic by stimulating as sorrel chervil parsley eringo etc and likewise all such as contain an aromatical balsam as asparagus fennel etc     as to sudorificks it ought to be considered that the liquid which goes off by sweat is often the most subtle part of the blood and ought not to be forced away without manifect necessity the matter of insensible perspiration is mild that of sweat resembles urine and yields a volatile salt oily and fetid when sweat is vehement it will grow bloody the matter of sweat is the watery part of our drink impregnated with this salt sometimes in weak and consumptive people crude chyle and sometimes as was said before the most elaborate subtle part of our blood as in fat people who have a small insensible perspiration     sweat is produced by changing the balance between the fluids and solids in which it must be confessed that true health consists so as the projectile motion of the fluids overcome the resistance of the solids therefore it is produced by relaxing the passages of the skin secondly by diluting thirdly by dissolving the blood fourthly by accelerating its motion water dilutes and relaxes at the same time therefore the best and safest sudorifick watery and acid things mixed prove strong sudorificks spices by heating and dissolving the blood are not so proper and safe sudorificks     insensible perspiration is the last and mod perfect action of animal digestion the keeping it up in due measure is the cause as well as sign of health and the least deviation from that due quantity the certain forerunner of a disease therefore the best indications for diet are taken from the measure of perspiration  the food which is most vaporish and perspirable is certainly the most easily digested but such may be proper or improper for the animal according to its circumstances especially the quantity of its muscular motion by prop iv chap ii the strength of the aliment must be proportioned to the action of the solids upon it which in an animal under a course of exercise or hard labor is much stronger therefore aliment too vaporose or perspirable will subject it to the inconveniences of too strong a perspiration which are debility faintings and sometimes sudden death what diminishes sweating or the sensible perspiration increases the insensible for that reason a strengthening and astringent diet often conduces to this purpose according to the experiments of sanctorius the most nourishing aliment is the least perspirable except mutton which of all others is most so and hogs flesh the least and for the same reason eels and all very fat and oily substances copious food of small nourishment perspires much  a stomach too void or too full stops perspiration the fruits of the low pomiferous plants as cucumbers melons etc stop perspiration therefore they are wisely provided by nature in a season when the perspiration is too great variety of meats diminish perspiration honey in cold constitutions increases perspiration except when it promotes too great a secretion of the bile and then it diminishes it drinking excessively during the time of chylification stops perspiration let those who sit long at their bottle after meals consider this  the most sure sign of a deficient perspiration is flatulency or wind     the menses are promoted first by every thing which occasions a plethora such are all aliments of easy digestion taken in sufficient quantity secondly by all saponaceous substances which incide the mucus in the first passages thirdly by spices and warm vegetables which abound with a volatile oily salt of these we have spoken before     heat in animal bodies is produced by the attrition of the fluids and solids for when that cease as in death there is extremity of cold the solid parts of animals rubbing against one another would in time produce a heat capable to destroy the parts had not nature provided an oily substance to lubricate and moisten them when that fails as happens sometimes in the scurvy gout and rheumatism an inflammatory heat is often produced     stimulating substances taken in diet increase heat because they increase the oscillatory motion of the solids but most of all inflammatory spirits whatever increases the density of the blood even without increasing its celerity heats because a denser body is hotter than a rarer extreme cold at last heats cold in animal bodies is produced by causes contrary to those productive of heat as first by diminishing the force of any stimulus as by whey milk water etc secondly by all things which relax thirdly alkaline substances in respect of acid and acid in respect of alkaline are cooling     cephalic are all such things as attenuate the blood so as to make it circulate easily through the capillary vessels of the brain a cordial properly speaking is not always what increases the force of the heart for by increasing that the animal may be weakened as in inflammatory diseases whatever increases the natural or animal strength the force of moving the fluids and the muscles is a cordial such are such substances as bring the serum of the blood into the properest condition for circulation and nutrition as broths made of animal substances milk ripe fruits and whatever is endued with a wholesome but not pungent taste whatever relaxes the too strict or strengthens the too lax fibers what in some cases dispels wind what excites and takes off the sluggish motion of the animal spirits as spices wine and spirituous liquors     carminative are such things as dilute and relax at the same time because wind occasions a spasm or convulsion in some part whatever promotes insensible perspiration is carminative for wind is perspirable matter retained in the body     all emollient relaxing diet and all things which destroy acrimony abate pain   0 there are several things taken in diet which kill worms as oil and honey  whoever attends to the particulars barely hinted at in this chapter will easily perceive that all the intentions pursued by medicines may be obtained and enforced by diet  it may be expected that i should say something in this chapter of the qualities of three exotic plants whose infusions and decoctions are now much used in common aliment tea coffee and chocolate there are many treatises wrote about them which ascribe to them both good and bad qualities which they have not there is lately published a very learned and elaborate dissertation upon tea by doctor thomas short in which the author with great knowledge industry and skill has not only given us the natural history of the plant but likewise its analysis  but as the infusions and decoctions of the forementioned vegetables in common water are the only preparations of them in use there is no necessity in this place of considering any of their contents but such as are extracted by those simple operations of cookery  the green leaves of tea contain a narcotick juice which exudes by roasting this is performed with great care before it is exposed to sale the several methods of discovering the adulterations of tea by copperas galls spirit of hartshorn one may see in the forementioned treatise tea by its manner of affecting the organs of taste and smell contains very little of a volatile spirit its rosin or fixed oil which is bitter and astringent cannot be extracted by water but demands rectified spirit the active principles of it extracted by infusion are the most separable parts of its oil or gum and its salt  its salt and gum are astringent chalybeat water draws from it a tincture of the same color as that from oakleaves it is acescent as appears by its effects upon stomachs troubled with acidity so that tea is an infusion of a plant acescent and moderately astringent in warm water  as a watery liquor it is diluting and stimulating by its salt by its astringent quality it moderates the relaxing quality of warm water by what has been said before in this chapter water endud with any saline stimulating substance is very penetrating and goes into the most inward recesses of the circulating juices by its quality and refreshes the brain and animal spirits but by its styptick and stimulating quality it affects the nerves very often occasioning tremors by its heat it promotes perspiration by its watery quality it dissolves what is viscid in the stomach and so ay help digestion but a strong decoction of it is emetick and drinking too great quantities may relax and weaken the tone of the stomach  as stimulating and diluting it is diuretic but as it is astringent it is not quite so proper where relaxing the urinary passages is necessary  milk abates some of the forementioned qualities making it more soft and nutritious and sugar as a salt increases its stimulus from those hints it follows first that tea is proper only for such whose bodies are in such a state as demands some of the forementioned alterations who these are will be shown more plainly in the following chapter secondly that the immoderate strength and quantity of this liquor may be hurtful in many cases and to most people  coffee has in common with all nuts an oil strongly combined and entangled with earthy particles  the most noxious part of its oil exhales in roasting to the abatement of near    of its weight  vid philos transact one pound of coffee by distillations afforded of volatile spirit six ounces six drachms of oil two ounces two drachms two scruples of caput mortuum five ounces three drachms though the chemist did not or could not calcine the caput mortuum so as to obtain its fixed salt to be sure it must have some  what is extracted by water from coffee is the most separable parts of oil which often swims atop of the decoction this oil is volatile and consequently very little nutritious  volatile oils refresh the animal spirits but likewise are endued with all the bad qualities of such substances producing all the effects of an oily and aromatical acrimony mentioned in the following chapter as dryness heat stimulation tremors of the nerves from whence it has been accused of causing palsies leanness watchfulness and destroying masculine vigor  from these qualities it is easy to imagine that it must be hurtful to hot dry bilious constitutions and perhaps beneficial to phlegmatic and that drank in too great a degree of strength or quantity hurtful to every body  chocolate is certainly much the best of those three exotic liquors its oil seems to be both rich alimentary and anodyne for an oil as soft as that of sweet almonds can be extracted from the nut and the indians made bread of it this oil combined with its own salt and sugar makes it saponaceous and detergent by which quality it often helps digestion and excites appetite when it is mixed with vanillios or spices it acquires likewise the good and bad qualities of aromatic oils which are proper in some cases and constitutions and very improper in others  chap vi of the different intentions to be pursued in the choice of aliment in different constitutions wholesome and unwholesome are relative not real qualities therefore to affirm that such a thing is wholesome or unwholesome without describing the subject in all its circumstances to which it bears these relations is with submission talking nonsense  to make these terms of wholesome and unwholesome aliment intelligible there are two things necessary first to show what aliment is proper for what intention secondly what intention is proper to be pursued in such a constitution of a human body the first is the subject of the foregoing chapter and the second of this  prop i to enumerate the most common diversities of the constitutions of human bodies  the most common diversities of human constitutions arise either from the solid parts as to their different degrees of strength and tension in some being too lax and weak in others too elastick and strong or from the different state of the fluids which as they consist of spirit water salts oil and terrestrial parts differ according to the redundance of the whole or of any of these ingredients and therefore are plethorick phlegmatic oily or fat saline earthy or dry by the dissipation of the most fluid parts which last constitution is called by the ancients atrabilarian or melancholic a plethorick constitution in which true blood abounds is called sanguineous a saline constitution is either acid alkaline or muriatick according to the difference of the salts which occasion it    in some of these senses though every human constitution is morbid yet are their diseases consistent with the common functions of life and leave them under their own conduct as to their manner of living and therefore are a proper subject for this discourse in which i am far from pretending to instruct the brethren of the profession or anticipating their directions to such as are under their government    i think it proper to advertise the reader of two things first that i endeavor to give the most simple idea of the distemper of the constitution and the proper diet abstracting from the complications of the first or the contraindications to the second secondly that in a discourse of this nature the reasonings must be precise though the practice may admit of great latitude  prop ii to explain the causes symptoms and proper diet of such as have weak and lax fibers    in all the fibers of an animal body and in the sides of all the canals there is a contractile power whereby the fibers endeavor to shorten themselves this is evident for if a fiber be cut transversly both the ends shrink and make the wound gape the force opposed to this contractile power of the fibers is the influent liquid health consists in the equilibrium between those two powers when the fluids move so equally that they dont press upon the solids with a greater force than they can bear and no more in one part than in another and on the other hand when the solids resist and act upon the fluids so equally that there is no uneasy sensation the animal is in health on the contrary when ever this equilibrium between the influent fluids and solids is taken away the animal is in a morbid state and whatever destroys it in any point destroys it in some measure through the whole body    the first and most simple solids of our body are perhaps merely terrestrial incapable of any change or disease of these elements are constituted the smallest fibers of those fibers the vessels of those vessels the viscera or organs of the body therefore the weakness and laxity of the fibers vessels viscera and all parts of the body may be considered as one disease though it must be owned that the disease is not always universal and there will be sometimes a weakness in some organ with a great degree of muscular strength    a fiber is said to be weak when the cohesion of its parts is so small that it may be broken or resolved by a force not much greater than what happens commonly in the body of a healthy person debility of the vessels or organs is so small a cohesion of the constituent parts as makes them unable to discharge the common functions of life considered in a state of health though there is a debility of fibers in infants absolutely speaking yet it is no disease because their fibers being lax lengthen by the influx of the liquids which is the cause of their growth but in adult persons when the fibers cannot any more yield they must either break or lose their spring    laxity of a fiber is such a small cohesion of its parts as suffers it to be lengthened by a small force laxity is a species of debility    the most common causes of debility of fibers are first a defect or great loss of the vital nutritious juices if there is not blood enough the chyle cannot be easily assimilated a person who loses daily great quantities of blood turns dropsical and leucophlegmatick an elastick fiber like a bow the more it is extended restores itself with the greater force if the spring be destroyed it is like a bag only passive as to the influx of the liquid secondly nourishment too viscid and glutinous to be subdued by the vital force of this sort hippocrates reckoned unfermented bread thirdly a sedentary life for motion increases the circulation of the juices and consequently the application of the solid parts to one another fourthly too great an extention of the fibers by plenitude a lutestring will bear a hundred weight without rupture but at the same time cannot exert its elasticity take away fifty and immediately it raises the weight fifthly a moist atmosphere the atmosphere is what keeps the fibers of an animal body together we feel our fibers grow strict or lax according to the state of the air many who live healthy in a dry air fall into all the diseases that depend upon relaxation in a moist one lastly a natural weakness from the frame and constitution of the body    the common signs and effects of weak fibers are paleness smoothness coldness of the skin color of the blood not florid for what makes that is a strong action of the solids a weak pulse tumefactions in the whole body or parts stagnation of humors and its consequence putrefactions for when the force of the vessels and pressure of the air is taken off all the humors expand themselves and what stagnates must putrify if a person of a firm constitution begins to bloat and from being warm grows cold his fibers grow weak anxiety and palpitations of the heart are a sign of weak fibers acid eructations upon taking vegetable food or nidorose upon taking animal is a sign of weak organs of digestion depravation of the humors from a sound state to what the physicians call by the general name of a cacochymy spots and discolorations of the skin are signs of weak fibers for the lateral vessels which lie out of the road of circulation let gross humors pass which could not if the vessels had their due degree of stricture atrophy as denoting a destruction or obstruction of the vessels which carry the nourishment and dropsies proceed from a laxity of the fibers being too weak to return the fluid    it is evident that the aliment of persons with weak fibers ought to be such as requires but a small force to convert it into animal substances such is that mentioned chap v prop iv v milk is the chylous part of an animal already prepared the cheesy part is separated and dissolved by the bile and the more serous and spiritous part enters into the blood mere whey is too relaxing eggs taken warm from the hen for the most elaborate and spiritous part is lost in the dressing broths made of flesh which are the nutritious animal juices separated from the solid parts the alkalescent quality of them may be corrected if necessary by mixing them with some acid decoctions and creams or jellies of well fermented bread for fermentation as was hinted chap iii prop iv destroys the glutinous oily viscidity with which mealy substances abound austere wines diluted with water which cool more than water alone and at the same time do not relax vegetables with an acid austere juice mentioned chap v prop iv viii are all proper in this case relaxation from plenitude is cured by spare diet and from any cause by that which is contrary to it care must be taken in contracting the fibers not to obstruct the vessels  prop iii to explain the symptoms causes and proper diet of such as have too strong and too elastick fibers    a state opposite to the former is too great rigidity and elasticity of the fibers which is such a degree of cohesion as makes them inflexible to the causes to which they ought to yield so as to preserve the animal in health too great elasticity is that quality by which they not only resist against elongation but restore themselves with too great pressure and force upon the moving fluid  rigidity of the organs is such a state as makes them resist that expansion which is necessary to carry on the vital functions rigidity of the vessels and organs must necessarily follow from rigidity of the fibers both as the fibers are their constituent parts and likewise because by the strong force of the heart and motion of the fluids many of the solids are compacted into one and the canals through which they flowed abolished as by prop vii chap ii    true health consists in such a flexibility of fibers as yield to the force of the heart so as to admit the influent fluid and then such a due spring to restore themselves so as to drive it forward for if the canals were entirely rigid or the force of the fibers in restoring themselves were either in equilibrium with or exceeding that of the heart there could be no circulation even if the vessels drive back the blood with too great a force upon the heart it will produce polypose concretions in the ventricles of the heart especially when the valves of the heart are apt themselves to grow too rigid if but one drop of blood remain in the heart at every pulse those in many pulses will grow to a considerable mass    it is easy by the laws of hydraulicks to determine the natural effects of such a constitution which is the parent of acute diseases as laxity of chronical    the cause of such a disease besides the natural constitution and frame of the body is too long a continuance of such diet as strengthens the fibers hard exercise or labor such as use it according to hippocrates are not easily cured of pleurisies such a constitution is easily known by the outward appearances of the body being lean warm hairy scraggy dry without a disease with hard and firm muscles for the great force by which the small vessels restore themselves makes them grow narrow expelling the liquor they contain and scarce admitting what is influent by which the vessels grow hard and contracted lastly by the strength of the pulse and the force of the vital actions    the rules of diet for such a constitution may be drawn from prop iv of the foregoing chapter first abstinence from things used in the contrary state of too great laxity milk is too nourishing but whey proper as an emollient austere and strong wines are improper but much more so are inflammable spirits which harden the fibers water is the proper drink being strongly relaxing there is no better way of suppling a carcass then by drenching it in water all emollient nourishment such as fruits which contain a mucilage and may be boiled into jellies pot herbs of the emollient kind such things as resolve and cleanse that is take away any tenacious solid which adheres to the fibers such are vegetable soaps the chief of which is honey the animal food should be prepared in broths rather than in any other form all things which increase fat all oily substances the animal oils cream butter marrow farinaceous substances unfermented as little salt in the aliment as possible for salt hardens    from those two causes of the laxity and rigidity of the fibers the methodists an ancient set of physicians derived all diseases of human bodies with a great deal of reason for the fluids derive their qualities from the solids there seems hardly any other account to be given of the different animal secretions than the different configuration and action of the solid parts which from one homogeneous liquor separate so many various fluids in an animal body and i am of opinion that in most cases where the juices are in a morbid state if one could suppose all the unsound juices taken away and sound juices immediately transfused the quality of the solid parts remaining the same after many circulations the sound juices would grow morbid the methodists erred in so far as they considered the disease inhering only in the vascular solids and applied their remedies chiefly to them not reflecting that the solids themselves can be changed by working upon the fluids  prop iv to explain the causes and proper diet of plethorick constitutions  the diseases of the fluids are first a plethora or too great abundance of laudable juices the causes of which are strong chylopoetick organs plenty of wholesome diet a middle age sanguineous temperament of which afterward laziness or want of muscular motion moist air suppression of usual evacuations the effects are impatience of heat or labor extension of the greater vessels compression of the lesser lacerations upon small causes a stoppage of circulation by too great a weight upon the heart suffocation etc the remedies for this constitution are opposite to the causes of it spare diet exercise and proper evacutions only it must be observed that plethorick bodies are not to be cured by long abstinence because in that case the most liquid parts fly off and the grosser remain bloodletting removes a symptom but often increases the force of the chylopoetick organs and consequently the disease  prop v to explain the symptoms and proper diet of sanguineous constitutions    a sanguineous constitution in the common acceptance of the word that is of a person who abounds with blood is different from a plethorick the common outward sign of such a constitution is a florid appearance in the countenance a blueness and fullness of the veins softness of the flesh a particular vivid fair but not pale color of the skin such a constitution with a great appearance of health is subject to many diseases    the blood as was observed prop v chap ii consists of red globules swimming in a thin liquor called serum the red part is smallest in quantity the red globules are elastick and will break one red globule into six small and then they will turn yellow those yellow globules break into others still smaller and then they grow more white and transparent the vessels which admit the smaller globules cannot admit the greater without a disease therefore as the blood passes through narrower channels the redness disappears more and more all the chyle is white and acquires this red color by circulation a free and strong projectile motion of the blood must occasion a florid appearance upon the skin in such constitutions because a stronger motion forces the red part into more capillary vessels to which likewise there is commonly another cause that concurs the greater transparency of the vessels occasioned by the thinness and delicacy of their coats that this is the case of sanguineous persons is plain from their great veins appearing blue and transparent by the color of the blood in them    therefore such persons seem to be susceptible of diseases that depend upon a strong projectile motion of the blood and too great thinness and delicacy of the vessels by the first they are subject to inflammatory distempers for the greater action or reaction of the fluids and solids produces a greater attrition to which heat is proportional this great attrition must produce a great propensity to the putrescent alkaline condition of the fluids and consequently to suppuration a stronger projectile motion of the blood must likewise occasion greater secretions and loss of liquid parts and from thence perhaps spissitude and coreaceous concretions which are always found in animals that die of too strong a circulation  if the vessels are in a state of too great rigidity so as not to yield a strong projectile motion occasions their rupture and haemorragies especially in the lungs where the blood is abundant if the vessels instead of breaking yield it subjects the person to all the inconveniences of an erroneous circulation that is when the blood strays into the vessels destined to carry serum or lymph according to prop v chap ii from whence will follow obstructions and inflammations and as the thinness and delicacy of the vessels probably reigns through the whole system it must affect the glands and lymphatick as well as the blood vessels and such constitutions must be subject to glandulous tumors and ruptures of the lymphatick and all the diseases thereon dependent    the natural helps from diet are first moderation in the quantity and all things which relax the veins for what does so prevents too vigorous a motion through the arteries therefore relaxing and cooling are proper intentions in the diet only where there are signs of too great a thinness in the fluids subacid substances are proper though they are a little astringent for persons who take a great deal of vinegar abate their florid color which is the disease of such a constitution  for such a diet the reader is referred to the foregoing chapter  a saline constitution of the fluids is either acid alkaline or muriatick as in the seascurvy of these in their turns  prop vi to explain the symptoms causes and proper diet of acid constitutions    it has been demonstrated bfore that the juices of a sound animal are neither acid nor alkaline by the experiments mentioned chapter iv all the substances fluid and solid of an animal fed even with acescent substances yield by fire nothing but alkaline salts those experiments which endeavor to show the contrary have been made upon animals which had taken much sea salt which is never totally changed in an animal body the ingenious and learned boerhaave fed a sparrow with bread four days in which time it eat more than its own weight and yet there was no acid found in its body or excrements the reason of this is that the vital force of a sound animal is capable to transmute the acid substances it takes in aliment into soft nutritious animal liquids by its vital force by which is understood the sum of all those powers in an animal body which converts its aliment into fluids of its own nature a cow fed with trefoil daisies sorrel gives milk in which there is not the least acidity but if this vital force is weak it is insufficient to subdue the acidity of the substances taken by the mouth the liquors which are made of fermented plants as wine and malt liquors standing in a heat not greater than that of a human body turn sour and so they will in a human body that has not sufficient vital force to change them which makes no more alteration in such substances than a vessel with the same degree of heat and moisture thus weak stomachs vomit up the wine that they drink in too great quantities to be digested in me form of vinegar put bread into the stomach of a dying man and it will follow its own nature and undergo the alteration that is merely the effect of heat a weak stomach will turn ryebread into vinegar and a ploughman will digest it mealy substances fermented turn sour and unfermented being mixed with a small quantity of water they turn viscid and then hard like stones accordingly given to a weak child they still retain their nature for bread will give him the cholick and unfermented farinaceous substances will fill his belly with a viscous humor    as no acid is naturally in an animal body but must be taken in by the mouth so if it is not subdued in the passages of the chyle it may get into the blood and if there is not a sufficient quantity of blood and strength of circulation to subdue it it may infect the whole mass of the fluids but this is a morbid state the experiments made upon chyle have never discovered any acidity in it but the subject of these experiments has been always the chyle of healthy animals    the first and principal seat of acidity is the stomach this quality of the chyle is in some measure taken off in the duodenum and by the mixture of bile with it grows less in the other parts of the alimentary duct and still less in the thoracick duct because great quantities of animal liquors have been mixed with it but at last it may as was said before infect the blood thus it is found by experience that the sweat is sometimes acid which is a sign of recovery after acute distempers where the blood was in the contrary alkalescent disposition    the antecedent concomitants and effects of such a constitution are acids taken in too great quantities sour eructations a craving appetite especially of terrestrial and absorbent substances the case of girls in the green sickness sourness in the stomach pain in the stomach which though sometimes occasioned by an acrid bile this cause may be distinguished by the absence of other symptoms colical pains about the navel the west india dry gripes are perhaps occasioned by the too great quantities of acids as limejuice in punch the colicks of infants proceed from acidity and the air in the aliment expanding itself while the aliment ferments for oil of vitriol will throw the stomach into involuntary contractions inactivity and change of color in the bile for acids change the color and consistence of it bile is the chief instrument of digestion and as was said before prop v chap i can attenuate the cheesy substance in the stomach of a calf and render it fluid hence bilious constitutions easily digest cheese a sour smell of the faeces when the bile is redundant they smell cadaverous acid sweats paleness of the skin for as was observed before taking much vinegar will make the lips pale it is possible that tumors in the breasts may be the effect of acidity in the milk and convulsions in infants may be occasioned from acidity passing into the blood and affecting the tender fibers of the brain some sorts of cutaneous eruptions are occasioned by feeding much on acid unripe fruits and farinaceous substances    acidity as it is not the natural state of the animal fluids but induced by aliment is to be cured by aliment with the contrary qualities for which the reader is referred to the foregoing chapter antiacid medicines are ineffectual without a diet of the same kind all animal diet is alkalescent especially of such as feed upon other animals as infects fish and especially shellfish acidity in the infant may be cured by a fleshdiet in the nurse there are a great many antiacid vegetables which do not easily ferment but putrify as all the warm antiscorbuticks selery asparagus cabbage turnips carrots onions leeks radishes mustard eringoroots and nettles are antiacid in cases of acidity water is the proper drink its quality of relaxing too much may be corrected by boiling it with some animal substances as ivory hartshorn abstinence from fermented liquors is necessary    this distemper is most incident to children because of the debility of their fibers and milkdiet to such as lead a sedentary life to those who take much bread and wine and vegetable acids to girls disposed to the green sickness and to artificers who deal in the preparations of acids as distillers dyers  prop vii to explain the symptoms causes and proper diet of constitutions which abound with a spontaneous alkali    a constitution opposite to the former is that which abounds with a spontaneous alkali no animal unputrifyd being burnt yields any alkaline salt but putrified yields a volatile alkali therefore in a healthy animal no true alkali is found but as an animal degenerates from this state by such diseases as increase the attrition and heat of the fluids the animal salts formerly benign approach toward an alkaline nature human blood when it is first let is mild and will not make the eye or a fresh wound smart let it stand in a degree of heat equal to that of a human body it will grow in three days fetid the salt of it volatile and alkaline fermenting with acids the oil that remains volatile and rancid the blood in the vessels may at last arrive at the same state but must pass through infinite degrees and before it comes to the last the animal will be destroyed all animal substances exposed to the air turn alkaline of their own accord and some vegetables by heat will not turn acid but alkaline every plant in that state of putrefaction by prop iii chap i is converted as it were into an animal substance by chemical trials yielding the same contents    the causes of such a distemper is a diet of alkalescent substances if a woman should live upon vegetables bread and fermented liquors her milk would be acescent or ready to turn sour if only on animal food her milk would be apt to turn fetid and putrid but not sour  if it was possible to take mustard in great quantities it would quickly bring the blood into this alkaline state and destroy the animal the warm antiscorbutical plants taken in quantities will occasion stinking breath and corrupt the blood all animals that live upon other animals have their juices more alkalescent than such as live upon vegetables and for that reason perhaps fishes have this quality more than terrestrial animals for in the open air they putrify sooner by what was said prop i chap iv an animal with a strong vital force of digestion will turn acids into animal substances but if its food be entirely alkalescent its juices will be more so no person is able to support a diet of flesh and water without acids as salt vinegar and bread without falling into a putrid fever if his diet consisted of snails fish especially their livers shellfish vipers ravenous birds as some who feed upon insects and alkalescent vegetables the effect would happen sooner eggs and spanish wines taken in great quantities without exercise will occasion a fever abundance of good blood and laudable juices disposes toward this alkalescent state likewise long abstinence by which the fluids are deprived of a dilution of the cooling emulsion of fresh chyle see prop viii chap ii great strength of the bowels and a right state and abundance of bile bile is an antiacid another cause is a vigorous action of the vessels through which the juices circulate which is the reason strong healthy and young people are more in peril by pestilential fevers than the weak and old  violent animal motion produces this alkaline state two hard bones rubbed hard against one another or with a file produce a fetid smell it is possible to produce a gangrene by strong friction and yet stagnation of the fluids turns them putrid  the effects of such an alkalescent state in any great degree are thirst and a dejection of appetite which putrid things occasion more than any other those who are troubled with acidity have often a bad digestion but a craving appetite nidorose eructations which are different from acid foulness of the tongue and palate a bitter and hot taste in the mouth thirst sickness loathing bilious vomitings and dejections of a cadaverous smell iliacal pains with heat these are the effects of it in the alimentary diet such a state dissolves the blood and disposes it toward putrefaction hinders nutrition for no chicken can be hatched of a rotten egg the blood turning acrimonious corrodes the vessels producing hemorrhages pustules red leadcolourd black and gangrenous and almost all diseases of the inflammatory kind    the aliment of such persons ought to be acescent substances as bread vinegar such as are described in the foregoing chapter acids keep animal substances from putrefaction for neither blood flesh or fat will putrify in vinegar or sour wine the effect of the strongest acids even oil of vitriol in putrid fevers is known by experience in which your alkaline spirits must be hurtful farinaceous things especially such as are made of oats are proper as having an acescent quality it is a common mistake that people in such a state should forbear wine thin wines as rhenish moselle mixed with water are proper in a fever but when the distemper is attended with great heat milk mixed with water is the properest drink the properest seasoning is saltpeter sea salt creates thirst water is the only diluent but as it has no acidity in it it is better mixed with limon or with the rob or jelly of some acid fruit sometimes the demulcent aliment mentioned prop iv of the foregoing chapter will be of great use  the muriatick scurvy induced commonly by too great quantity of sea salt and common among mariners is rather an artificial than a natural disease spontaneous only in few who have a great disposition toward it its common symptoms are a saline taste in the spittle itching and red erosions of the skin great thirst dryness of the skin a lixivial urine sometimes with a fatty substance like a thin skin atop relief from watery and acid substances the cure of this distemper lies in a diet of fresh unsalted things watery liquors acidulated farinaceous emollient substances sour milk butter milk acid fruits and avoiding of the hot antiscorbuticks of the mustard kind the rule of diet is not much different from that in the alkaline scurvy before mentioned    it is of great importance to know whether cutaneous distempers proceed from an acid or alkaline cause because according to the difference of the cause there must be quite opposite methods of cure they may be distinguished first by the difference of the diet that occasioned them crude aliment farinaceous substances unripe fruits and other acescents will sometimes produce the scurvy and itch and even leprosies depending on the same cause in which volatile salts and such as are taken from animal substances are indicated secondly from the absence of the concomitant symptoms of the one and the other in the acid acrimony there is not thirst heat nor so great a dejection of appetite as in the alkaline thirdly the erosions of the skin are not of so deep a color in the acid as alkaline in general an attention to the symptoms before enumerated may be a guide to the diet    another constitution of the fluids of a human body may be properly called glutinous or phlegmatic phlegm amongst the ancients signified a cold viscous humor contrary to the etymology of the word which comes from  to burn but amongst them there were two sorts of phlegm cold and hot a cold tumor they called simply phlegmonem when it came from glutinous blood they called it phlegmonem phlegmenodem    phlegm or pituite is a sort of semifluid it being so far solid that one part draws along several other parts adhering to it which does not happen in a perfect fluid and yet no part will draw the whole mass as happens in a perfect solid    the pituite or mucus secernd in the nose mouth palate stomach intestines and windpipe is not an excrementitious but a laudable humor necessary for defending those parts from which it is secernd from excoriations as happens in the nose when the pituite is too thin the want of it in the windpipe occasions hoarseness in the gullet and difficulty of swallowing the pituite defends the intestines from the acrimony of the ingesta and lubricates the extremities of the joints therefore those are mistaken who imagine that phlegm cannot be too much purged off but when the phlegm is either too viscous or separates in too great a quantity it brings the body into a morbid state this viscous phlegm seems to be the vitrious pituite of the ancients    the first seat of it is the alimentary duct where it creates crudity dejection of appetite a sense of repletion and sickness for it hinders the natural contraction of the fibers and that sense of irritation which produces hunger a sensation of fullness without eating is a sure sign of a phlegmatic stomach in the intestines it occasions a tumor of the belly with an atrophy in the rest of the body for the viscous crust stops the entry of the chyle into the lacteals the case of rickety children in the body it often affects the lungs phlegm may be so concocted in the lungs by the evaporation of its most liquid parts as to shut up the passages of the bronchea and it makes paleness in the skin for as it was observed before our aliment in the form of chyle before it circulates with the blood is whitish by the force of circulation it runs through all the intermediate colors till it settles in an intense red as much as the force of circulation is deficient so much will the blood fall short of that florid color and persons in that condition are called leucophlegmatick from this phlegm proceed white cold tumors viscidity and consequently immeability of the juices hence lethargies in old people   0 the causes of this phlegmatic constitution are first viscid aliment as of unripe fruits farinaceous substances unfermented and taken in great quantities the flowers of grains mixed with water will make a sort of glue meals have an oil in them which makes their parts adhere secondly great loss or want of blood which is a natural soap preserving itself and the aliment from coagulation by constant motion thirdly weakness and indigestion in the alimentary duct which leaves the aliment viscous fourthly a defect or bad constitution of the bile which is the chief resolvent of the aliment phlegmatic and bilious constitutions are opposite fifthly dissipation of the most fluid parts by heat or some great evacuation therefore profuse sweats and fluxes of urine dispose toward this constitution by thickening the phlegm sixthly stagnation from the debility of instruments of excretion for if the pituite stagnates it must grow viscid from heat these are the causes and symptoms of a phlegmatic cold constitution but spissitude attended with heat grows inflammatory     the symptoms point to the cure all the methods of attenuating mentioned chap v prop iv well fermented bread and well fermented liquors fermentation destroys the viscidity of farinaceous substances high seasoned aliment is proper for phlegmaticks spices onions garlic dissolve viscidity water impregnated with some stimulating substance which both dilutes and attenuates hot mineral waters are the best dissolvers of phlegm all sorts of nourishment which promote heat and a vigorous motion of the blood and for that reason broths made of the most volatile and alkalescent parts of animals     a disease opposite to this spissitude is too great fluidity the symptoms of which are excess of animal secretions as of perspiration swear urine liquid dejectures leanness weakness and thirst the methods in such a case must be opposite to the former farinaceous substances and watery liquors unfermented gellies of animal and vegetable substances all such things as are described prop iv chap v     another constitution is the oily or fat animal fat is a sort of amphibious substance it is scissile like a solid resolvable by heat not greater than what is incident to human bodies circumscribed and contained in proper vessels like a fluid the symptoms of this constitution are too manifest to want a description it coincides often with the plethorick and phlegmatic constitutions above described it is but one species of corpulency for there may be bulk without fat from the great quantity of muscular flesh the case of robust people an animal in the course of hard labor seems to be nothing but vessels bones and muscular flesh let the same animal continue long in rest it will perhaps double in weight and bulk this superaddition is nothing but fat or oil and in this sense an animal perhaps never arrives at its full growth     the common causes of this distemper are a particular and perhaps a gentilitious disposition of body which seems to consist in the chylopoetick or organs of the first digestion being strong and the fibers of the circulating vessels especially those about the panniculus carnosus being lax according to the doctrine of the second chapter by the action of the fibers of the vessels upon the fluids the oily parts of the chyle are intimately mixed with the blood which by prop iii chap ii will swim a top of it several hours after repast when this action is not strong enough and the chyle extremely copious perhaps the thicker oil is never entirely subdued some sorts of crammed fowl have always a milky juice swimming atop of their blood secondly quantities of oily nourishment milk butter and oily fermented liquors thirdly all things which occasion coldness in the skin so as to stop perspiration by which the oily parts are congealed which heat resolves and attenuates the inhabitants of cold moist countries are generally more fat than those of warm and dry but the most common cause is too great a quantity of food and too small a quantity of motion in plain english gluttony and laziness i am of opinion that spare diet and labor will keep constitutions where this disposition is the strongest from being fat you may see in an army forty thousand footsoldiers without a fat man amongst them and i dare affirm that by plenty and rest twenty of the forty shall grow fat     the oil in animals is necessary for many purposes in all for motion in some for nourishment such accumulate fat in the summer which serves to refresh the blood in the penury of aliment during the winter and for that purpose some animals have a quadruple omentum but the too great abundance of fat subjects human constitutions to the following inconveniences     first it hinders the motion of the joints by making them more heavy by filling the spaces occupyd by the muscles when they contract and swell secondly it subjects them to all the diseases depending upon a defective projectile motion of the blood for the blood flows through the vessels by the excess of the force of the heart above the incumbent pressure which in fat people is excessive and as want of a due quantity of motion of the fluids increases fat the disease is the cause of itself thirdly to suppurations of which the membrana adiposa is the chief seat fourthly to danger in inflammatory distempers a fever resolves many things which stagnate and amongst others the fat which being mixed with the blood turns volatile and occasions an acrimony much more dangerous than the saline for salts can be diluted with water which oils cannot that the fat is dissolved by fevers is evident from the great loss of fat which people undergo in fevers amongst those and many other bad effects of this oily constitution there is one advantage that such of them who arrive to an advanced age are not subject to the stricture and hardness of fibers the effect of old age     the causes above mentioned lead directly to the cure as it is the product of gluttony and laziness exercise and abstinence is the antidote it has been observed that a feverish heat resolves fat and therefore what produces this effect in a small degree so as not to endanger the life of the patient must be proper such are all acrid and stimulating substances salt pepper garlic onions vinegar etc taken in quantities will produce a momentary fever salt taken in great quantities will reduce an animal body to the great extremity of aridity or dryness the ancients were so sensible of the force of stimulating in this case that the celebrated remedy against fat was a certain quantity of the vinegar of squills taken every morning for the same reason saponaceous substances as sugar honey the juices of ripe fruits pot herbs with abstinence from fat meat and even an entire milkdiet by its thinness are very effectual unfermented watery liquors are hurtful only as they relax but on the other hand quantities of oily fermented liquors commonly increase the disease all things which promote the animal secretions especially sweat and insensible perspiration and for that purpose even water taken in quantities is sometimes useful salts mixed with fat harden it and acid things congeal oil spirit of nitre will turn oil of olives into a sort of fatty substance but acids may be used as stimulating if acid things were used only as coolers they would not be so proper in this case in which it is necessary to keep up a considerable degree of heat but for their forementioned qualities they are strongly indicated in the inflammatory distempers of fat people where the oil disposes to a rancid putrefaction but abstinence being the chief dietetick method of preventing or curing the disease leads me to say somewhat of the quantity of aliment in general     by prop viii chap ii the frequent repetition of aliment is necessary not only for repairing the fluids and solids but to keep the fluids from the putrescent alkaline state which they acquire by constant attrition without being diluted from whence it follows first that long abstinence may be the parent of great diseases especially in hot bilious constitutions and extremely painful to acid constitutions by the uneasy sensation it creates in the stomach secondly that the quantity of aliment necessary to keep the animal in a due state of vigor ought to be divided into meals at proper intervals in the natural day by which method neither the chylopoetick organs nor the blood vessels are overcharged nor the juices deprived too long of fresh recruits of chyle sanctorius confirms this maxim in his doctrine of perspiration     the great secret of health is keeping the fluids in due proportion to the capacity and strength of the channels through which they pass but the danger is less when the quantity of the fluid is too small than when it is too great for a smaller quantity of fluid will pass where a larger cannot but not contrariwise   0 when the quantity of the fluid is too small the elastick power of the canal in which life consists exerts itself with too great a strength upon the fluid in which case there must follow too great a dissipation of the fluid dryness and a gradual decay in too great repletion either the elastick force of the tube is totally destroyed or if it continue proportional to the degree of extension like a bow too strongly drawn it throws the fluid with too great a projectile force forward through the vessels and back upon the heart and subjects the animal to all the diseases depending upon a plethory and may bring it into immediate danger therefore the diseases depending upon repletion are more acute and dangerous than those that depend upon the contrary state the instances of longevity are chiefly amongst the abstemious abstinence in extremity will prove a mortal disease but the experiments of it are very rare     such as have an imperfect circulation through any organ of the body should never charge their vessels with too great a quantity of chyle this was observed prop ii chap ii of the lungs and is equally true in any other case as in headaches which eating little relieves and eating and drinking much occasion a sensation of drousiness oppression heaviness and lassitude are signs of a too plentiful meal especially in young people     the measure of insensible perspiration discovered by weighing is the best rule of diet therefore in fat people the use of vaporose or perspirable food and exercise both which increase perspiration are proper     the constitution of the air disposes the inhabitants of one country more to be fat than that of another sanctoriuss experiment of perspiration being to the other secretions as   to   does not hold in this country except in the hottest time of summer so that the action of paduan air in promoting perspiration the whole year round is equal to ours in the month of august     from the foregoing doctrine a common case both of fat and lean men having great stomachs may be accounted for by the last having a great perspiration and some of the perspirable matter in the first not sufficiently attenuated stopping at the surface of the skin and as it were carried about him hunger is only a warning of the vessels being in such a state of vacuity as to require a fresh supply of aliment after secretions the vessels of the fat and lean man are equally empty for the fat is as much out of the thread of circulation as what is evaporated and perhaps the fat in that case becomes like a morbid excrescence requiring a superfluous nutrition     infants and old people support abstinence worst the first from the quantity of aliment consumed in accretion the last from their weakness and the small quantity of aliment taken at once the middleaged support it the best because of the oily parts abounding in the blood     from the foregoing principles follow naturally the hippocratical rules of diet in fevers of giving more or less more thick or more thin aliment according to the foreseen time of the duration of the fever for example in an ephemera none because of its termination in one day in a fever of four days duration less than in one of eight and as the fever comes to its height still subtracting from the quantity of aliment and making it more diluent and thin     we come now to what we may call the earthy or atrabilarian constitution where the spirituous and most fluid parts of the blood are dissipated that is the spirit water and subtle oil so much evaporated as to leave the salts earth and grosser oil in too great a proportion the blood grows darkish and thick such a constitution the ancients called atrabilarian or melancholic melancholy signifying in greek black gall whether there be any such humor as black gall is only a dispute about words hippocrates gave such an humor this name and that is sufficient besides it is matter of fact that in the extremity of this disease the gall itself will turn of a blackish color and the blood verge toward a pitchy consistence     the signs of a tendency to such a state are darkness or lividity of the countenance dryness of the skin leanness a penetrating quick genius a slow pulse and respiration the causes of it are all such as expel the most volatile parts of the blood and fix the residue great applications of the mind to one object either such as produce sadness or great joy both which equally dissipate the spirits and immoderate exercise in hot air with unquenchd thirst aliments of hard digestion as dried and salted flesh unripe fruits farinaceous substances unfermented and likewise immoderate use of spirituous liquors  the effects of such a vapid and viscous constitution of blood are stagnation obstructions acrimony putrefactions viscidity and imperfect secretion of the gall a defective circulation especially in the lateral branches destined to separate the more fluid parts and therefore viscous and sparing secretions in the glands the blood moving too slowly through the celiack and mesenterick arteries produce various complaints in the lower bowels and hypochondres from whence such persons are called hypochondriack such as sensation of weight anxiety and repletion a bad digestion from whence different kinds of aliment acquire such a state as they affect of their own nature acescent if the diet is of acid vegetables and alkaline or nidorose if of animal substances especially fat which remains rancid so as the spittle will sometimes flame in the fire this indigestion proceeds from the inactivity of the gall which likewise occasions a constipation of the belly and a difficulty of being purged the urine is sometimes limpid sometimes thick which latter is often a sign of recovery the obstruction of the pituite in the lower belly forces it upon the salivary glands and produces spitting     such a state of the fluids at last affects the tender capillary vessels of the brain by the viscidity and immeability of the matter impacted in them and disorders the imagination and at last produces corruption in the bowels of the lower belly   0 it is plain that the removal of such a disease is not to be attempted by active remedies any more than a thorn in the flesh or pitchy matter adhering to a thread of silk is to be taken away by violence what is viscid ought to be gently attenuated diluted and carried off that all substances which do heat will still dissipate the fluid parts more and consequently increase the disease therefore water impregnated with some penetrating salt is found to have great effects in this distemper the diet ought to be opposite to the particular acrimony whether acid or alkaline which it is easy to guess at by no   of this proposition it ought to be demulcent in both cases light and of easy digestion moistening and resolvent of the bile of such nature are vegetable soaps as honey and the juices of ripe fruits some of the cooling lactescent papescent plants as cichory letuce dandelion which are found effectual in hot countries the diet proper for all the intentions in this case the reader may see in the foregoing chapter  prop viii to draw a few general inferences from the foregoing doctrine  from the doctrine of this short essay it is as easy to determine the rules of diet in the different natural states as in the different morbid states of a human body    by prop vii chap ii infancy and childhood demand thin copious nourishing aliment such as lengthens their fibers without breaking or hardening because of their weakness and state of accretion milk has all those qualities    by prop iv chap ii the solidity quantity and strength of the aliment is to be proportioned to the labor or quantity of muscular motion which in youth is greater than any other age upon which account a strong and solid diet would seem to be indicated but as that age is still in a state of accretion their diet ought still to be emollient and relaxing copious and without acrimony    the diet of a human creature full grown and in the state of manhood ought to be solid with a sufficient degree of tenacity without acrimony their chief drink water cold because in such a state it has its own natural spirit and air which heat destroys with a quantity of fermented liquors proportioned to their natural constitutions    the course of the fluids through the vascular solids and the common animal functions without any violence must in length of time harden the fibers abolish many of the canals and make the solids grow together from whence dryness weakness immobility debility of the vital force both of the first and second digestion loss of teeth depravation of mastication the condition of old age which therefore demands a diet resembling that of childhood often repeated but not so copious in proportion to the bulk emollient and diluting    from the doctrine of the fifth chapter it is likewise easy to determine the inconveniences arising from the excess of any one sort of diet too much sea salt produces thirst hoarseness acrimony in the serum which destroys its soft nutritious quality erosion of the small fibers pains and all the symptoms of the muriatick scurvy    acids taken in too great quantities especially such as are austere as unripe fruits produce too great a stricture of the fibers incrassate and coagulate the fluids from whence pains rheumatism and gout paleness itch and other eruptions of the skin substances extremely stiptick are hurtful to the nerves and occasion palsies    spices in too great quantities occasion thirst dryness and heat quicken the pulse and accelerate the motion of the blood dissipate the fluids from whence leanness pains in the stomach loathings and fevers    strong liquors especially inflammable spirits taken in great quantities intoxicate constringe harden dry and stimulate the fibers and coagulate the fluids they corrode and destroy the inward coat of the stomach and intestines and if digestion be a putrefaction spirits must by their natural quality hinder that vid chiseltons anatomy they produce debility flatulency obstructions especially in the liver fevers leucophlegmacy and dropsies as by their stimulating they raise the spirits for a moment to which succeeds a proportional depression they create a habit and necessity of continuing the same course and increasing the quantity liquors in the act of fermentation as must and new ale are apt to produce spasms in the stomach cholick and diarrhaeas    a diet of viscid aliment creates flatulency and crudities in the stomach obstructions in the small vessels of the intestines in the mouths of the lacteals and glands tumors and hardness of the belly coldness paleness of the skin and viscidity in the fluids   0 a diet of oily nourishment relaxeth the solids and particularly the stomach and the intestines monks who take a great deal of oil are subject to intestinal hernias it creates nidorose eructations loathings oily and bitter vomitings obstructs the capillary vessels by hindering the entrance of the watery and fluid part with which it will not mix it creates thirst and inflammations     a constant adherence to one sort of diet may have bad effects on any constitution nature has provided a great variety of nourishment for human creatures and furnished us with appetites to desire and organs to digest them there is a most curious bill of fair in sir hans sloans natural history of jamaica as aliments have different qualities a constant adherence to one sort may make the constitution verge to some of the extremes mentioned in this chapter for healthy people celsuss rule i chap i is a good one sanus homo qui been valet and suae spontis est nullis obligare se legibus debet nullum cibi genus fugere quo populus utitur interdum in couvivio esse interdum ab eo se abstinere modo plus modo amplius assumere etc the sense of the whole passage is that a healthy man under his own government ought not to tie himself up to strict rules nor to abstain from any sort of food in common use that he ought sometimes to feast sometimes to fast sometimes to sleep sometimes to watch more than ordinary etc an unerring regularity is almost impracticable and the swerving from it when it is grown habitual dangerous for every unusual thing in a human body becomes a stimulus as wine or fleshmeat to one not used to them therefore celsuss rule with the proper moral restrictions is a good one for people in health and even in persons diseased in any of the senses of this chapter as too strict too lax acid and bilious etc a constant adherence to one sort of diet may carry the case beyond a cure to the contrary extreme     general rules about diet without regard to particular constitutions are absurd     that with regard to different constitutions the common distinction of diet into vegetable with water and animal with fermented liquors is not proper and complete first because in the enumeration of constitutions in this chapter there is not one that can be limited and restricted by such a distinction nor can perhaps the same person in different circumstances be properly confined to one or the other secondly because a vegetable diet is not uncharacterized there is not a general alimentary quality in which all vegetables agree there are vegetables acid alkaline cooling hot relaxing astringent acrid and mild etc useful or hurtful according to the different constitutions to which they are applied there may be a stronger broth made of vegetables than any gravysoup     as fleshdiet is generally alkalescent and many vegetables are acid and cooling people of hot bilious constitutions find themselves extremely well in a vegetable diet and water and the same persons perhaps had enjoyed their health as well with a mixture of animal diet qualified with a sufficient quantity of acescents as bread vinegar and fermented liquors     the oil of most vegetables in which their nutritious quality chiefly consists seems not to be so hard of digestion as that of animals fat meat is harder to digest than the most oily plant taken as aliment sick people could not take so great a quantity of melted fat as they can of oil of sweet almonds     animal substances are more nourishing and more easily transmutable into animal juices than vegetable and therefore a vegetable diet is more proper for some constitutions as being less nourishing     as the qualities of plants are more various than those of animal substances a diet of some sorts of vegetables may be more effectual in the cure of some chronical distempers than an animal diet     the fibrous or vascular parts of vegetables seem scarce changeable in the alimentary duct the dung of horses is nothing but the filaments of the hay and as such combustible     vegetables abound more with aerial particles than animal substances and therefore are more flatulent   0 man is by his frame as well as his appetite a carnivorous animal the instruments of digestion are so well adapted to the proper food of each animal that from the structure of the first it is easy to guess at the second most quadrupedes that live upon herbs have incisor teeth to pluck and divide them after they are swallowed they are brought up again from one stomach to receive a new alteration by a second mastication after that the mass so prepared passes through four stomachs of different figures and structure before it comes into the intestines this is the case of ruminating animals except some few as of hares who have but one stomach by which it appears that nature is at a great deal of labor to transmute vegetable into animal substances therefore herbeating animals which dont ruminate have strong grinders and chew much there have been several instances of ruminating men and that quality leaving them was a symptom of approaching sickness vid philosoph transact and bonet sepulchret anatom granivorous birds have the mechanism of a mill their maw is the happer which holds and softens the grain letting it drop by degrees into the stomach where it is ground by two strong muscles in which action they are assisted by small stones which they swallow for the purpose and because this action of grinding cannot be performed by the weaker stomachs of their young many of them as pigeons half digest the aliment before they give it some birds that live upon substances easily dissolvable as worms eggs have the coats of the stomachs smooth as cuckows birds of prey that live upon animal substances have membranaceous not muscular stomachs  the best instruments for dividing of herbs are incisor teeth for cracking of hard substances as bones and nuts grinders or millteeth for dividing of flesh sharppointed or dogteeth which seem to be so necessary for that purpose that an eagle has such teeth not in his bill but two at the root of his tongue to hold his prey and three rows in his jaws at the entry of his gullet a human creature has all the three sorts of teeth the teeth and stomachs of some carnivorous beasts dont differ much from the human a lion has generally fourteen in each jaw four incisors four canine and six grinders sharpish for dividing of flesh as well as cracking of bones a human creature has commonly sixteen teeth in each jaw two of them only canine the inward coat of a lions stomach has stronger folds than a human but in other things not much different the stomachs of waterfowl that live upon fish are human therefore it seems that nature has provided human creatures with instruments to prepare and digest almost all sorts of alimentary substances as herbs grain nuts by the structure of their parts as well as appetites they are plainly carnivorous     it has been objected against this doctrine that granivorous animals have a long colon and a caecum which in carnivorous are wanting now it is well known that a man has both vid philosophical transactions to this it is answered that the observation is not true without exceptions many carnivorous animals have neither colon nor caecum and many granivorous have both there are animals not carnivorous that have a large caecum and no colon and others that have neither  there are carnivorous animals i mean such as eat flesh sometimes that have both colon and caecum but as the observation is generally true it proves at least that mankind is designed to take vegetable food sometimes and it is a fresh instance of natures being at more labor to assimilate vegetable into animal substances by affording them a longer and more retarded passage     carnivorous animals have more courage muscular strength activity in proportion to their bulk which is evident by comparing the catkind as lions tigers and likewise the dogkind with herb eating animals of the same bulk birds of prey excel granivorous in strength and courage i know more than one instance of irascible passions being much subdued by a vegetable diet     fermented liquors are proper and perhaps necessary for such as live upon an animal diet for flesh without being qualified with acids as bread vinegar and fermented liquors is too alkalescent a diet and wine moderately taken rather qualifies the heat of animal food than increases it water is the only diluter and the best dissolvent of most of the ingredients of our aliment it is found by experience that water digesteth a full meal sooner than any other liquor but as it relaxeth the constant use of it may hurt some constitutions as it contains no acid it is improper with a diet that is entirely alkalescent  the doctrine laid down in this essay is in most particulars i do not say in all conform to that of the divine hippocrates as appears by several passages of his works particularly of his books of diet of his method of diet in acute diseases and galens commentaries both upon those books and some others of his works i shall instance in some few particulars as far as relates to that part of diet called aliment without refering to the editions books and pages which would be of small use to my readers the maxims of this great man are that health depends chiefly upon the choice of aliment  that the physicians before his time were to be blamed for not prescribing rules of diet  that he who would skilfully treat the subject of aliment must consider the nature of man the nature of aliments and the constitution of the person who takes them  in his books of diet he describes the qualities of all the substances which mankind generally feed upon  as of all sorts of flesh many of which are not in use amongst us as of dogs foxes asses horses  that the flesh of wild animals is dryer than that of tame of stallfed than of those fed by pastorage  that the flesh of animals in the vigor of their age and of such as are castrated is best  that of animals which have not used hard labor is tenderest  that beef is bilious that is alkalescent as all flesh meat is  that the flesh of hot dry countries is most nourishing  he is very particular as to manner of cookery that roasting destroys the humidity  that salted flesh should be macerated and moistened  that salted flesh dries attenuates and moves the belly  he is likewise very curious in tempering the qualities of his meats by seasonings of contrary qualities  he describes the qualities of the flesh of most sorts of fowl that the flesh of granivorous birds is not so moist and oily as that of ducks he is particular as to the qualities of fishes fresh and salted and of all vegetables both alimentary and medicinal that onions leeks radishes etc are hot and acrimonious that some of them as mustard and cresses will occasion a disury that others as letuce are cooling and relaxing selery diuretic mint hot that the cabbage kind resolve the bile that such herbs as are odorous are heating legumes are flatulent ripe fruits laxative and unripe astringent  that unripe cucumbers are hard of digestion  that the fruits of the earth in hot countries are dryer and hotter than in cold  he is no less exact in describing the qualities of milk whey all sorts of bread and water which he chooses clear light without taste or smell drawn not from snow but from springs with an easterly exposition though he seems to have known something of mineral waters he says nothing of the use of them  he is no less accurate in the description of the qualities of several sorts of wines black white austere oily thin with the proper uses of them by which it appears that wine was seldom or never drunk in his country without water he allows wine unmixed after great dissipations of the spirits by fatigue and regulates the quantities of it according to the seasons  he likewise considered the medicinal qualities of aliments and tells you that of aliments some are laxative some moisten some dry some bind some move urine  indeed the qualities which he ascribes to alimentary substances are the four in common use amongst the ancients as hot cold moist and dry according to those his notions are often very just and instructive and nothing can be more so than what follows that acid acrid austere and bitter substances do not nourish but by their astringency create horror that is stimulate the fibers that sweet oily and fat things are nourishing and anodyne that water dilutes and cools than honey is detergent and vinegar profitable to bilious constitutions no less judicious are his intentions in the cure of diseases by aliment  that diseases depend on the parts contained and the parts containing that is on the fluids and solids  that the solid parts were to be relaxed or astricted as they let the humors pass either in too small or too great quantities  that animals consist of fire and water which division is not so uncompleat as one may imagine for by water he seems to understand the unactive and even the solid parts and by fire all the volatile and active parts and that the difference of constitutions consists in the excess or defect of these principles and he compares the due mixture of them to a sort of harmony  that there are in a human body bitter salt sweet acrid and insipid  that contraries are the remedies of their contraries  that health consists in a due proportion of blood pituite and gall  that redundance of blood and gall are the causes of acute distempers  that long abstinence occasions bitterness in the mouth and beating of the temples and he finds fault with the physicians that starved their patients in the beginning of a distemper and gives a reason for it conformable to the principles laid down in this essay that it dried too much that is the liquid parts were dissipated  that a man cannot be healthy and digest his aliment without labor and that the quantity and kind of diet must bear a due proportion to the labor his commentator galen lays down this aphorism  young hot strong and laboring men may feed on meats giving both a hard and gross juice as beef bacon powdered flesh and fish hard cheese ryebread and hard eggs etc which may nourish slowly and be concocted by degrees for if they should eat things of light nourishment either their meat would be too soon digested or else converted into choler  and again milk is fittest for young children tender flesh meat for them that are growing and liquid meats for such as have acute diseases  hippocrates observes that paleness is the effect of acidity  that the choice of diet should be according to the difference of constitutions as in phlegmatic constitutions fish and flesh well seasoned the flesh of fowls which is an alkalescent diet not many vegetables black austere wines in dry temperaments lenitive fruits figs raisins and soft wines in such as have a bad digestion and moist bellies the case of acid constitutions the flesh of fowl which is a diet both alkalescent and of easy digestion for such as have dry bellies pot herbs  galen his commentator tells you that bitter substances engender choler and burn the blood giving no general nourishment to the whole howsoever they may be acceptable to some one part that is according to what was said in this essay that they are a sort of subsidiary gall and again sharp spices are most unfit for tender bodies whose substance is easily melted and inflamed however strong men may eat them with gross meats and consequently by the principles of the essay spices by their melting quality are proper for fat people meats oversalted are dangerous inflammations leprosies sharpness of urine and great obstructions happening to such as use them much agreeing with none but strong bodies as sailers soldiers and husband men accustomed to hard labor and much toiling  fat meats are not good but for dry stomachs for in sanguine and choleric stomachs they are soon corrupted in phlegmatic stomachs they procure looseness and hinder retention  when any man is sick or distempered let his meats be of contrary qualities to his disease for health itself is but a kind of temper gotten and preserved by a convenient mixture of contrarieties accordingly in fevers the aliments prescribed by hippocrates were ptisans and cream of barley decoctions of some vegetables likewise with the mixture of some acid hydromel that is honey and water oxymel honey and vinegar then wines without flavor diluted with water when there was no tendency to a dilirium water vinegar and honey in pleurisies and inflammations of the lungs sometimes he mixeth spices which seems odd but that must have been for promoting expectoration and even in ulcers of the lungs he prescribes fat and salt for the same purpose and to women troubled with pains after childbearing he mixeth his ptisan with leeks and fat which practice no doubt he had found successful  he prescribes great quantities of asses milk as far as an english gallon in proper cases especially as a restorative and to such as had hot dry constitutions asses milk whey and abstinence from fat and oil  no less judicious are his general maxims for preserving of health  a diet moderate in quantity with a due degree of exercise  that such as are of hot constitutions should abstain from violent exercises use bathing in hot water rather than unctions feed upon maize which is his favorite food and pot herbs  that one must not accustom ones self to a too regular diet because the least error is dangerous  that all sudden alterations in extremes either of repletion evacuation heat or cold are dangerous  galen speaking the mind of hippocrates tells us that the whole constitution of body may be changed by diet  that we should take those kinds of meats which are best for our own particular bodies for our particular age temperature distemperature and complexions for as every particular member of the body is nourished with a several qualified juice so laborers and idle persons children and striplings old men and young men cold and hot bodies phlegmatic and choleric complexions must have diverse diets it is easy to produce a great many more instances to prove the conformity of the doctrine of the essay with the notions and practice of hippocrates but those already mentioned are sufficient and may be of use to some readers to confirm by authority what they will not be at the trouble to deduce by reasoning  finis
