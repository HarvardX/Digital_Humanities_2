the triumph of isis a poem occasioned by isis an elegy  quid mihi nescio quam proprio cum tybride romani semper in ore geris referunt si vera parents hanc urbem insano nullus qui mart petivit laetatus violasse redit nec numina sedem destituunt  claudian london printed for w owen at homers head near temple bar  the triumph of isis on closing flowers when genial gales diffuse the fragrant tribute of refreshing dews when chaunts the milkmaid at her balmy pail and weary reapers whistle over the vale charmed by the murmurs of the quivering shade over isis willowfringed banks i strayed and calmly musing through the twilight way in pensive mood i framed the doric lay when lo from opening clouds a golden gleam poured sudden splendours over the shadowy stream and from the wave arose its guardian queen known by her sweeping stole of glossy green while in the coral crown that bound her brow was wove the delphic laurels verdant bough as the smooth surface of the dimply flood the silverslipperd virgin lightly trod from her loose hair the dropping dew she pressed and thus mine ear in accents mild addressed no more my son the rural reed employ nor trill the trifling strain of empty joy no more thy loveresounding sonnets suit to notes of pastral pipe or oaten flute for hark high throned on you majestic walls to the dear muse afflicted freedom calls when freedom calls and oxford bids thee sing why stays thy hand to strike the sounding string while thus in freedoms and in phoebus spite the venal sons of slavish came unite to shake you towers when malice rears her crest shall all my sons in silence idly rest still sing o came thy favorite freedoms cause still boast of freedom  while you break its laws to power your songs of gratulation pay to courts address soft flattrys soothing lay what though your gentle m  ns plaintive verse has hung with sweetest wreaths musaeus hearse what though your vaunted bards ingenuous woe soft as my stream in tuneful numbers flow yet strove his muse by fame or envy led to tear the laurels from a sisters head  misguided youth with rude unclassic rage to blast the beauties of thy whiter page a rage that sullies even thy guiltless lays and blasts the vernal bloom of half thy bays let gr  boast the patrons of her name each pompous fool of fortune and of fame still of preferment let her shine the queen prolific parent of each bowing dean be here is each pr  te of the pampered cheek each courtly chaplain sanctified and sleek still let the drones of her exhaustless hive on fat pluralities supinely thrive still let her senates titled slaves revere nor dare to know the patriot from the peer for tinseld courts their laureled mount despise in stars and strings superlatively wise no longer charmed by virtues golden lyre who sung of old amid the aonian choir where came slowwinding through the breezy reeds with kindly wave his groves of laurel feeds it is ours my son to deal the sacred bay where honor calls and justice points the way to wear the wellearnd wreath which merit brings and snatch a gift beyond the reach of kings scorning and scorned by courts yon muses bower still nor enjoys nor asks the smile of power though wakeful vengeance watch my crystal spring though persecution wave her iron wing and over yon spiry temples as she flies these destined feats be mine exulting cries on isis still each gift of fortune waits still peace and plenty crown my beauteous gates see science walks with freshest chaplets crowned with songs of joy my festal groves resound my muse divine still keeps her wonted state the front erect and high majestic gait green as of old each olivd portal smiles and still the graces build my parian piles my gothic spires in ancient grandeur rise and dare with wonted pride to rush into the ski ah should thou fall forbid it heavenly pow dashed into dust with all thy hundred towers who but would mourn to british virtue dear what patriot could refuse the manly tear what british vid vell paterc lib ii and plutarch in vit marii marius would refuse to weep over mighty carthage fallen a prostrate heap even late when radcliffes delegated train auspicious shone in isis happy plain when you proud the radcliffe library dome fair learnings amplest shrine beneath its attick roofs received the nine mute was the voice of joy and loud applause to radcliffe due and isis honored cause what freeborn crowds adorned the festive day nor blushed to wear my tributary bay how each brave breast with honest ardours heaved when sheldons fane the patriot band received while as we loudly hailed the chosen few romes awful senate rushed upon our view o may the day in latest annals shine that made a beaufort and an harley mine that bade them leave the loftier scene awhile the pomp of guiltless state the patriot toil for bleeding albions aid the sage design to hold short dalliance with the tuneful nine while music left her golden sphere on high and bore each strain of triumph from the sky swelled the loud song and to my chiefs around poured the full paeans of mellifluous sound my naiads blythe the floating accents caught and listening danced beneath their pearly grot in gentle eddies played my wanton wave and all my reeds their softest whispers gave each lay with brighter green adorned my bowers and breathed a fresher fragrance on my flowers but lo at once the swelling concerts cease and crowded theaters are hushed in peace see on yon sage how all attentive stand to catch his darting eye and waving hand hark he begins with all a tullys art to pour the dictates of a catos heart skilled to pronounce what noblest thoughts inspire he blends the speakers with the patriots fire bold to conceive nor timorous to conceal what britons dare to think he dares to tell it is his alike the ear and eye to charm to win with action and with sense to warm untaught in flowery diction to dispense the lulling sounds of sweet impertinence in frowns or smiles he gains an equal prize nor meanly fears to fall nor creeps to rise bids happier days to albion be restored bids ancient justice rear her radiant sword from me as from my country wins applause and makes an oxfords a britannias cause while arms like these my steadfast sages wield while mine is truths impenetrable shield say shall the puny champion fondly dare to wage with force like this scholastic war still vainly scribble on with pert pretense with all the rage of pedant impotence say shall i foster this domestic pest this parricide that wounds a mothers breast thus in some stately ship that long has bore britains victorious cross from shore to shore by chance beneath her close sequestered cells some lowborn worm a lurking mischief dwells eats his blind way and saps with secret toil the deep foundation of the watery pile in vain the forest lent its stateliest pride reared her tall mast and framed her knotty side in vain the thunders martial rage she stood with each fierce conflict of the stormy flood more sure the reptiles little arts devour than waves or wars or eurus wintry power ye venerable bowers ye seats sublime clad in the mossy vest of fleeting time ye stately piles of old munificence at once the pride of learning and defense where ancient piety a matron hoar still seems to keep the hospitable door ye cloisters pale that lengthening to the sight still step by step to musings mild invite ye high arched walls where often the bard has caught the glowing sentiment the lofty thought ye temples dim where pious duty pays her holy hymns of everechoing praise lo your loved isis from the bordring vale with all a mothers fondness bids you hail hail oxford hail of all that is good and great of all that is fair the guardian and the seat nurse of each brave pursuit each generous aim by truth exalted to the throne of fame like greece in science and in liberty as athens learned as lacedaemon free even now confessed to my adoring eyes in awful ranks thy sacred sons arise with every various flower thy temples wreathed that in thy gardens green its fragrance breathed tuning to knightly tale his british reeds thy crowding bards immortal chaucer leads his hoary head oerlooks the gazing choir and beams on all around caelestial fire with graceful step see addison advance the sweetest child of attic elegance to all but his beloved embrace denied see lock leads reason his majestic bride see sacred hammond as he treads the field with goldlike arm uprears his heavenly shield all who beneath the shades of gentle peace best pland the labors of domestic ease who taught with truth or with persuasion moved who soothed with numbers or with sense improved who told the powers of reason or refined all all that strengthened or adorned the mind each priest of health who mixed the balmy bowl to rear frail man and stay the fleeting soul all crowd around and echoing to the sky hail oxford hail with filial transport cry and see yon solemn band with virtuous aim twas theirs in thought the glorious deed to frame with pious plans each musing feature glows and wellweighd counsels mark their meaning brows  vid the elegy page   lo these the leaders of thy patriot line hamden and hooker hyde and sidney shine these from thy source the fires of freedom caught how well thy sons by their example taught while in each breast the hereditary flame still blazes unextinguishd and the same nor all the toils of thoughtful peace engage it is thine to form the hero as the sage i see the sablesuited prince advance with lillies crowned the spoils of bleeding france edward  the muses in yon hallowed

infancy conveyed from gothic rage the helpless virgin bore and fixed her cradle on my friendly shore soon grew the maid beneath his fostring hand soon poured her blessings over the enlightened land though rude the dome and humble the retreat where first his pious care ordained her seat lo now on high she dwells in attic bowers and proudly lifts to heaven her hundred towers he first fair learnings and britannias cause adorned with manners and advanced with laws he bade relent the britons savage heart and formed his soul to social scenes of art wisest and best of kings  with ravished gaze elate the long procession he surveys joyful he smiles to find that not in vain he pland the rudiments of learnings reign himself he marks in each ingenuous breast with all the founder in the race
