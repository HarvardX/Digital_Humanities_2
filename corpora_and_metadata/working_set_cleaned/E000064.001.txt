   during an enthusiastic celebration of american nationhood nationhood moreover was beginning to take on new cultural and intellectual connotations the united states had declared its political independence more than a decade earlier and a rising group of cultural nationalists was asserting that it was now time to declare cultural independence as well the american people would never be truly autonomous otherwise however they may boast of independence and the freedom of their government wrote noah webster lexicographer historian and the nationalists most brilliant spokesman yet their opinions are not sufficiently independent instead of liberating themselves from the influences of english culture as they had from englands arms and government the xiv americans were continuing to manifest an astonishing respect for the arts and literature of their parent country and a blind imitation of its manners while such habitual respect for england was once understandable even laudable it had become an impediment to creating an independent american character and therefore posed dangers for the future  cultural nationalism was almost inevitable in the aftermath of a revolution that seemed to require americans to define not only their political identity but their spiritual identity as well such nationalism manifested itself in a variety of ways in literature and the arts science and education in its superficial manifestations it testified to an american inferiority complex consisting mainly of defensive protests against the notion common in eighteenthcentury europe that the new world was a physically and morally debased version of the old and of mushy effusions of patriotic sentiment over any product of american literature art or science thus one commentator gushed over ramsays the history of the revolution of southcarolina      saying that it reflects honour on this country and gives room for hope that her literary will in time equal her military reputation and rev james madison enthused that the works dress is altogether american another reviewer praising the history of the american resolution observed that it is a necessity that the history of the american revolution be written in our own country by a person of suitable abilities who has witnessed the incidents attendant on that great event  thus did patriotism pass for culture and ramsays work obviously measured up on a more sophisticated level some cultural nationalists—ramsay among them—developed greater insight into the idea of american xv cultural identity these nationalists recognized that along with the richly deserved celebration and selfcongratulation the new nation needed a strong unifying culture without a culture that articulated the fundamental tenets of liberty constitutionalism virtue and simplicity the principles of the american revolution would soon become corrupted such corruption could come from without through the peoples continued reliance on english cultural values it could also come from within through the disintegrating forces already operating to dissolve the new nation into a multitude of disparate fragments this realization prompted the nationalists anxiously to develop a notion of american identity that rested on two major premises that politics culture and society were inextricably intertwined so that a change in any one would subtly alter the others and that culture was a significant force in shaping human consciousness an idea which offered a powerful incentive to use literature as a means of exhortation like all the historians of the revolutionary era ramsay saw historical writing as a vehicle for fostering nationhood an instrument for promoting the kind of unity even homogeneity that the cultural nationalists desired  almost all the leading cultural nationalists were also political nationalists the surest sign of which was that they saw the constitution as the great vehicle for both creating and preserving american unity and although it was possible to be a nationalist culturally while opposing the constitution for political reasons as the historian poet and playwright mercy otis warren made clear ramsays reasons for writing a peculiarly consensual or national history were intimately tied to his federalist political views those reasons were motivated by ramsays perception that the new nation faced two sorts of danger on the one hand the danger of political divisions between the states and within each state divisions which had already given rise to factions with competing economic interests and on the other the threat of social and cultural xvi divisions among the people of the several states and regions which could readily lead to insularity and hostility thus for example he wrote in political terms about his fellow south carolinians who put local interests ahead of national unity and opposed ratification of the constitution to write to speak or even to think of a separation of the states is political blasphemy he wrote to jedidiah morse  one indivisible is my motto  he even postponed publication of his history of the revolution until the fate of the constitution had been decided for the revolution cannot be said to be completed till that or something equivalent is established  but ramsay continued to fear the potential for disunity even after the constitution had been operating for years we should above all things study to promote the union and harmony of the different states he cautioned in      we should consider the people of this country … as forming one whole the interest of which should be preferred to that of every part  while it is impossible to separate his political from his cultural motives ramsay was at his best when he spoke of the importance of historical writing with his cultural concerns in mind in fact in his federalist pamphlet an address to the freemen of southcarolina      he cast one of his strongest political arguments for the constitution in cultural terms he called upon his fellow carolinians to consider the people of all the thirteen states as a band of brethren speaking the same language professing the same religion inhabiting one undivided country and designed by heaven to be one xvii people  ramsay was as sensitive as any intellectual of his era to the kinds of divisions real and potential that tended to separate americans and undermine the unity he sought even ratification of the constitution was less a culmination than a beginning less a sign of unity than a foundation for it we are too widely disseminated over an extensive country  too much diversified by different customs  forms of government to feel as one people which we are he confided to john eliot in      but through historical writings such as jeremy belknaps history of new hampshire      we might become better acquainted with each other in that intimate familiar manner which would wear away prejudices—rub off asperities  mould us into a homogenous people belknaps achievement was all the more remarkable for belknap had written about a single state yet his work breathed a national spirit  in short even in ostensibly local history it was possible—indeed necessary—to write of the nation and its character for such writings tended to unify the people i long to see dr hugh williamsons history of north carolina ramsay wrote to belknap in      indeed i wish to see a history of every state in the union written in the stile and manner of yours  williamss history of vermont we do not know half enough of each other enthusiastic as i am for the unity of our republic i wish for every thing that tends to unite us as one people who know esteem  love each other  in   0  ramsays own the history of southcarolina would join the list of nationalistic state histories ramsays passion for unity and his fear of fragmentation prompted him to invent a national past characterized by consensus this is not to say that ramsay was a dissembler or deceiver who created a past out of whole cloth it is rather to emphasize that for ramsay as for all the historians of the revolution historical writing was not so much an end in itself as it was a means to cultivate the political xviii and moral consciousness of the present and future generations sensitive to divisions within america—political ethnic racial religious economic—ramsay genuinely feared chaos and his experience in both state and confederation politics led him to believe that only by generating a constellation of commonly held values and principles could the nation resist the forces that tended to pull it apart ramsay did not invent those values and assumptions he drew them out of the intellectual climate of revolutionary america and found clues to them in americas past but he focused upon them and molded them into the story of the new nation so that his version of the past appeared to be inevitable thus when ramsay spoke of using history as an instrument of national unity he meant to incite future generations to commit themselves to the principles of revolutionary republicanism 0 ramsay even more than his contemporary historians was experienced in politics knowledgeable about world affairs sensitive to the economic and political interests of his compatriots and had access to a vast number of historical records he knew that americas past had been marked by tensions that from time to time had erupted into open conflict yet he purposefully created an image of the colonial past that diminished the importance of conflicts and portrayed the colonists as revolutionaries—an image of consensus unity and an unfaltering commitment to republican principles in short he attempted to create a national future by inventing a consensual past—to provide an instant tradition for a revolutionary people ramsays principal strategy was to establish a republican lineage an unbroken succession of american generations that were strenuously committed to the principles of revolutionary republicanism from the moment of settlement in the seventeenth century the colonists chief characteristic was that they formed an intellectual even spiritual consensus on three major principles they were politically dedicated to an ordered liberty within the context of law and balanced representative government they were ethically committed xix to the obligations of conscience and the public good so that social life was simple and felicitous and individual conduct marked by industry and prudence and they were convinced philosophically that people are free and efficacious beings who are responsible for their actions and for the consequences their actions bring about it was this constellation of fundamental principles that constituted the american national character as ramsay depicted it and it was to this constellation that he pointed when he exhorted members of his own and future generations to develop cultural unity as a bulwark against division again ramsay insisted that these principles were not new to the revolutionary generation the conflicts between the americans and the british during the    0s and  0s had merely called forth the original settlers character the complex coincidence of geography politics social arrangements and values in colonial america had produced a warm love for liberty a high sense of the rights of human nature and a predilection for independence   from their first settlement the english provinces received impressions favourable to democratic forms of government colonization generally coincided with the struggles in england between parliament and the crown so that the issue of popular government based on consent as contrasted with the divine rights of kings was a current topic of debate the colonists who emigrated to the new world consisted mainly of people who were hostile to the claims of monarchical prerogative they were from their first settlement in america devoted to liberty on english ideas and english principles crucially these ideas were not mere abstractions the colonists not only conceived themselves to inherit the privileges of englishmen but though in a colonial situation actually possessed them   by showing that republican principles and practices had been deeply ingrained in the people for generations ramsay vivified the image of a revolutionary past so far as to suggest that the colonists xx had been independent from the beginning the circumstances under which newengland was planted would a few centuries ago have entitled them from their first settlement to the privileges of independence the colonists had set out at their own expense with no prospects other than hard work to build homes and plant civilization in a wilderness they purchased their lands from the native proprietors and exerted themselves to reap the bounties of nature one hardly needed john locke to make the argument that people who expended their own labor paid for their own lands and voluntarily formed their own governments owed no obligations to britain except those that resulted from their voluntary assent as revealed in express or implied compact and those were manifestly limited the people knew that government rested upon contracts freely entered that taxation and representation were indissolubly joined that they held and alienated their property only by consent that the end of government was the happiness of the people that the people were free to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances and that all proximate means failing the people had the natural right to rebel against tyrannical rule   thus did the colonizing generation consist of protorevolutionaries the colonists were not only republicans in politics they were also dedicated to personal and social practices that conduced to individual happiness and to the public good the state of society in the colonies favoured a spirit of liberty and independence ramsay wrote here the inhabitants were all of one rank kings nobles and bishops were unknown to them the people were unaccustomed to that distinction of ranks which characterized european society and they were strongly impressed with an opinion that all men are by nature equal the colonists religious practices also nurtured a love for liberty the majority were protestants ramsay noted and all protestantism is founded on a strong claim to natural liberty and the right of private judgment there were of course numerous sects but they all agreed in the communion of liberty and all reprobated the courtly doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance nor were the colonists subjected to the pernicious effects xxi of the luxury and opulence indulged in by the courts of europe instead inured from their early years to the toils of a country life they dwelled in the midst of rural plenty colonial american society in short was characterized by simplicity of manners and habits of industry prudence and morality the colonists experience thus gave a cast of independence to the manners of the people and diffused among them the exalting sentiments of liberty   given the colonists ingrained political and social values and their commitment to the principles of liberty and democratic government it was obvious that the american revolution was not a sudden upsurge of resentment against particular acts of parliament resistance and revolution were the inevitable and justifiable responses of a people long habituated to such values the genius of the americans—that is their original republican habits and sentiments—had prepared them to resist encroachments on their rights and to form popular governments during the revolutionary era this was the final element in ramsays message to future generations confronted with arbitrary power the colonists had established a tradition of showing the courage of their convictions resisting inroads against their liberties and taking responsibility for the future   but why should ramsay have presented this manifestly onedimensional image of the colonists as strenuous republicans committed to simplicity industry prudence equality and natural rights to some extent he actually did see them as american revolutionaries in the making for so powerful was the republican synthesis in his own day that it shaped his ideas and experience and predisposed xxii him to see all of history in its terms   yet this will not entirely explain ramsays oversimplifications which seem drastic insofar as his history contains little or no intercolonial rivalry popular uprisings against proprietary governors political strife among competing interest groups ethnic tensions religious intolerances or class divisions even slavery appears in ramsays history as a mitigated evil which while manifestly wrong at least had produced sentiments of liberty and independence among the masters   if for five or six xxiii generations the americans had held the deeply ingrained political social moral and philosophical principles that ramsay described and if they had experienced a minimum of conflict then why did ramsay have to remind his readers of the american tradition above all else the answer contains three parts first as noted earlier there were ramsays apprehensions he feared that disunity would rend the fabric of the new nation—indeed that without shared assumptions principles and values as well as a federal constitution america might even separate into thirteen autonomous states or into two or three regional governments in either case it would become prey to the great european powers even if it did not destroy itself from within   second ramsay feared that the great tradition particularly its powerful moral elements had been badly damaged by the war throughout the war years and into the    0s ramsay expressed his doubts whether the people had sufficient moral courage to make a republican experiment work within a year of delivering his stirring vision of an american republican future in his oration on the advantages of american independence      he wrote to william henry drayton that a spirit of moneymaking has eaten up our patriotism to benjamin rush he added i most devoutly wish for peace our morals are more depreciated than our currency  that is bad enough by      he was worried that this revolution has introduced so much anarchy that it will take half a century to eradicate the licentiousness of the people i wish for the honor of human nature that in these last ages of the world it may appear that mankind are capable of enjoying the blessings of freedom without the extravagancies that usually accompany it by      the theme of internal corruption had become more insistent and urgent i feel xxiv with you the declension of our public virtue he wrote to john eliot liberty which ought to produce every generous principle has not in our republics been attended with its usual concomitants pride luxury dissipation  a long train of unsuitable vices have overwhelmed our country and within a year he expressed the ultimate fear we have neither honesty nor knowledge enough for republican governments … during the war we thought the termination of that would end all our troubles it is now ended three years  our public situation is as bad as ever    the third part of the answer is that historical writings like fourth of july orations sermons and all the powers of eloquence had the capacity to shape thought and thus historians like ministers and politicians had an obligation to use their writings to counteract that ruinous propensity we have for foreign superfluities  to excite us to the long neglected virtues of industry  frugality 0 history in short was a moral art that was why ramsay praised belknaps and williamss histories that was why he believed that john eliots biographical dictionary rendered an essential service to the living by holding up so many excellent models for their imitation from the illustrious dead and that was why he deliberately omitted conflict and strife in the colonial past   indeed ramsay once drew an instructive analogy between history and fiction novelists take fiction  make it a vehicle of their opinions on a variety of subjects he observed i take truth  the facts of history for the same purpose   ramsay was well aware that he was using art in the service of history and history in the service of morality and national unity had i a voice that could be heard from new hampshire to georgia he said in      it should be exerted in urging the necessity of xxv disseminating virtue and knowledge among our citizens his histories represented that voice ramsays voice was in fact heard all over america and over much of europe as well   between      when he was thirtysix and his death in      he published three histories—two on south carolina and the history of the american revolution—that remain significant after two hundred years he also wrote numerous other works ranging from an analysis of yellow fever and well water in charleston to a eulogy on the death of his friend and mentor benjamin rush to a memoir of his wife martha laurens ramsay to two examples of that distinctively american genre the fourth of july oration even in an age dominated by such philosophes as benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson ramsay is notable for his fertile and restless intellect he entered the sophomore class of the college of new jersey later renamed princeton in      and was graduated three years later at age sixteen for the next five years he taught school in maryland and virginia deciding finally to pursue a career in medicine he enrolled in the newly reorganized medical school of the college of philadelphia which boasted an excellent faculty that included the brilliant twentyfouryearold rush ramsay received his bachelor of physic in      on ramsays graduation rush summarized the talents of his young friend whom he esteemed as far superior to any person we ever graduated at our college his xxvi abilities are not only good but great his talents and knowledge are universal i never saw so much strength of memory and imagination united to so fine a judgment   in      after practicing medicine for a year in cecil county maryland ramsay set out for charleston where he made his home for the rest of his life charleston was then a leading southern city with some   000 inhabitants a growing commerce and a welldefined social hierarchy that divided whites from one another along class lines and whites from blacks along racial lines—clear evidence of the divisions in society to which he was so sensitive and which he deemphasized in his history yet within a year of his arrival this outsider from pennsylvania the son of immigrants and a presbyterian in the midst of an anglican elite had married sabina ellis daughter of a prominent merchant   and within three years he was elected to the south carolina assembly by      ramsay had a seat on the states prestigious privy council he served in the continental congress in      returned to his seat in the state assembly in      served as a delegate to the convention that ratified the south carolina state constitution in      from      to      ramsay was president of the state senate his only disappointment in politics was his resounding defeat by william loughton smith for a seat in the first federal congress   neither his political nor his medical and scientific careers however xxvii seemed to satisfy his intellectual curiosity ramsay turned to historical writing he explained to thomas jefferson when i was in confinement in st augustine in the year      and it has employed my leisure hours ever since   but ramsay was drawn to history and to his national vision by his political experience which convinced him that state government was by turns too timid and too wild to solve many of the problems that arose in the postrevolutionary era there is a languor in the states that forebodes ruin he complained to rush in      he also noted the temporising of the southern states in particular and feared the disintegration of the united states if the constitutional convention did not produce an efficient federal government   politics and government were no better in south carolina they may have been worse the eight years of war in carolina were followed by eight years of disorganization which produced such an amount of civil distress as diminished with some their respect for liberty and independence several apprehended that the same scenes which had taken place in england in the seventeenth century after a long and bloody civil war would be acted over again in america by a fickle people who had neither the fortitude nor the wisdom to govern themselves … peace and liberty were found inadequate to promote public happiness without the aid of energetic government the state legislature either languished and did nothing or legislated too much the best and most courageous act performed by state officials finally was to agree to the constitution that would constrain some of their own power    with firsthand experience of the inefficiencies and vacillations of state government and an urge to cultivate eloquence ramsay began xxviii writing history he announced optimistically in his oration on the advantages of american independence      that the very presence of free republican institutions was bound to produce an exalted literature in an oppressive regime ignorance after all was better than knowledge whereas eloquence is the child of a free state america he predicted will produce poets orators criticks and historians equal to the most celebrated of the ancient commonwealths of greece and italy 0 despite his optimism about the prospects of culture in the new nation ramsay soon faced a grim reality although he became known as americas tacitus and polybius he learned all too quickly that the trade of an author is a very poor one in our new world concerning the history of the revolution of southcarolina he lamented to fellow historian william gordon my advances will not be replaced till i have sold  00 copies  my debts contracted and yet unpaid will require the sale of  00 more the edition has cost me  000 dollars the printers bill is   00 dollars the engravings  00 the binding    0 a copy in short i have no brilliant pecuniary prospects before me   yet despite the financial failure of his south carolina history ramsay immersed himself in the history of the american revolution during his tenure in the continental congress here he had access to people prominent on a national level and to an enormous archive he predicted to rush that i can write the general history of the revolution with more ease than i have wrote a part of it indeed i have got the facts already collected he had ready to hand he said a great many documents from my access to papers … and the regularity of records in the offices of congress i have been enabled to do a great deal in a little time   his facts may have been xxix substantially collected but ramsay made the effort to pose numerous detailed questions to several people about various aspects of the revolution he wrote to rush on several occasions to elias boudinot commissary general of prisoners for the continental army and a member of congress for five years to gouverneur morris member of the new york provincial congress and for four years an assistant minister of finance under robert morris to charles thomson secretary of the continental congress from      to      and to john adams he also sent his manuscript to charles thomson who read it made comments on it and promised to circulate it among other knowledgeable readers   no doubt these inquiries made for a better history but ramsay fared almost as poorly on this work as he had on the previous one he had problems with his printer robert aitken whose work said ramsay offends against every principle of good printing the printing the spelling the ink the form of the lines are in many cases execrable in addition asked the outraged ramsay what think you of his stopping the work on the pretence of want of money though   0 dollars were advanced in the time of the work the whole of which was only to cost   00 dollars   he also complained that he had been cheated by booksellers  printers who were taking far too much of the proceeds of the sales in xxx advertising ramsay was eventually reduced to barter if my books that are unsold could be exchanged for a copy of your state laws or of the laws of the neighboring states he wrote to john eliot i would be most pleased i would exchange them for any good books rather than that they should remain on hand finally ramsay had to swallow the fact that his history had been pirated by john stockdale in london it was bad enough that the errors  blunders of aitkens edition are many and cannot be corrected he wrote to john eliot worse yet stockdale has printed one in london without my consent  many of the copies of aitkens edition are yet on hand ramsay had not yet seen the london edition in april      nor had he any knowledge of it till it was nearly executed needless to say he realized no profit on stockdales editions or on the several that were based on it    ramsays reputation as a historian was excellent throughout his life and for decades afterwards the history of the american resolution has enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the last twentyfive years the only significant dissenting voice in the last two centuries was that of orrin grant libby who showed that ramsay had plagiarized portions of both it and the history of the revolution of southcarolina from the annual register   each issue of the annual register published continuously from      contained a superb history of europe section which for some years was written by edmund burke this section contained a narrative of the most important events in contemporary english history thus during the years between      and      it was filled with news of american xxxi affairs—political military economic along with the sections known as state papers and appendix to the chronicle both of which contained the texts of contemporary documents the history of europe was a comprehensive beautifully written narrative that had the additional merit of being written from an english whig and therefore an antiwar or proamerican standpoint each issue of the annual register went through numerous editions and circulated widely in america   ramsay did in fact lift passages verbatim from the annual register though libby certainly exaggerated in suggesting that ramsay plagiarized a large part of his book on the american revolution either from it or from william gordons work   but even if all the examples are conceded they amount to a very small part of the seven hundred pages more important the plagiarism has no substantial impact on its value to modern readers there is no reason for us to agree with libbys conclusion that because of the plagiarism the history is wellnigh worthless   first scholarly citation as we know it was not an issue for eighteenthcentury writers who honored the practice if at all only in the most irregular and idiosyncratic manner second eighteenthcentury american histories were performances not proofs they more nearly resemble sermons which inspire by enunciating principles and applying them to human situations than scientific or legal discourses which depend for their cogency and persuasiveness on their marshalling of evidence finally and most importantly libbys criticism which spoke to the advocates of scientific historicism at xxxii the start of the twentieth century has become largely irrelevant to most modern readers while we still learn factual information from some of our ancient histories—cotton mathers magnalia christi americana   0  incredibly rich with detail leaps to mind—we do not similarly value the factual nature of ramsays histories with the possible exception of the history of southcarolina   0  hence we are less concerned with having precise information about ramsays sources instead we learn from ramsay the interpreter of his present and his past we learn about the intellectual predilections of the eighteenthcentury historian the values assumptions principles and expectations of one who lived and wrote amidst the events he narrated we learn from the ways in which he shaped history his use of language his sense of the significance of people and events his narrative style his use of history as propaganda as exhortation and as fiction we do not in short rely on ramsay to tell us what happened during the revolution any more than we rely on him for medical advice which included benjamin rushs recommended practice bleeding in most respects we know a great deal more about what happened than he did particularly since we are now the arbiters of what is significant we rely on ramsay not for information but for the ways in which he reveals the sensibility through which the events of his era were

to reprint the original      edition printed by r aitken and son in philadelphia that was the only edition that ramsay actually authorized the others including the popular london edition of      printed by john stockdale were pirated before the promulgation of effective copyright laws aitkens and stockdales editions vary only minutely in numbering the pages aitken omitted page numbers     and     of the first volume so that the text flows directly from page   0 to page     stockdale did not preserve aitkens error we did in order to conform to the pagination of the first edition aitken also rendered page    of volume i as page    we have corrected that error since it has no bearing on the actual pagination and since preserving it would have no value for modern readers stockdales copy of aitkens xl edition like the one we used here may have contained a few illegible passages stockdale must have interpolated at those points and occasionally misread the text we have stayed with the wording of the original by comparing it with another printing ramsay was substantially correct about aitkens execrable printing aitkens punctuation is wildly irregular and his spelling idiosyncratic he transposed letters and abbreviated titles inconsistently and apparently according to some inner vision thus we were faced with numerous choices we have tried here to fulfill the ideal of remaining as faithful to the original text as possible while producing a volume that is accessible to modern readers we have silently corrected the text where errors were obviously the result of the printer—transposed letters misspelled words—and where to preserve the errors would have no realistic scholarly or aesthetic value in a number of instances ramsays punctuation has been modernized most of the time this meant removing dashes erratically placed by todays standards and extraneously placed duplicating a directly preceding or succeeding punctuation mark in rarer instances periods and commas were inserted or removed to correct a glaring omission or a usage that strongly clashed with modern conventions of punctuation as already implied our policy was to make such alterations in as conservative a manner as possible—and thus a number of the original quirks and errors which do have the merit of preserving something of the flavor of the first edition still reside in this one we have in addition rendered lengthy quotations in blockindented form rather than run quotation marks down both sides of paragraphs as in the original we have preserved the page numbers of the original which here appear in brackets in the text we have also preserved ramsays and aitkens marginalia although we have silently corrected dates appearing in the margins where the originals were clearly erroneous and deleted some of the most redundant of the dates that were repeated we have added an index for the convenience of modern readers and researchers four appendices interspersed between chapters rather than included together at the end of the book have been kept in the place originally assigned to them by ramsay and aitken xli acknowledgments in addition to sharing with me his knowledge and writings on ramsay arthur h shaffer graciously read an early version of the introduction and offered useful suggestions i am currently reviewing shaffers authoritative biography of ramsay the manuscript of which arrived unfortunately too late for me to borrow from as liberally as i would have liked upon publication shaffers biography will be as indispensable as brunhouses excellent collection of sources linda levy peck proved again the value of her friendship and her keen eye for bad writing she favored the foreword with several readings helping me to eliminate the gaffes that no longer appear dan mcinerney and bruce kahler two former phd students also read this material and made numerous valuable suggestions bill dennis barbara reynolds and chuck hamilton of liberty fund were as always a delight to work with they took a chance on publishing two early american histories—first mercy otis warrens and then david ramsays—and made the experiences gratifying for me in preparing ramsays history for publication i had the extraordinary experience of coming full circle at the beginning of my graduate career in      i was blessed by having page smith as my mentor and friend at the end of my teaching career there was david ramsay whom page introduced to me along with his passion for the beauty and deceptive simplicity of narrative i have always identified the two david ramsay and page smith no doubt because page has always exemplified for me the finest spirit of the eighteenth century if these volumes were mine rather than ramsays to dedicate i would dedicate them with admiration and respect to page smith lhc xlii xliii preface to the first edition the materials for the following sheets were collected in the year                and      in which years as a member of congress i had access to all the official papers of the united states every letter written to congress by general washington from the day he took the command of the american army till he resigned it was carefully perused and its contents noted the same was done with the letters of other general officers ministers of congress and others in public stations it was intended to have enlarged the work by the insertion of state papers as proofs and illustrations of my positions this i could easily have done and shall do at a future time and in a separate work if the public require it at present i thought it prudent to publish little more than a simple narrative of events without introducing my authorities several of these are xliv already in my history of the revolution of southcarolina and such as are printed may be found in the periodical publications of the day i have endeavoured to give much original matter at a small expence as i write about recent events known to thousands as well as myself proofs are at present less necessary than they will be in future i appeal to the actors in the great scenes which i have described for the substantial truth of my narrative intentional misrepresentations i am sure there are none if there are any from other sources i trust they will be found in small circumstances not affecting the substance october  0        the history of the american revolution volume i     history of the american revolution  chapter i fpage  lpage 0 chapter i of the settlement of the english colonies and of the political condition of their inhabitants   the extensive continent which is now called america was three hundred years ago unknown to three quarters of the globe the efforts of europe during the fifteenth century to find a new path to the rich countries of the east brought on the discovery of a new world in the west       christopher columbus acquired this distinguished honor in the year      but a later navigator americus vespucius who had been employed to draw maps of the new discoveries robbed him of the credit he justly merited of having the country called by his name       in the following year      pope alexander the sixth with a munificence that cost him nothing gave the whole continent to ferdinand and isabella of spain this grant was not because the country was uninhabited but because the nations existing there were infidels and therefore in the opinion of the infallible donor not   entitled to the possession of the territory in which their creator had placed them this extravagant claim of a right to dispose of the countries of heathen nations was too absurd to be universally regarded even in that superstitious age and in defiance of it several european sovereigns though devoted to the see of rome undertook and successfully prosecuted further discoveries in the western hemisphere         henry the seventh of england by the exertion of an authority similar to that of pope alexander granted to john cabot and his three sons a commission to navigate all parts of the ocean for the purpose of discovering islands countries regions or provinces either of gentiles or infidels which have been hitherto unknown to all christian people with power to set up his standard and to take possession of the same as vassals of the crown of england       by virtue of this commission sebastian cabot explored and took possession of a great part of the north american continent in the name and on behalf of the king of england the country thus discovered by cabot was possessed by numerous tribes or nations of people as these had been till then unknown to all other princes or states they could not possibly have owed either allegiance or subjection to any foreign power on earth they must have therefore been independent communities and as such capable of acquiring territorial property in the same manner as other nations of the various principles on which a right to soil has been founded there is none superior to immemorial occupancy from what time the aborigines of america had resided therein or from what place they migrated thither were questions of doubtful solution but it was certain that they had long been sole occupants of the country in this state no european prince could derive a title to the soil from discovery because that can give a right only to lands and things which either have never been owned or possessed or which after being owned or possessed have been voluntarily deserted the right of the indian nations to the soil in their possession was founded in nature it was the free and liberal gift of heaven to them and such as no foreigner could rightfully annul the blinded superstition of the times regarded the deity as the partial god of christians and not as the common father of saints and savages the pervading   influence of philosophy reason and truth has since that period given us better notions of the rights of mankind and of the obligations of morality       these unquestionably are not confined   to particular modes of faith but extend universally to jews and gentiles to christians and infidels unfounded however as the claims of european sovereigns to american territories were they severally proceeded to act upon them by tacit consent they adopted as a new law of nations that the countries which each explored should be the absolute property of the discoverer while they thus sported with the rights of unoffending nations they could not agree in their respective shares of the common spoil the portuguese and spaniards inflamed by the same spirit of national aggrandizement contended for the exclusive sovereignty of what columbus had explored animated by the rancour of commercial jealousy the dutch and portuguese fought for the brazils contrary to her genuine interests england commenced a war in order that her contraband traders on the mexican coast claimed by the king of spain might no longer be searched no farther back than the middle of the present century a contest concerning boundaries of american territory belonging to neither occasioned a long and bloody war between france and england though queen elizabeth and james the first denied the authority of the pope of rome to give away the country of infidels yet they so far adopted the fanciful distinction between the rights of heathens and the rights of christians as to make it the foundation of their respective grants they freely gave away what did not belong to them with no other proviso than that the territories and districts so granted be not previously occupied and possessed by the subjects of any other christian prince or state       the first english patent which was given for the purpose of colonising the country discovered by the cabots was granted by queen elizabeth to sir humphry gilbert but this proved abortive       soon after she licensed walter raleigh to search for heathen lands not inhabited by christian people and granted to him in fee all the soil within  00 leagues of the places where his people should make their dwellings and abidings         under his auspices an inconsiderable colony took possession of a part of the american coast which now forms northcarolina in   honor of the virgin queen his sovereign he gave to the whole country the name of virginia these first settlers and several others who followed them were either destroyed by the natives removed by succeeding navigators or died without leaving any behind to tell their melancholy story for they were never more heard of no permanent settlement was effected till the reign of james the first the national ardor which sprung from the long and vigorous administration of queen elizabeth continued to produce its effects for some time after she had ceased to animate the whole her successor though of an indolent disposition possessed a laudable genius for colonisation naturally fond of novelty he was much pleased with a proposal made to him by some of the projectors of that age for deducing a colony into that part of america commonly called virginia   0   he therefore granted letters patent to thomas gates and his associates by which he conferred on them all those territories in america which were not then possessed by other christian princes or people and which lay between the   th and   th degree of north latitude they were divided into two companies the first consisting of adventurers of the city of london was called the london company the second consisting of merchants of plymouth and some other western towns was called the plymouth company the adventurers were empowered to transport thither as many english subjects as should willingly accompany them and it was declared that the colonists and their children should enjoy the same liberties as if they had remained or were born within the realm   0   the month of april   0  is the epoch of the first permanent settlement on the coast of virginia the name then given to all that extent of country which now forms thirteen states the emigrants took possession of a peninsula on the northern side of jamesriver and erected a town which in honor of their sovereign they called jamestown they soon experienced the embarrassments   which are the usual lot of new settlers in a few months diseases swept away one half of their number those who survived were greatly chagrined by the many vexations incidental to their new and forlorn situation   0   in   0  the southern or london company surrendered their rights to the crown and obtained a new patent there were then added to the former adventurers many of the first nobility and gentry to them and their   successors were granted in absolute property the lands extending from cape comfort along the sea coast southward  00 miles from the same promontory  00 miles northward and from the atlantic westward to the south sea licence was given to transport to virginia all persons willing to go thither the colonists and their posterity were declared to be entitled to the rights of subjects as if they had remained within the realm the company being thus favoured by their sovereign were encouraged to proceed with spirit in supporting and extending their settlement but before this was thoroughly accomplished a great waste of the human species had taken place within  0 years after the foundation of jamestown was laid upwards of  000 english subjects had at different times migrated thither but diseases famine wars with the natives and the other inconveniences of their new settlement had made such havoc among these adventurers that by the end of that period there remained alive only about   00 of that large number the same and other causes continued to operate so forcibly that notwithstanding frequent accessions from new adventurers virginia in    0 sixty three years after the settlement of jamestown contained no more than  0000 inhabitants    0 thirteen years elapsed after jamestown began to be built before any permanent establishment was effected in the northern or second colony various attempts for that purpose had failed nor was the arduous business accomplished till it was undertaken by men who were influenced by higher motives than the extension of agriculture or commerce    0  these men had been called puritans in england from their earnest desires of farther   reformation in the established church and particularly for their aversion to certain popish habits and ceremonies which they deemed sinful from their having been abused to idolatry such was the intolerance of the times and so violent the zeal for uniformity that popular preachers of this sect though men of learning and piety were suspended deprived imprisoned and ruined for their not using garments or ceremonies which their adversaries acknowledged to be indifferent puritanism nevertheless gained ground on experiment it was found that no attempts are more fruitless than those which are made with the view of bringing men to think alike on the subject of religion the leaders both of church and state were too little acquainted with the genuine   principles of policy and christianity to apply the proper remedy for preserving peace among discording sects instead of granting a general liberty of conscience compulsory methods were adopted for enforcing uniformity       an act was passed for punishing all who refused to come to church or were present at any conventicle or meeting the punishment was imprisonment till the convicted agreed to conform and made a declaration of his conformity if that was not done in three months he was to quit the realm and go into perpetual banishment in case he did not depart within the time limited or returned afterwards without a license he was to suffer death such is the renitency of the human mind to all impositions on conscience that the more the puritans were oppressed the more were they attached to their distinguishing opinions and the more did their sect prevail several of them suffered death in preference to purchasing an exemption from legal penalties by doing what in their opinion was wrong it was afterwards resolved to send others who had equally persevered in their nonconformity into banishment many chose to avoid these evils by voluntarily exiling themselves from their native country   0  a congregation of these puritans under the pastoral care of mr john robinson being extremely harassed for their religious opinions resolved to elude their persecutors by removing to holland    0  they continued there   ten years and by hard labor earned a living though they were much esteemed and kindly received by the hollanders they were induced by very cogent reasons to think of a second removal the morals of the dutch were in their opinion too dissolute and they were afraid that their offspring would conform to the bad examples daily before them they had also an ardent desire of propagating religion in foreign lands and of separating themselves from all the existing establishments in europe that they might have an opportunity without interruption of handing down to future ages the model of a pure church free from the admixture of human additions america the colonising of which then excited a considerable share of public attention presented a proper theatre for this purpose after serious and repeated addresses to heaven for direction they resolved to cross the atlantic an application on their behalf was made to their native sovereign king james for full liberty and   freedom of conscience but nothing more could be obtained than a promise that he would connive at and not molest them the hope that when at the distance of  000 miles they would be out of the reach of ecclesiastical courts induced them nevertheless to venture they sailed  0  in number from plymouth in september and arrived at cape cod in the november following    0  before landing they formed themselves into a body politic under the crown of england for the purpose of framing just and equal laws ordinances acts constitutions and offices to which forty one of their number subscribed their names and promised all due submission and obedience after landing they employed themselves in making discoveries till the  0th of december they then fixed on a place for settlement which they afterwards called newplymouth and purchased the soil from its native proprietors    0  these adventurers were now at the commencement of a long and dreary winter at an immense distance from their former habitations on the strange coast of an uncultivated country without a friend to welcome their arrival or a house to shelter them in settling down on bare creation they had every   obstacle to surmount that could prove their firmness or try their patience the climate was unfavourable the season cold and pinching the prospect of obtaining a supply of provisions by cultivating the stubborn soil required an immensity of previous labor and was both distant and uncertain from the disorders occasioned by their tedious voyage with insufficient accommodations together with those brought on them by the fatigues and exertions unavoidable in a new settlement and the rigor of the season they buried forty four persons nearly one half of their original number within six months after their landing animated with a high degree of religious fervor they supported these various hardships with unabated resolution the prospect of an exemption from the tyranny of ecclesiastical courts and of an undisturbed liberty to worship their creator in the way that was agreeable to their consciences was in their estimation a sufficient counterbalance to all that they underwent this handful of people laid the foundation of newengland from them and their subsequent associates have sprung the many thousands that have inhabited massachusetts newhampshire connecticut and rhodeisland the puritans to which sect these primitive  0 emigrants belonged were a plain frugal industrious people who were strict observers of moral and social duties they held that the bible was the sole rule both of faith and practice—that every man was bound to study it and to judge of its meaning for himself and to follow that line of conduct and mode of worship which he apprehended to be thereby required they were also of opinion that no churches or church officers had any power over other churches or officers so as to control them—that all church members had equal rights and privileges—that the imposition of articles of faith modes of worship habits or ceremonies was subversive of natural rights and an usurpation of power not delegated to any man or body of men they viewed church hierarchy and especially the lordly pomp of bishops as opposed to the pure simple and equal spirit of christianity their sufferings for nonconformity disposed them to reflect on the nature   and extent of civil authority and led to a conviction that tyranny whether in church or state was contrary to nature reason and revelation there was a similarity between their opinions of government and those which they held on the subject of religion each strengthened the other both were favourable to liberty and hostile to all undue exercise of authority it is matter of regret that these noble principles of liberty ceased to operate on these emigrants soon after they got power into their hands       in the eleventh year after their settlement in america they resolved that no man should be admitted to the freedom of their body politic but such as were members of some of their churches and afterwards that none but such should share in the administration of civil government or have a voice in any election in a few years more they had so far forgot their own sufferings as to press for uniformity in religion and to turn persecutors in order to accomplish it no better apology can be made for this inconsistent conduct than that the true grounds of liberty of conscience were then neither understood nor practiced by any sect of christians nor can any more satisfactory account of so open a dereliction of former principles be offered than that human nature is the same in all bodies of men and that those who are in and those who are out of power insensibly exchange opinions with each other on a change of their respective situations these intemperate proceedings were    overruled for good as the intolerance of england peopled massachusetts so the intolerance of that province made many emigrate from it and gave rise to various distant settlements which in the course of years were formed into other provincial establishments connecticut rhodeisland and newhampshire were in a great measure shoots from the old venerable trunk massachusetts and their early growth was much accelerated by her impolitic zeal for uniformity the country which was subdivided into these four provinces had been called newengland ever since the year      the propriety of classing them under one general name became more evident from their being settled by the same kind of people who were  0 strongly connected with each other by blood uniformity of manners and a similarity of religious and political sentiments the early population of this northern country was rapid the puritans harrassed for their nonconformity in england passed over to it in great numbers in the short space of twenty years from its first settlement    00 settlers arrived in     vessels about the year    0 from a change of affairs the emigration from old to newengland in a great measure ceased maryland was the third english colony settled in north america but the first which from its beginning was erected into a province of the empire the first and second colonies were many years governed by corporations and in a manner subversive of natural liberty but the third was from its first settlement ruled by laws enacted in a provincial legislature the first emigration to maryland consisting of about two hundred gentlemen chiefly of the roman catholic religion sailed from england in november      and landed near the river potowmack in the beginning of the subsequent year       calvert their leader purchased the right of the aborigines and with their consent took possession of a town which he called st marys he continued carefully to cultivate their friendship and lived with them on terms of perfect amity the lands which had been thus ceded were planted with facility because they had already undergone the discipline of indian tillage food was therefore easily procured the roman catholics unhappy in their native land and desirous of a peaceful asylum went over in great numbers to maryland lord baltimore to whom the province had been granted laid the foundation of its future prosperity on the broad basis of security to    property and of freedom in religion the wisdom of these measures converted a dreary wilderness into a prosperous colony because men exert themselves in their several pursuits in proportion as they are assured of enjoying in safety those blessings which they wish for most never did a people enjoy more happiness than the inhabitants of maryland under cecilius the founder of the province while virginia persecuted the puritans her    severity compelled many to pass over into this new province the assembly of which had enacted that no persons professing to believe in christ jesus should be molested in respect of their religion or in the free exercise thereof the prudence of the one colony acquired what the folly of the other had thrown away mankind then beheld a new scene on the theatre of english america they saw in massachusetts the puritans persecuting various sects and the church of england in virginia actuated by the same spirit harassing those who dissented from the established religion while the roman catholics of maryland tolerated and protected the professors of all denominations in consequence of this liberal policy and the other prudent measures adopted by the rulers of this province it rapidly increased in wealth and population the distractions which convulsed england for    years preceding the restoration in    0 left no leisure for colonising but no sooner was charles the second restored to the throne of his ancestors than it was resumed with greater spirit than ever      soon after that event the restored monarch granted a charter to connecticut which had been previously settled by a voluntary association of persons who held the soil by an indian title without any authority from england by this charter king charles established a pure democracy every power legislative judicial and executive was invested in the freemen of the corporation or their delegates and the colony was under no obligation to communicate its legislative acts to the national sovereign      in the year following a royal charter with a grant of similar powers was conferred on rhodeisland and providence plantations these like connecticut had been previously settled by emigrants chiefly from massachusetts who as an independent people had seated themselves on land fairly obtained from the native proprietors without any authority from the parent state this colony was originally    planted on the catholic principle that every man who submits peaceably to the civil authority may    worship god according to the dictates of his own conscience without molestation and under all the changes it has undergone there has been no departure from that broad basis of universal toleration      in the same year a patent was granted to lord clarendon and others comprehending that extent of country which now forms the states of north carolina south carolina and georgia carolina though settled originally as one government was about the year      divided into two georgia was in the year      formed by george the second into a distinct province in the year      king charles the second gave to his brother james duke of york a patent which included newyork and newjersey these provinces had been previously settled by dutch colonists and held as terrirories of the united netherlands but they were easily reduced to the obedience of the king of england who claimed the country by the right of prior discovery       the duke of york in the same year gave a deed of newjersey to lord berkely and sir george carteret      seventeen years afterwards king charles gave to william penn a patent for pennsylvania mr penn some time posterior to this obtained a farther grant of the land on the western side of the river delaware and south of pennsylvania which was formed into a separate government and is now the state of delaware notwithstanding these charters mr penn did not think himself invested with the right of the soil till he had purchased it from the native proprietors in the charter of pennsylvania there was no express stipulation as had been inserted in all other colonial patents that the pennsylvanians and their descendants should be considered as subjects born within the realm but clauses were inserted providing that acts of parliament concerning trade and navigation and the customs should be duly observed and it was also stipulated that no custom or other contribution should be laid on the inhabitants or their estates unless by the consent of the proprietary or governor and assembly or by act of parliament in england the omission of the first clause the insertion    of the second and the reservation in favor of parliament in the last may have been occasioned by difficulties    which had then arisen about the rights of the colonists and the power of parliament over them massachusetts had before that time questioned the authority of parliament to tax them and legislate for them the general clause that the colonists should retain all the privileges of englishmen had already been made the basis of claims against which some in the mother country had many objections perhaps the ruling powers of england were sensible that they had previously delegated too much of independence to their colonies and intended to be more guarded in future but their caution was too late had it been seriously intended to control the natural order of events by the feeble force of words and clauses in a charter the experiment ought to have been tried from the first and not reserved for that of pennsylvania which was one of the last granted to the colonies near a century after dr franklin when examined at the bar of the british house of commons explained the matter by saying that the inhabitants from the first settlement of the province relied that the parliament never would or could by virtue of that reservation tax them till it had qualified itself constitutionally for the exercise of such right by admitting representatives from the people to be taxed in the rapid manner just related was the english north american continent parcelled out into distinct governments little did the wisdom of the two preceding centuries foresee of the consequences both good and evil that were to result to the old world from discovering and colonising the new when we consider the immense floods of gold and silver which have flowed from it into europe—the subsequent increase of industry and population the prodigious extension of commerce manufactures and navigation and the influence of the whole on manners and arts—we see such an accumulation of good as leads us to rank columbus among the greatest benefactors of the human race but when we view the injustice done the natives the extirpation of many of    their numerous nations whose names are no more heard—the havoc made among the first settlers—the slavery of the africans to which america has furnished the temptation and the many long and bloody wars which it has occasioned we behold such a crowd of woes as excites an apprehension that the evil has outweighed the good    in vain do we look among ancient nations for examples of colonies established on principles of policy similar to those of the colonies of greatbritain england did not like the republics of greece oblige her sons to form distant communities in the wilds of the earth like rome she did not give lands as a gratuity to soldiers who became a military force for the defence of her frontiers she did not like carthage subdue the neighbouring states in order to acquire an exclusive right to their commerce no conquest was ever attempted over the aborigines of america their right to the soil was disregarded and their country looked upon as a waste which was open to the occupancy and use of other nations it was considered that settlements might be there formed for the advantage of those who should migrate thither as well as of the mother country the rights and interests of the native proprietors were all this time deemed of no account what was the extent of obligations by which colonies planted under these circumstances were bound to the mother country is a subject of nice discussion whether these arose from nature and the constitution or from compact is a question necessarily connected with many others while the friends of union contended that the king of england had a property in the soil of america by virtue of a right derived from prior discovery and that his subjects by migrating from one part of his dominions to another did not lessen their obligations to obey the supreme power of the nation it was inferred that the emigrants to english america continued to owe the same obedience to the king and parliament as if they had never quitted the land of their nativity but if as others contended the indians were    the only lawful proprietors of the country in which their creator had placed them and they sold their right to emigrants who as men had a right to leave their native country and as subjects had obtained chartered permission to do so it follows from these premises that the obligations of the colonists to their parent state must have resulted more from compact and the prospect of reciprocal advantage than from natural obligation the latter opinions seem to have been adopted by several of the colonists particularly in newengland sundry persons of influence in that country always held that birth was no necessary cause of subjection for that the subject of any prince or state had a natural right to remove to any other    state or quarter of the globe especially if deprived of liberty of conscience and that upon such removal his subjection ceased the validity of charters about which the emigrants to america were universally anxious rests upon the same foundation if the right of the sovereigns of england to the soil of america was ideal and contrary to natural justice and if no one can give what is not his own their charters were on several accounts a nullity in the eye of reason and philosophy they could give no right to american territory the only validity which such grants could have was that the grantees had from their sovereign a permission to depart from their native country and negotiate with the proprietors for the purchase of the soil and thereupon to acquire a power of jurisdiction subject to his crown these were the opinions of many of the settlers in newengland they looked upon their charters as a voluntary compact between their sovereign and themselves by which they were bound neither to be subject to nor seek protection from any other prince nor to make any laws repugnant to those of england but did not consider them as inferring an obligation of obedience to a parliament in which they were unrepresented the prospects of advantage which the emigrants to america expected from the protection of their native sovereign and the prospect of aggrandizement which their native sovereign expected from    the extension of his empire made the former very solicitous for charters and the latter very ready to grant them neither reasoned clearly on their nature nor well understood their extent in less than eight years   00 miles of the sea coast were granted away and so little did they who gave or they who accepted of charters understand their own transactions that in several cases the same ground was covered by contradictory grants and with an absurdity that can only be palliated by the ignorance of the parties some of the grants extended to the south sea over a country whose breadth is yet unknown and which to this day is unexplored ideal as these charters were they answered a temporary purpose the colonists reposed confidence in them and were excited to industry on their credit they also deterred foreign european powers from disturbing them because agreeably to the late law of nations relative to the appropriation of newly discovered heathen countries    they inferred the protection of the sovereign who gave them they also opposed a barrier to open and gross encroachments of the mother country on the rights of the colonists a particular detail of these is not now necessary some general remarks may nevertheless be made on the early periods of colonial history as they cast light on the late revolution long before the declaration of independence several of the colonies on different occasions declared that they ought not to be taxed but by their own provincial assemblies and that they considered subjection to acts of a british parliament in which they had no representation as a grievance it is also worthy of being noted that of the    colonies which have been lately formed into states no one georgia excepted was settled at the expence of government towards the settlement of that southern frontier considerable sums have at different times been granted by parliament but the twelve more northern provinces have been wholly settled by private adventurers without any advances from the national treasury it does not appear from existing records that any compensation for their lands was ever made to the    aborigines of america by the crown or parliament of england but policy as well as justice led the colonists to purchase and pay for what they occupied this was done in almost every settlement and they prospered most who by justice and kindness took the greatest pains to conciliate the good will of the natives it is in vain to look for well balanced constitutions in the early periods of colonial history till the revolution in the year      a period subsequent to the settlement of the colonies england herself can scarcely be said to have had a fixed constitution at that eventful era the line was first drawn between the privileges of subjects and the prerogatives of sovereigns the legal and constitutional history of the colonies in their early periods therefore affords but little instruction it is sufficient in general to observe that in less than eighty years from the first permanent english settlement in north america the two original patents granted to the plymouth and london companies were divided and subdivided into twelve distinct and unconnected provinces and in fifty years more a thirteenth by the name of georgia was added to the southern extreme of previous establishments    to each of these after various changes there was ultimately granted a form of government resembling in its most essential parts as far as local circumstances would permit that which was established in the parent state a minute description of constitutions which no longer exist would be both tedious and unprofitable in general it may be observed that agreeably to the spirit of the british constitution ample provision was made for the liberties of the inhabitants the prerogatives of royalty and dependence on the mother country were but feebly impressed on the colonial forms of government in some of the provinces the inhabitants chose their governors and all other public officers and their legislatures were under little or no controul in others the crown delegated most of its power to particular persons who were also invested with the property of the soil in those which were most immediately dependent on the king he exercised no higher prerogatives over the colonists than over their fellow    subjects in england and his power over the provincial legislative assemblies was not greater than what he was constitutionally vested with over the house of commons in the mother country from the acquiescence of the parent state the spirit of her constitution and daily experience the colonists grew up in a belief that their local assemblies stood in the same relation to them as the parliament of great britain to the inhabitants of that island the benefits of legislation were conferred on both only through these constitutional channels it is remarkable that though the english possessions in america were far inferior in natural riches to those which fell to the lot of other europeans yet the security of property and of liberty derived from the english constitution gave them a consequence to which the colonies of other powers though settled at an earlier day have not yet attained the wise and liberal policy of england towards her colonies during the first century and a half after their settlement had a considerable influence in exalting them to this preeminence she gave them full liberty to govern themselves by such laws as their local legislatures thought necessary and left their trade open to every individual in her dominions she also gave them the amplest permission to pursue their respective interests in such manner as they thought proper and reserved little for herself but the benefit    of their trade and that of a political union under the same head the colonies founded by other powers experienced no such indulgences portugal and spain burdened theirs with many vexatious regulations gave encouragement only to what was for their own interest and punished whatever had a contrary tendency france and holland did not adopt such oppressive maxims but were in fact not much less rigorous and coercive they parted as it were with the propriety of their colonies to mercantile associations which sold to the colonists the commodities of europe at an enormous advance and took the produce of their lands at a low price and at the same time discouraged the growth of any more than they could dispose of at excessive profits these oppressive regulations were followed    with their natural consequences the settlements thus restricted advanced but slowly in population and in wealth the english colonies participated in that excellent form of government with which their parent isle was blessed and which had raised it to an admirable height of agriculture commerce and manufactures after many struggles it had been acknowledged to be essential to the constitution of greatbritain that the people could not be compelled to pay any taxes nor be bound by any laws but such as had been granted or enacted with the consent of themselves or of their representatives it was also one of their privileges that they could not be affected either in their property their liberties or their persons but by the unanimous consent of twelve of their peers from the operation of these general principles of liberty and the wise policy of great britain her american settlements increased in number wealth and resources with a rapidity which surpassed all previous calculations neither antient nor modern history can produce an example of colonies governed with equal wisdom or flourishing with equal rapidity in the short space of   0 years their numbers increased to three millions and their commerce to such a degree as to be more than a third of that of great britain they also extended their settlements   00 miles on the sea coast and  00 miles to the westward their rapid population though partly accelerated by the influx of strangers was principally owing to internal causes in consequence of the equality of fortune and simplicity of manners which prevailed among them their inhabitants multiplied far beyond  0 the proportion of old nations corrupted and weakened by the vices of wealth and above all of vanity than which perhaps there is no greater enemy to the increase of the human species the good effects of a wise policy and equal government were not only discernible in raising the colonies of england to a preeminence over those of other european powers but in raising some among themselves to greater importance than others their relative population and wealth were by no means correspondent to their respective  0 advantages of soil and climate from the common disproportion between the natural and artificial wealth of different countries it seems to be a general rule that the more nature does for any body of men the less they are disposed to do for themselves the newengland provinces though possessed of comparatively a barren country were improved much faster than others which were blessed with a superior soil and milder climate their first settlers were animated with a high degree of that religious fervor which excites to great undertakings they also settled their vacant lands on principles of the wisest policy instead of granting large tracts to individuals they sold the soil in small farms to those who personally cultivated the same instead of disseminating their inhabitants over an extensive country they formed successive settlements in townships of six miles square they also made such arrangements in these townships as coextended the blessings of education and of religious instruction with their settlements by these means industry and morality were propagated and knowledge was generally diffused in proportion to their respective numbers it is probable that no other country in the world contained more sober orderly citizens and fewer who were profligate and abandoned those high crimes which are usually punished with death were so rare in newengland that many years have elapsed in large populous settlements without a single execution their less fertile soil disposed them to a spirit of adventure and their victorious industry rose superior to every obstacle in carrying on the whale fishery they not only penetrated the deepest frozen recesses of hudsons bay and davis straits but pierced into the opposite regions of polar cold while some of them were striking the harpoon on the coast of africa others pursued their gigantic game near the shores of brazil while they were yet    in their infancy as a political society they carried on this perilous business to an extent exceeding all that the perseverance of holland the activity of france or the vigor of english enterprize had ever accomplished a spirit of liberty prompted their    industry and a free constitution guarded their civil rights the country was settled with yeomanry who were both proprietors and cultivators of the soil luxury was estranged from their borders enervating wealth and pinching poverty were both equally rare early marriages and a numerous offspring were common—thence population was rapid and the inhabitants generally possessed that happy state of mediocrity which favors the improvement both of mind and body newyork adjoined newengland but did not encrease with equal rapidity a few by monopolizing large tracts of land reduced many to the necessity of being tenants or of removing to other provinces where land could be obtained on more favourable terms the encrease of population in this province was nevertheless great when compared with that of old countries this appears from the following statement of their numbers at different periods in      the province of newyork contained       whites and in             an increase of nearly two for one in the space of fifteen years pennsylvania was at first settled under the auspices of the celebrated william penn who introduced a number of industrious inhabitants chiefly of the sect of quakers the population of this country advanced equally with that of the newengland provinces among the inducements operating on foreigners to settle in pennsylvania was a most excellent form of provincial government which secured the religious as well as the civil rights of its inhabitants while the mother country laboured under an oppressive ecclesiastical establishment and while partialities of the same kind were sanctioned by law in some of the american provinces perfect liberty of conscience and an exact equality of all sects was in every period a part of the constitution of pennsylvania quaker simplicity industry and frugality contributed in like manner to the flourishing of that province the habits of that plain people correspond admirably with a new country and with republican constitutions opposed to idleness and extravagance they combined the whole    force of religion with customs and laws    to exile these vices from their society the first quaker settlers were soon followed by germans whose industry was not inferior to their own the emigrants from other countries who settled in pennsylvania followed these good examples and industry and frugality became predominant virtues over the whole province the policy of a loanoffice was also eminently beneficial the proprietaries of pennsylvania sold their lands in small tracts and on long credit the purchasers were indulged with the liberty of borrowing on interest paper bills of credit out of the loanoffice on the mortgage of their lands perhaps there never was an institution which contributed more to the happiness of the people or to the flourishing of a new country than this land loanoffice scheme the province being enriched by the clear interest of its loaned paper was thereby enabled to defray the expences of government with moderate taxes the industrious farmer was furnished with the means of cultivating and stocking his farm these improvements by increasing the value of the land not only established the credit of the paper but enabled the borrower in a few years to pay off the original loan with the productions of the soil the progressive improvements of pennsylvania may be estimated from the increase of its trade in the year   0  that province imported goods from the mother country amounting in value only to £      sterling but in      to the value of £ 0  0  an encrease of nearly fifty for one in little more than half a century in maryland and virginia a policy less favourable to population and somewhat different from that of pennsylvania took place the church of england was incorporated with the first settlement of virginia and in the lapse of time it also became the established religion of maryland in both these provinces long before the american revolution that church possessed a legal preeminence and was maintained at the expence not only of its own members but of all other denominations these deterred great numbers especially of the presbyterian    denomination who had emigrated from ireland from settling within the limits of these governments and fomented a spirit of discord between those who belonged to and those who dissented from the established church in these and the other southern provinces domestic slavery was    common though it was not by law forbidden any where yet there were comparatively few slaves any where to the northward of maryland the peaceable and benevolent religion of the quakers induced their united opposition to all traffic of the human race many individuals of other denominations in like manner discountenanced it but the principal ground of difference on this head between the northern and southern provinces arose less from religious principles than from climate and local circumstances in the former they found it to be for their interest to cultivate their lands with white men in the latter with those of an opposite colour the stagnant waters and low lands which are so frequent on the shores of maryland and virginia and on the coasts and near the rivers in the southern provinces generate diseases which are more fatal to whites than blacks there is a physical difference in the constitution of these varieties of the human species the latter secrete less by the kidnies and more by the glands of the skin than the former this greater degree of transpiration renders the blacks more tolerant of heat than the whites the perspirable matter thrown off by the former is more foetid than that of the latter it is perhaps owing to these circumstances that blacks enjoy better health in warm and marshy countries than whites it is certain that a great part of the low country in several of the provinces must have remained without cultivation if it had not been cultivated by black men from imagined necessity founded on the natural state of the country domestic slavery seemed to be forced on the southern provinces it favored cultivation but produced many baneful consequences it was particularly hostile to the proper education of youth industry temperance and abstinence virtues essential to the health and vigor of both mind and body were with difficulty    practised where the labour of slaves procured an abundance not only of the necessaries but of the delicacies of life and where daily opportunities and facilities were offered for early excessive and enervating indulgences slavery also led to the engrossing of land in the hands of a few it impeded the introduction of labouring freemen and of course diminished the capacity of the country for active defence and at the same time endangered internal tranquility by multiplying a species of inhabitants who had no    interest in the soil for if a slave can have a country in the world it must be any other in preference to that in which he is compelled to labour for a master such is the force of habit and the pliancy of human nature that though degrading freemen to the condition of slaves would to many be more intolerable than death yet negroes who have been born and bred in habits of slavery are so well satisfied with their condition that several have been known to reject proffered freedom and as far as circumstances authorize us to judge emancipation does not appear to be the wish of the generality of them the peasantry of few countries enjoy as much of the comforts of life as the slaves who belong to good masters interest concurs with the finer feelings of human nature to induce slaveholders to treat with humanity and kindness those who are subjected to their will and power there is frequently more happiness in kitchens than parlours and life is often more pleasantly enjoyed by the slave than his master the political evils of slavery do not so much arise from the distresses it occasions to slaves as from its diminishing the incitements to industry and from its unhappy influence on the general state of society where it is common a few grow rich and live in ease and luxury but the community is deprived of many of its resources for independent happiness and depressed to a low station on the scale of national greatness the aggregate industry of a country in which slaves and freemen are intermixed will always be less than where there is a number of freemen equal to both nothing stimulates to industry so much as interest the man who works for another will contrive many artifices to make    that work as little as possible but he who has an immediate profit from his labor will disregard tasks times and seasons in settlements where the soil is cultivated by slaves it soon becomes unfashionable for freemen to labor than which no greater curse can befal a country the individuals who by the industry of their slaves are released from the necessity of personal exertions will be strongly tempted to many practices injurious to themselves and others idleness is the parent of every vice while labor of all kinds favours and facilitates the practice of virtue unhappy is that country where necessity compels the use of slaves and unhappy are the people where the original decree of heaven that man should eat his bread in the sweat of his face is by any means whatever generally eluded    the influence of these causes was so extensive that though the southern provinces possessed the most fruitful soil and the mildest climate yet they were far inferior to their neighbours in strength population industry and aggregate wealth this inferiority increased or diminished with the number of slaves in each province contrasted with the number of freemen the same observation held good between different parts of the same province the sea coast which from necessity could be cultivated only by black men was deficient in many of the enjoyments of life and lay at the mercy of every bold invader while the western country where cultivation was more generally carried on by freemen though settled at a later period sooner attained the means of self defence and relatively a greater proportion of those comforts with which a cultivated country rewards its industrious inhabitants in the southern provinces the long credit given by british merchants was a principal source of their flourishing the immense capitals of the merchants trading to the north american continent enabled them to extend credit to the term of several years they received a profit on their goods and an annual interest of five per cent on the sums for which they were sold this enabled the american merchant to extend credit to the    planter from whom he received a higher interest than he paid in greatbritain the planters being furnished on credit with slaves and every thing necessary for the cultivation of their lands when careful and industrious cleared so much more than the legal interest with which they were charged that in a few years of successful planting the difference enabled them to pay their debts and clear their capital by the help of credit a beneficial intercourse was established which redounded to the benefit of both parties these causes eminently contributed to the prosperity of the english provinces others besides cooperating to the same end produced a warm love for liberty a high sense of the rights of human nature and a predilection for independence the first emigrants from england for colonising america left the mother country at a time when the dread of arbitrary power was the predominant passion of the nation except the very modern charter of georgia in the year      all the english colonies obtained their charters and their greatest number of european settlers between    the years   0  and      in this period a remarkable struggle between prerogative and privilege commenced and was carried on till it terminated in a revolution highly favourable to the liberties of the people in the year      when the english house of commons claimed freedom of speech as their ancient and undoubted right and an inheritance transmitted to them from their ancestors king james the first replied that he could not allow of their style in mentioning their ancient and undoubted rights but would rather have wished they had said that their privileges were derived from the grace and permission of their sovereign this was the opening of a dispute which occupied the tongues pens and swords of the most active men in the nation for a period of seventy years it is remarkable that the same period is exactly coincident with the settlement of the english colonies james educated in the arbitrary sentiments of the divine right of kings conceived his subjects to be his property and that their privileges were    matters of grace and favour flowing from his generosity this high claim of prerogative excited opposition in support of the rights of the people in the progress of the dispute charles the first son of king james in attempting to levy shipmoney and other revenues without consent of parliament involved himself in a war with his subjects in which after various conflicts he was brought to the block and suffered death as an enemy to the constitution of his country though the monarchy was restored under charles the second and transmitted to james the second yet the same arbitrary maxims being pursued the nation tenacious of its rights invited the prince of orange to the sovereignty of the island and expelled the reigning family from the throne while these spirited exertions were made in support of the liberties of the parent isle the english colonies were settled and chiefly with inhabitants of that class of people which was most hostile to the claims of prerogative every transaction in that period of english history supported the position that the people have a right to resist their sovereign when he invades their liberties and to transfer the crown from one to another when the good of the community requires it the english colonists were from their first settlement in america devoted to liberty on english ideas and english principles they    not only conceived themselves to inherit the privileges of englishmen but though in a colonial situation actually possessed them after a long war between king and parliament and a revolution—these were settled on the following fundamental principles that it was the undoubted right of english subjects being freemen or freeholders to give their property only by their own consent that the house of commons exercised the sole right of granting the money of the people of england because that house alone represented them that taxes were the free gifts of the people to their rulers that the authority of sovereigns was to be exercised only for the good of their subjects that it was the right of the people to meet together and peaceably to consider of their grievances—   to petition for a redress of them and finally when intolerable grievances were unredressed to seek relief on the failure of petitions and remonstrances by forcible means opinions of this kind generally prevailing produced among the colonists a more determined spirit of opposition to all encroachments on their rights than would probably have taken place had they emigrated from the mother country in the preceding century when the doctrines of passive obedience non resistance and the divine right of kings were generally received that attachment to their sovereign which was diminished in the first emigrants to america by being removed to a great distance from his influence was still farther diminished in their descendants when the american revolution commenced the inhabitants of the colonies were for the most part the third and fourth and sometimes the fifth or sixth generation from the original emigrants in the same degree as they were removed from that parent stock they were weaned from the partial attachment which bound their forefathers to the place of their nativity the affection for the mother country as far as it was a natural passion wore away in successive generations till at last it had scarcely any existence that mercantile intercourse which connects different countries was in the early periods of the english colonies far short of that degree which is necessary to perpetuate a friendly union had the first great colonial establishments been made in the southern provinces    where the suitableness of native commodities would have maintained a brisk and direct trade with england—the constant exchange of good offices between the two countries would have been more likely to perpetuate their friendship but as the eastern provinces were the first which were thickly settled and they did not for a long time cultivate an extensive trade with england their descendants speedily lost the fond attachment which their forefathers felt to their parent state the bulk of the people in new england knew little of the mother country having only heard of her as a distant kingdom the rulers    of which had in the preceding century persecuted and banished their ancestors to the woods of america the distance of america from great britain generated ideas in the minds of the colonists favourable to liberty three thousand miles of ocean separated them from the mother country seas rolled and months passed between orders and their execution in large governments the circulation of power is enfeebled at the extremities this results from the nature of things and is the eternal law of extensive or detached empire colonists growing up to maturity at such an immense distance from the seat of government perceived the obligation of dependence much more feebly than the inhabitants of the parent isle who not only saw but daily felt the fangs of power the wide extent and nature of the country contributed to the same effect the natural seat of freedom is among high mountains and pathless deserts such as abound in the wilds of america the religion of the colonists also nurtured a love for liberty they were chiefly protestants and all protestantism is founded on a strong claim to natural liberty and the right of private judgement a majority of them were of that class of men who in england are called dissenters their tenets being the protestantism of the protestant religion are hostile to all interference of authority in matters of opinion and predispose to a jealousy for civil liberty they who belonged to the church of england were for the most part independents as far as church government and hierarchy were concerned they used the liturgy of that church but were without bishops and were strangers to those systems which make religion an engine of state that policy which unites the lowest curate with the greatest    metropolitan and connects both with the sovereign was unknown among the colonists their religion was their own and neither imposed by authority nor made subservient to political purposes though there was a variety of sects they all agreed in the communion of liberty and all reprobated the courtly doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance the same dispositions were fostered by the usual  0 modes of education in the colonies the study of law was common and fashionable the infinity of disputes in a new and free country made it lucrative and multiplied its followers no order of men has in all ages been more favourable to liberty than lawyers where they are not won over to the service of government they are formidable adversaries to it professionally taught the rights of human nature they keenly and quickly perceive every attack made on them while others judge of bad principles by the actual grievances they occasion lawyers discover them at a distance and trace future mischiefs from gilded innovations the reading of those colonists who were inclined to books generally favoured the cause of liberty large libraries were uncommon in the new world disquisitions on abstruse subjects and curious researches into antiquity did not accord with the genius of a people settled in an uncultivated country where every surrounding object impelled to action and little leisure was left for speculation their books were generally small in size and few in number a great part of them consisted of those fashionable authors who have defended the cause of liberty catos letters the independent whig and such productions were common in one extreme of the colonies while in the other histories of the puritans kept alive the remembrance of the sufferings of their forefathers and inspired a warm attachment both to the civil and the religious rights of human nature in the southern colonies slavery nurtured a spirit of liberty among the free inhabitants all masters of slaves who enjoy personal liberty will be both proud and jealous of their freedom it is in their opinion not only an enjoyment but a kind of rank and privilege in them the haughtiness of domination combines with the spirit of liberty nothing could more effectually animate the opposition of a planter to the claims of greatbritain than a conviction that those claims in their extent degraded him to a degree of dependence on  0 his fellow subjects equally humiliating with that which existed between his slaves and himself    the state of society in the colonies favoured a spirit of liberty and independence their inhabitants were all of one rank kings nobles and bishops were unknown among them from their first settlement the english provinces received impressions favourable to democratic forms of government their dependent situation forbad any inordinate ambition among their native sons and the humility of their society abstracted as they were from the splendor and amusements of the old world held forth few allurements to invite the residence of such from the mother country as aspired to hereditary honors in modern europe the remains of the feudal system have occasioned an order of men superior to that of the commonality but as few of that class migrated to the colonies they were settled with the yeomanry their inhabitants unaccustomed to that distinction of ranks which the policy of europe has established were strongly impressed with an opinion that all men are by nature equal they could not easily be persuaded that their grants of land or their civil rights flowed from the munificence of princes many of them had never heard of magna charta and those who knew the circumstances of the remarkable period of english history when that was obtained did not rest their claims to liberty and property on the transactions of that important day they looked up to heaven as the source of their rights and claimed not from the promises of kings but from the parent of the universe the political creed of an american colonist was short but substantial he believed that god made all mankind originally equal that he endowed them with the rights of life property and as much liberty as was consistent with the rights of others that he had bestowed on his vast family of the human race the earth for their support and that all government was a political institution between men naturally equal not for the aggrandizement of one or a few but for the general happiness of the whole community impressed with sentiments of this kind they grew up from their earliest infancy with that confidence which is well calculated to inspire a love for liberty and a prepossession in favour of independence    in consequence of the vast extent of vacant country every    colonist was or easily might be a freeholder settled on lands of his own he was both farmer and landlord—producing all the necessaries of life from his own grounds he felt himself both free and independent each individual might hunt fish or fowl without injury to his neighbours these immunities which in old countries are guarded by the sanction of penal laws and monopolized by a few are the common privileges of all in america colonists growing up in the enjoyment of such rights felt the restraint of law more feebly than they who are educated in countries where long habits have made submission familiar the mind of man naturally relishes liberty—where from the extent of a new and unsettled country some abridgements thereof are useless and others impracticable the natural desire of freedom is strengthened and the independent mind revolts at the idea of subjection the colonists were also preserved from the contagion of ministerial influence by their distance from the metropolis remote from the seat of power and corruption they were not overawed by the one nor debauched by the other few were the means of detaching individuals from the interest of the public high offices were neither sufficiently numerous nor lucrative to purchase many adherents and the most valuable of these were conferred on natives of britain every man occupied that rank only which his own industry or that of his near ancestors had procured him each individual being cut off from all means of rising to importance but by his personal talents was encouraged to make the most of those with which he was endowed prospects of this kind excited emulation and produced an enterprising laborious set of men not easily overcome by difficulties and full of projects for bettering their condition the enervating opulence of europe had not yet reached the colonists they were destitute of gold and silver but abounded in the riches of nature a sameness of circumstances and occupations created a great sense of equality and disposed them to union in any common cause    from the success of which they might expect to partake of equal advantages the colonies were communities of separate independent individuals under no general influence but that of their personal feelings and opinions they were not led by powerful families nor by great    officers in church or state residing chiefly on lands of their own and employed in the wholesome labours of the field they were in a great measure strangers to luxury their wants were few and among the great bulk of the people for the most part supplied from their own grounds their enjoyments were neither farfetched nor dearly purchased and were so moderate in their kind as to leave both mind and body unimpaired inured from their early years to the toils of a country life they dwelled in the midst of rural plenty unacquainted with ideal wants they delighted in personal independence removed from the pressures of indigence and the indulgence of affluence their bodies were strong and their minds vigorous the great bulk of the british colonists were farmers or planters who were also proprietors of the soil the merchants mechanics and manufacturers taken collectively did not amount to one fifteenth of the whole number of inhabitants while the cultivators of the soil depend on nothing but heaven and their own industry other classes of men contract more or less of servility from depending on the caprice of their customers the excess of the farmers over the collective numbers of all the other inhabitants gave a cast of independence to the manners of the people and diffused the exalting sentiments which have always predominated among those who are cultivators of their own grounds these were farther promoted by their moderate circumstances which deprived them of all superfluity for idleness or effeminate indulgence the provincial constitutions of the english colonies nurtured a spirit of liberty the king and government of greatbritain held no patronage in america which could create a portion of attachment and influence sufficient to counteract that spirit in popular assemblies which when left to itself illy brooks any authority that interferes with its own    the inhabitants of the colonies from the beginning especially in newengland enjoyed a government which was but little short of being independent they had not only the image but the substance of the english constitution they chose most of their magistrates and paid them all they had in effect the sole direction of their internal government the chief mark of their subordination consisted in their making no laws repugnant to the laws of their mother    country—their submitting such laws as they made to be repealed by the king and their obeying such restrictions as were laid on their trade by parliament the latter were often evaded and with impunity the other small checks were scarcely felt and for a long time were in no respects injurious to their interests under these favourable circumstances colonies in the new world had advanced nearly to the magnitude of a nation while the greatest part of europe was almost wholly ignorant of their progress some arbitrary proceedings of governors proprietary partialities or democratical jealousies now and then interrupted the political calm which generally prevailed among them but these and other occasional impediments of their prosperity for the most part soon subsided the circumstances of the country afforded but little scope for the intrigues of politicians or the turbulence of demagogues the colonists being but remotely affected by the bustlings of the old world and having but few objects of ambition or contention among themselves were absorbed in the ordinary cares of domestic life and for a long time exempted from a great proportion of those evils which the governed too often experience from the passions and follies of statesmen but all this time they were rising higher and though not sensible of it growing to a greater degree of political consequence      one of the first events which as an evidence of their increasing importance drew on the colonies a share of public attention was the taking of louisbourg from france while that country was at war with greatbritain this enterprize was projected by governor shirley of massachusetts and undertaken by the sole authority of    the legislature of that colony it was carried by only a single vote to make the attempt but after the adoption of the measure there was an immediate union of all parties and all were equally zealous in carrying it into execution the expedition was committed to general pepperell and upwards of  000 men were speedily raised for the service and put under his command this force arrived at canso on the  th of april a british marine force from the westindies commanded by commodore warren which arrived in the same month acted in concert with these land forces their combined operations were carried on with so much judgment that on the   th of june the fortress capitulated    the war in which louisbourg was taken was scarcely ended when another began in which the colonies were distinguished parties the reduction of that fortress by colonial troops must have given both to france and england enlarged ideas of the value of american territory and might have given rise to that eagerness for extending the boundaries of their respective colonies which soon after by a collision of claims to the same ground laid the foundation of a bloody war between the two nations it is neither possible nor necessary to decide on the rights of either to the lands about which this contest began it is certain that the prospects of convenience and future advantage had much more influence on both than the considerations of equity as the contending powers considered the rights of the native inhabitants of no account it is not wonderful that they should not agree in settling their own the war was brought on in the following manner about the year      a grant of  00000 acres of land in the neighbourhood of the ohio was made out in favour of certain persons in westminster london and virginia who had associated under the title of the ohio company at this time france was in possession of the country on both sides of the mouth of the mississippi as well as of canada and wished to form a communication between these two extremities of her territories in northamerica she was therefore alarmed at the scheme in agitation by the ohio company    in as much as the land granted to them lay between her northern and southern settlements       remonstrances against british encroachments as they were called having been made in vain by the governor of canada the french at length seized some british subjects who were trading among the twightwees a nation of indians near the ohio as intruders on the land of his most christian majesty and sent them to a fort on the south side of lake erie the twightwees by way of retaliation for capturing british traders whom they deemed their allies seized three french traders and sent them to pennsylvania the french persisting in their claims to the country on the ohio as part of canada strengthened themselves by erecting new forts in its vicinity and at length began to seize and plunder every british trader found on any part of that river repeated complaints of those violences being made to the governor of virginia it was at length determined to send a suitable    person to the french commandant near the ohio to demand the reason of his hostile proceedings and to insist on his evacuating a fort he had lately built major washington being then but little more than    years of age offered his service which was thankfully accepted the distance to the french settlement was more than  00 miles and one half of the rout led through a wilderness inhabited only by indians he nevertheless set out in an uncommonly severe season attended only by one companion from winchester he proceeded on foot with his provisions on his back when he arrived and delivered his message the french commandant refused to comply and claimed the country as belonging to the king his master and declared that he should continue to seize and send as prisoners to canada every englishman that should attempt to trade on the ohio or any of its branches before major washington returned the virginians had sent out workmen and materials to erect a fort at the conflux of the ohio and the monongahela while they were engaged in this work the french came upon them—drove them out of the country and erected a regular fortification on the same spot these spirited    proceedings overset the schemes of the ohio company but its members both in england and america were too powerful to brook the disappointment it was therefore resolved to instruct the colonies to oppose with arms the encroachments of the french on the british territories as these western lands were called in obedience to these instructions virginia raised three hundred men put them under the command of colonel washington and sent them on towards the ohio may          an engagement between them and a party of french took place in which the latter were defeated on this mr de villier the french commandant marched down with  00 men besides indians and attacked the virginians colonel washington made a brave defence behind a small unfinished intrenchment called fort necessity but at length accepted of honorable terms of capitulation from the eagerness discovered by both nations for these lands it occurred to all that a rupture between france and england could not be far distant it was also evident to the rulers of the latter that the colonies would be the most convenient centre of operation for repressing french encroachments to draw forth their colonial    resources in an uniform system of operations then for the first time became an object of public attention       to digest a plan for this purpose a general meeting of the governors and most influential members of the provincial assemblies was held at albany the commissioners at this congress were unanimously of opinion that an union of the colonies was necessary and they proposed a plan to the following effect that a grand council should be formed of members to be chosen by the provincial assemblies which council together with a governor to be appointed by the crown should be authorised to make general laws and also to raise money from all the colonies for their common defence the leading members of the provincial assemblies were of opinion that if this plan was adopted they could defend themselves from the french without any assistance from greatbritain this plan when sent to england was not acceptable to the ministry and in lieu thereof they    proposed that the governors of all the colonies attended by one or two members of their respective councils which were for the most part of royal appointment should from time to time concert measures for the whole colonies—erect forts and raise troops with a power to draw upon the british treasury in the first instance but to be ultimately reimbursed by a tax to be laid on the colonies by act of parliament this was as much disrelished by the colonists as the former plan had been by the british ministry the principle of some general power operating on the whole of the colonies was still kept in mind though dropped for the present the ministerial plan laid down above was transmitted to governor shirley and by him communicated to dr franklin and his opinion thereon requested that sagacious patriot sent to the governor an answer in writing with remarks upon the proposed plan in which by his strong reasoning powers on the first view of the new subject he anticipated the substance of a controversy which for twenty years employed the tongues pens and swords of both countries the policy of repressing the encroachments of the french on the british colonies was generally approved both in england and america it was therefore resolved to take effectual measures for driving them from the ohio and also for reducing niagara crownpoint and the other posts which they held within the limit claimed by the king of greatbritain    to effect the first purpose general braddock was sent from ireland to virginia with two regiments and was there joined by as many more as amounted in the whole to   00 men he was a brave man but destitute of the other qualifications of a great officer his haughtiness disgusted the americans and his severity made him disagreeable to the regular troops he particularly slighted the country militia and the virginia officers colonel washington begged his permission to go before him and scour the woods with his provincial troops who were well acquainted with that service but this was refused      june    the general with   00 men pushed on incautiously till he    fell into an ambuscade of french and indians by whom he was defeated and mortally wounded the regulars as the british troops at that time were called were thrown into confusion but the provincials more used to indian fighting were not so much disconcerted they continued in an unbroken body under colonel washington and by covering the retreat of the regulars prevented their entirely being cut off notwithstanding these hostilities war had not yet been formally declared previous to the adoption of that measure greatbritain contrary to the usages of nations made prisoners of  000 french sailors this heavy blow for a long time crippled the naval operations of france but at the same time inspired her with a desire to retaliate whenever a proper opportunity should present itself for two or three years after braddocks defeat the war was carried on against france without vigor or success but when mr pitt was placed at the head of the ministry public affairs assumed a new aspect       victory every where crowned the british arms and in a short time the french were dispossessed not only of all the british territories on which they had encroached but also of quebec the capital of their ancient province canada in the course of this war some of the colonies made exertions so far beyond their reasonable quota as to merit a reimbursement from the national treasury but this was not universally the case in consequence of internal disputes together with their greater domestic security the necessary supplies had not been raised in due time by others of the provincial assemblies that a british minister should depend on colony legislatures for the execution of his plans did not well accord with the vigorous and decisive genius of mr pitt but it    was not prudent by any innovation to irritate the colonies during a war in which from local circumstances their exertions were peculiarly beneficial the advantages that would result from an ability to draw forth the resources of the colonies by the same authority which commanded the wealth of the mother country might in these circumstances  0 have suggested the idea of taxing the colonies by authority of the british parliament mr pitt is said to have told mr franklin that when the war closed if he should be in the ministry he would take measures to prevent the colonies from having a power to refuse or delay the supplies that might be wanted for national purposes but did not mention what those measures should be as often as money or men were wanted from the colonies a requisition was made to their legislatures these were generally and cheerfully complied with their exertions with a few exceptions were great and manifested a serious desire to carry into effect the plans of greatbritain for reducing the power of france in the prosecution of this war the advantages which greatbritain derived from the colonies were severely felt by her enemies upwards of  00 privateers which were fitted out of the ports of the british colonies successfully cruised on french property these not only ravaged the westindia islands belonging to his most christian majesty but made many captures on the coast of france besides distressing the french nation by privateering the colonies furnished    00 men to cooperate with the british regular forces in northamerica they also sent powerful aids both in men and provisions out of their own limits which facilitated the reduction of martinique and of the havannah the success of their privateers—the cooperation of their land forces—the convenience of their harbours and their contiguity to the westindia islands made the colonies great acquisitions to britain and formidable adversaries to france from their growing importance the latter had much to fear their continued union with greatbritain threatened the subversion of the commerce and american possessions of france      after hostilities had raged nearly eight years—a general peace was concluded on terms by which france ceded canada to greatbritain the spaniards having also taken part in the war were at the termination of it induced to relinquish to the same power both    east and westflorida this peace gave greatbritain possession    of an extent of country equal in dimensions to several of the kingdoms of europe the possession of canada in the north and of the two floridas in the south made her almost sole mistress of the northamerican continent this laid a foundation for future greatness which excited the envy and the fears of europe her navy her commerce and her manufactures had greatly increased when she held but a part of the continent and when she was bounded by the formidable powers of france and spain her probable future greatness when without a rival and with a growing vent for her manufactures and increasing employment for her marine threatened to destroy that balance of power which european sovereigns have for a long time endeavored to preserve kings are republicans with respect to each other and behold with democratic jealousy any one of their order towering above the rest the aggrandizement of one tends to excite the combination or at least the wishes of many to reduce him to the common level from motives of this kind a great part of europe not long since combined against venice and soon after against louis the xivth of france with the same suspicious eye was the naval superiority of greatbritain viewed by her neighbours they were in general disposed to favour any convulsion which promised a diminution of her overgrown power the addition to the british empire of new provinces equal in extent to old kingdoms not only excited the jealousy of european powers but occasioned doubts in the minds of enlightened british politicians whether or not such immense acquisitions of territory would contribute to the felicity of the parent state they saw or thought they saw the seeds of disunion planted in the too widely extended empire power like all things human has its limits and there is a point beyond which the longest and sharpest sword fails of doing execution to combine in one uniform system of government the extensive territory then subjected to the british sway appeared to men of reflection a work of doubtful practicability    nor were they mistaken in their conjectures the seeds of discord were soon planted and speedily grew up to the rending of the empire the high notions of liberty and independence  0 which were nurtured in the colonies by their local situation and the state of society in the new world were increased by the removal of hostile neighbours the events of the war had also given them some experience in military operations and some confidence in their own ability foreseeing their future importance from the rapid increase of their numbers and extension of their commerce and being extremely jealous of their rights they readily admitted and with pleasure indulged ideas and sentiments which were favourable to independence while combustible materials were daily collecting in the new world a spark to kindle the whole was produced in the old nor were there wanting those who from a jealousy of greatbritain helped to fan the flame    history of the american revolution  chapter ii fpage   lpage   chapter ii the origin of the disputes between greatbritain and her colonies in the year      and its progress till      from the first settlement of english america till the close of the war of      the conduct of greatbritain towards her colonies affords an useful lesson to those who are disposed to colonisation from that era it is equally worthy of the attention of those who wish for the reduction of great empires to small ones in the first period greatbritain regarded the provinces as instruments of commerce without charging herself with the care of their internal police or seeking a revenue from them she contented herself with a monopoly of their trade she treated them as a judicious mother does her dutiful children    0  they shared in every privilege belonging to her native sons and but slightly felt the inconveniences of subordination small was the catalogue of grievances with which even democratical jealousy charged the parent state antecedent to the period before       mentioned the following appear to have been the chief an act of the british parliament for prohibiting the cutting down pitch and tar trees not being within a fence or enclosure and sundry acts which operated against colonial manufactures by one of these it was made illegal after the   th of june    0 to erect in the colonies any mill or other engine for slitting or rolling of iron or any plating forge to work with a tilthammer or any furnace for making steel by another hatters were restrained from taking more than two apprentices at a time or any for less than seven years and from employing negroes in the business the colonists were also prohibited from transporting hats and home manufactured woolens from one province to another these regulations were for the most part evaded but if carried into execution would have been slightly inconvenient and only to a few the articles the manufacturing of which were thus prohibited could be purchased at a cheaper rate from england and the hands who made them could be as well employed in agriculture      though these restrictions were a species of affront by their implying that the colonists had not sense enough to discover their own interest and though they seemed calculated to crush their native talents and to keep them in a constant state of inferiority without any hope of arriving at those advantages to which by the native riches of their country they were prompted to aspire yet if no other grievances had been superadded to what existed in      these would have been soon forgotten for their pressure was neither great nor universal the good resulting to the colonies from their connection with greatbritain infinitely outweighed the evil      till the year      the colonial regulations seemed to have no other object but the common good of the whole empire exceptions to the contrary were few and had no appearance of system when the approach of the colonies to manhood made them more capable of resisting impositions greatbritain changed the ancient system under which her colonies had long flourished when policy would rather have dictated a relaxation of authority she rose in her demands and multiplied her restraints    from the conquest of canada in      some have supposed that france began secretly to lay schemes for wresting those colonies    from greatbritain which she was not able to conquer others alledge that from that period the colonists released from all fears of dangerous neighbours fixed their eyes on independence and took sundry steps preparatory to the adoption of the measure without recurring to either of these opinions the known selfishness of human nature is sufficient to account for that demand on the one side and that refusal on the other which occasioned the revolution it was natural for greatbritain to wish for an extension of her authority over the colonies and equally so for them on their approach to maturity to be more impatient of subordination and to resist every innovation for increasing the degree of their dependence the sad story of colonial oppression commenced in the year      greatbritain then adopted new regulations respecting her colonies which after disturbing the ancient harmony of the two countries for about twelve years terminated in a dismemberment of the empire      these consisted in restricting their former commerce but more especially in subjecting them to taxation by the british parliament by adhering to the spirit of her navigation act in the course of a century the trade of greatbritain had encreased far beyond the expectation of her most sanguine sons but by rigidly enforcing the strict letter of the same in a different situation of public affairs effects directly the reverse were produced from the enterprising commercial spirit of the colonists the trade of america after filling all its proper channels to the brim swelled out on every side overflowed its proper banks with a rich redundance in the cure of evils which are closely connected with the causes of national prosperity vulgar precaution ought not to be employed in severely checking a contraband trade which was only the overflowing of an extensive fair trade the remedy was worse then the disease for some time before and after the termination of the war of      a considerable intercourse had been carried    on between the british and spanish colonies consisting of the manufactures of great britain imported by the former and sold to the latter by which the british colonies acquired gold and silver and were enabled to make remittances to the mother country this trade though it did not clash with the spirit of the british navigation laws was forbidden by their letter on account of the advantages which all parties and    particularly greatbritain reaped from this intercourse it had long been winked at by persons in power but at the period beforementioned some new regulations were adopted by which it was almost destroyed this was effected by armed cutters whose commanders were enjoined to take the usual customhouse oaths and to act in the capacity of revenue officers so sudden a stoppage of an accustomed and beneficial commerce by an unusually rigid execution of old laws was a serious blow to the northern colonies it was their misfortune that though they stood in need of vast quantities of british manufactures their country produced very little that afforded a direct remittance to pay for them they were therefore under a necessity of seeking elsewhere a market for their produce and by a circuitous route acquiring the means of supporting their credit with the mother country this they found by trading with the spanish and french colonies in their neighbourhood from them they acquired gold silver and valuable commodities the ultimate profits of which centered in greatbritain this intercourse gave life to business of every denomination and established a reciprocal circulation of money and merchandize to the benefit of all parties concerned why a trade essential to the colonies and which so far from being detrimental was indirectly advantageous to greatbritain should be so narrowly watched and so severely restrained could not be accounted for by the americans without supposing that the rulers of greatbritain were jealous of their adventurous commercial spirit and of their increasing number of seamen their actual sufferings were great but their apprehensions were greater       instead of viewing the parent state as formerly in the light of an affectionate    mother they conceived her as beginning to be influenced by the narrow views of an illiberal stepdame after the   th of september      the trade between the british and the french and spanish colonies was in some degree legalised but under circumstances that brought no relief to the colonists for it was loaded with such enormous duties as were equivalent to a prohibition the preamble to the act for this purpose was alarming whereas it is just and necessary that a revenue be raised in america for defraying the expences of defending protecting and securing the same we the commons c towards raising the same give and    grant unto your majesty the sum of here followed a specification of duties upon foreign clayed sugar indigo and coffee of foreign produce upon all wines except french upon all wrought silk and all calicoes and upon every gallon of melasses and syrups being the produce of a colony not under the dominion of his majesty it was also enacted that the monies arising from the importation of these articles into the colonies should be paid into the receipt of his majestys exchequer there to be entered separate and reserved to be disposed of by parliament toward defraying the necessary expences of defending protecting and securing america till that act passed no act avowedly for the purpose of revenue and with the ordinary title and recital of such was to be found in the parliamentary statute book the wording of it made the colonists fear that the parliament would go on in charging them with such taxes as they pleased and for the support of such military force as they should think proper the act was the more disgusting because the monies arising from it were ordered to be paid in specie and regulations were adopted against colonial paper money to obstruct the avenues of acquiring gold and silver and at the same time to interdict the use of paper money appeared to the colonists as a farther evidence that their interests were either misunderstood or disregarded the imposition of duties for the purpose of raising a revenue in america was considered as a dangerous innovation but the methods adopted for securing their collection    were resented as arbitrary and unconstitutional it was enacted by parliament that whenever offences should be committed against the acts which imposed them the prosecutor might bring his action for the penalty in the courts of admiralty by which means the defendant lost the advantage of being tried by a jury and was subjected to the necessity of having his case decided upon by a single man a creature of the crown whose salary was to be paid out of forfeitures adjudged by himself and also according to a course of law which exempted the prosecutor from the trouble of proving his accusation and obliged the defendant either to evince his innocence or to suffer by these regulations the guards which the constitution had placed round property and the fences which the ancestors of both countries had erected against arbitrary power were thrown down as far as they concerned the    colonists charged with violating the laws for raising a revenue in america they who directed public affairs in greatbritain feared that if the collection of these duties was enforced only in the customary way payment would be often eluded to obviate that disposition which the colonists discovered to screen one another in disobeying offensive acts of parliament regulations were adopted bearing hard on their constitutional rights unwilling as the colonists were to be excluded by the imposition of enormous duties from an accustomed and beneficial line of business it is not wonderful that they were disposed to represent these innovations of the mother country in the most unfavourable point of view the heavy losses to which many individuals were subjected and the general distress of the mercantile interest in several of the oldest colonies soured the minds of many that the mother country should infringe her own constitution to cramp the commerce of her colonies was a fruitful subject of declamation but these murmurings would have evaporated in words had greatbritain proceeded to no farther innovations instead of this she adopted the novel idea of raising from the colonies an efficient revenue by direct internal taxes laid by authority of her parliament    though all the colonists disrelished and many from the pressure of actual sufferings complained of the british restrictions on their manufactures and commerce yet a great majority was disposed to submit to both most of them acknowledged that the exercise of these powers was incident to the sovereignty of the mother country especially when guarded by an implied contract that they were to be only used for the common benefit of the empire it was generally allowed that as the planting of colonies was not designed to erect an independent government but to extend an old one the parent state had a right to restrain their trade in every way which conduced to the common emolument they for the most part considered the mother country as authorised to name ports and nations to which alone their merchandize should be carried and with which alone they should trade but the novel claim of taxing them without their consent was universally reprobated as contrary to their natural chartered and constitutional    rights in opposition to it they not only alledged the general principles of liberty but ancient usage during the first   0 years of their existence they had been left to tax themselves and in their own way if there were any exceptions to this general rule they were too inconsiderable to merit notice in the war of      the events of which were fresh in the recollection of every one the parliament had in no instance attempted to raise either men or money in the colonies by its own authority as the claim of taxation on one side and the refusal of it on the other was the very hinge on which the revolution turned it merits a particular discussion colonies were formerly planted by warlike nations to keep their enemies in awe to give vent to a surplus of inhabitants or to discharge a number of discontented and troublesome citizens but in modern ages the spirit of violence being in some measure sheathed in commerce colonies have been settled by the nations of europe for the purposes of trade these were to be attained by their raising for the mother country such    commodities as she did not produce and supplying themselves from her with such things as they wanted in subserviency to these views greatbritain planted colonies and made laws obliging them to carry to her all their products which she wanted and all their raw materials which she chose to work up besides this restriction she forbad them to procure manufactures from any other part of the globe or even the products of european countries which could rival her without being first brought to her ports by a variety of laws she regulated their trade in such a manner as was thought most conducive to their mutual advantage and her own particular welfare this principle of commercial monopoly ran through no less than    acts of parliament from    0 to      in all these acts the system of commerce was established as that from which alone their contributions to the strength of the empire were expected during this whole period a parliamentary revenue was no part of the object of colonisation accordingly in all the laws which regarded them the technical words of revenue laws were avoided such have usually a title purporting their being grants and the words give and grant usually precede their enacting clauses although duties were imposed on america by previous acts of parliament no one title of giving an aid to his    majesty or any other of the usual titles to revenue acts was to be found in any of them they were intended as regulations of trade and not as sources of national supplies till the year      all stood on commercial regulation and restraint while greatbritain attended to this first system of colonisation her american settlements though exposed in unknown climates and unexplored wildernesses grew and flourished and in the same proportion the trade and riches of the mother country encreased some estimate may be made of this increase from the following statement the whole export trade of england including that to the colonies in the year   0  amounted to £  0 000 sterling but so immensely had the colonies increased that the exports to them alone  0 in the year      amounted to £ 0      sterling and they were yearly increasing in the short space of    years the colonies added nearly as much to the export commerce of greatbritain as she had grown to by a progressive increase of improvement in   00 years and this increase of colonial trade was not at the expence of the general trade of the kingdom for that increased in the same time from six millions to sixteen millions in this auspicious period the mother country contented herself with exercising her supremacy in superintending the general concerns of the colonies and in harmonising the commercial interest of the whole empire to this the most of them bowed down with such a filial submission as demonstrated that they though not subjected to parliamentary taxes could be kept in due subordination and in perfect subserviency to the grand views of colonisation immediately after the peace of paris      a new scene was opened the national debt of greatbritain then amounted to     millions for which an interest of nearly   millions was annually paid while the british minister was digesting plans for diminishing this amazing load of debt he conceived the idea of raising a substantial revenue in the british colonies from taxes laid by the parliament of the parent state on the one hand it was urged that the late war originated on account of the colonies—that it was reasonable more especially as it had terminated in a manner so favourable to their interest that they should contribute to the defraying of the expences it had occasioned thus far both parties were agreed but greatbritain    contended that her parliament as the supreme power was constitutionally vested with an authority to lay them on every part of the empire this doctrine plausible in itself and conformable to the letter of the british constitution when the whole dominions were represented in one assembly was reprobated in the colonies as contrary to the spirit of the same government when the empire became so far extended as to have many distinct representative assemblies the colonists believed that the chief excellence of the    british constitution consisted in the right of subjects to grant or withhold taxes and in their having a share in enacting the laws by which they were to be bound they conceived that the superiority of the british constitution to other forms of government was not because their supreme council was called parliament but because the people had a share in it by appointing members who constituted one of its constituent branches and without whose concurrence no law binding on them could be enacted in the mother country it was asserted to be essential to the unity of the empire that the british parliament should have a right of taxation over every part of the royal dominions in the colonies it was believed that taxation and representation were inseparable and that they could neither be free nor happy if their property could be taken from them without their consent the common people in america reasoned on this subject in a summary way if a british parliament said they in which we are unrepresented and over which we have no control can take from us any part of our property by direct taxation they may take as much as they please and we have no security for any thing that remains but a forbearance on their part less likely to be exercised in our favour as they lighten themselves of the burthens of government in the same proportion that they impose them on us they well knew that communities of mankind as well as individuals have a strong propensity to impose on others when they can do it with impunity and especially when there is a prospect that the imposition will be attended with advantage to themselves the americans from that jealousy of their liberties which their local situation nurtured and which they inherited from their forefathers viewed the exclusive right of laying taxes on themselves free from extraneous influence  0 in the same light as the british parliament views its peculiar privilege of raising money independent of the crown the parent state appeared to the colonists to stand in the same relation to their local legislatures as the monarch of greatbritain to the british    parliament his prerogative is limited by that palladium of the peoples liberty the exclusive privilege of granting their own money while this right rests in the hands of the people their liberties are secured in the same manner reasoned the colonists in order to be stiled freemen our local assemblies elected by ourselves must enjoy the exclusive privilege of imposing taxes upon us they contended that men settled in foreign parts to better their condition and not to submit their liberties—to continue the equals not to become the slave of their less adventurous fellowcitizens and that by the novel doctrine of parliamentary power they were degraded from being the subjects of a king to the low condition of being subjects of subjects they argued that it was essentially involved in the idea of property that the possessor had such a right therein that it was a contradiction to suppose any other man or body of men possessed a right to take it from him without his consent precedents in the history of england justified this mode of reasoning the love of property strengthened it and it had a peculiar force on the minds of colonists  000 miles removed from the seat of government and growing up to maturity in a new world where from the extent of country and the state of society even the necessary restraints of civil government were impatiently born on the other hand the people of greatbritain revolted against the claims of the colonists educated in habits of submission to parliamentary taxation they conceived it to be the height of contumacy for their colonists to refuse obedience to the power which they had been taught to revere not adverting to the common interest which existed between the people of greatbritain and their representatives they believed that the same right existed although the same community of interests was wanting the pride of an opulent conquering nation aided this mode of reasoning what said they shall we who have so lately humbled france and spain be dictated to by our own colonists shall our subjects educated by our care and defended by our arms presume to question the rights of parliament to which we are obliged to submit       reflections of this kind congenial to the natural vanity of the human heart operated so extensively that the people of greatbritain spoke of their colonies and of their colonists as of a kind of possession annexed to their persons the love of power and of property on the one side of the atlantic were opposed by the same powerful passions on the other the disposition to tax the colonies was also strengthened by exaggerated accounts of their wealth it was said that the american planters lived in affluence and with inconsiderable taxes while the inhabitants of greatbritain were born down by such oppressive burdens as to make a bare subsistence a matter of extreme difficulty the officers who have served in america during the late war contributed to this delusion their observations were founded on what they had seen in cities and at a time when large sums were spent by government in support of fleets and armies and when american commodities were in great demand to treat with attention those who came to fight for them and also to gratify their own pride the colonists had made a parade of their riches by frequently and sumptuously entertaining the gentlemen of the british army these judging from what they saw without considering the general state of the country concurred in representing the colonists as very able to contribute largely towards defraying the common expences of the empire the charters which were supposed to contain the principles on which the colonies were founded became the subject of serious investigation on both sides one clause was found to run through the whole of them except that which had been granted to mr penn this was a declaration that the emigrants to america should enjoy the same privileges as if they had remained or had been born within the realm but such was the subtilty of disputants that both parties construed this general principle so as to favour their respective opinions the american patriots contended that as english freeholders could not be taxed but by representatives in chusing whom they had a vote neither could the colonists but    it was replied that if the colonists had remained in england they must have been bound to pay the taxes imposed by parliament it was therefore inferred that though taxed by that authority they lost none of the    rights of native englishmen residing at home the partizans of the mother country could see nothing in charters but security against taxes by royal authority the americans adhering to the spirit more than to the letter viewed their charters as a shield against all taxes not imposed by representatives of their own choice this construction they contended to be expressly recognized by the charter of maryland in that king charles bound both himself and his successors not to assent to any bill subjecting the inhabitants to internal taxation by external legislation the nature and extent of the connection between greatbritain and america was a great constitutional question involving many interests and the general principles of civil liberty to decide this recourse was in vain had to parchment authorities made at a distant time when neither the grantor nor grantees of american territory had in contemplation any thing like the present state of the two countries great and flourishing colonies daily increasing in numbers and already grown to the magnitude of a nation planted at an immense distance and governed by constitutions resembling that of the country from which they sprung were novelties in the history of the world to combine colonies so circumstanced in one uniform system of government with the parent state required a great knowledge of mankind and an extensive comprehension of things it was an arduous business far beyond the grasp of ordinary statesmen whose minds were narrowed by the formalities of law or the trammels of office an original genius unfettered with precedents and exalted with just ideas of the rights of human nature and the obligations of universal benevolence might have struck out a middle line which would have secured as much liberty to the colonies and as great a degree of supremacy to the parent state as their common good required but    the helm of greatbritain was not in such hands the spirit of the british constitution on the one hand revolted at the idea that the british parliament should exercise the same unlimited authority over the unrepresented colonies which it exercised over the inhabitants of greatbritain the colonists on the other hand did not claim a total exemption from its authority they in general allowed the mother country a certain undefined prerogative    over them and acquiesced in the right of parliament to make many acts binding them in many subjects of internal policy and regulating their trade where parliamentary supremacy ended and at what point colonial independency began was not ascertained happy would it have been had the question never been agitated but much more so had it been compromised by an amicable compact without the horrors of a civil war the english colonies were originally established not for the sake of revenue but on the principles of a commercial monopoly while england pursued trade and forgot revenue her commerce increased at least fourfold the colonies took off the manufactures of greatbritain and paid for them with provisions or raw materials they united their arms in war their commerce and their councils in peace without nicely investigating the terms on which the connection of the two countries depended a perfect calm in the political world is not long to be expected the reciprocal happiness both of greatbritain and of the colonies was too great to be of long duration the calamities of the war of      had scarcely ended when the germ of another war was planted which soon grew up and produced deadly fruit      at that time sundry resolutions passed the british parliament relative to the imposition of a stamp duty in america which gave a general alarm by them the right the equity the policy and even the necessity of taxing the colonies was formally avowed these resolutions being considered as the preface of a system of american revenue were deemed an introduction of evils of much greater magnitude they opened a prospect of oppression    boundless in extent and endless in duration they were nevertheless not immediately followed by any legislative act time and an invitation were given to the americans to suggest any other mode of taxation that might be equivalent in its produce to the stamp act but they objected not only to the mode but the principle and several of their assemblies though in vain petitioned against it an american revenue was in england a very popular measure the cry in favour of it was so strong as to confound and silence the voice of petitions to the contrary the equity of compelling the americans to contribute to the common expences of the empire satisfied many who without    enquiring into the policy or justice of taxing their unrepresented fellow subjects readily assented to the measures adopted by the parliament for this purpose the prospect of easing their own burdens at the expence of the colonists dazzled the eyes of gentlemen of landed interest so as to keep out of their view the probable consequences of the innovation the omnipotence of parliament was so familiar a phrase on both sides of the atlantic that few in america and still fewer in greatbritain were impressed in the first instance with any idea of the illegality of taxing the colonists the illumination on that subject was gradual the resolutions in favour of an american stamp act which passed in march      met with no opposition in the course of the year which intervened between these resolutions and the passing of a law grounded upon them the subject was better understood and constitutional objections against the measure were urged by several both in greatbritain and america this astonished and chagrined the british ministry but as the principle of taxing america had been for some time determined upon they were unwilling to give it up march       impelled by partiality for a long cherished idea mr grenville brought into the house of commons his long expected bill for laying a stamp duty in america by this after passing through the usual forms it was enacted that the instruments    of writing which are in daily use among a commercial people should be null and void unless they were executed on stamped paper or parchment charged with a duty imposed by the british parliament when the bill was brought in mr charles townsend concluded a speech in its favour with words to the following effect and now will these americans children planted by our care nourished up by our indulgence till they are grown to a degree of strength and opulence and protected by our arms will they grudge to contribute their mite to relieve us from the heavy weight of that burden which we lie under to which colonel barré replied they planted by your care no your oppressions planted them in america they fled from tyranny to a then uncultivated and inhospitable country where they exposed themselves to almost all the hardships to    which human nature is liable and among others to the cruelty of a savage foe the most subtle and i will take upon me to say the most formidable of any people upon the face of gods earth and yet actuated by principles of true english liberty they met all hardships with pleasure compared with those they suffered in their own country from the hands of those that should have been their friends they nourished up by your indulgence they grew by your neglect of them as soon as you began to care about them that care was exercised in sending persons to rule them in one department and another who were perhaps the deputies of deputies to some members of this house sent to spy out their liberties to misrepresent their actions and to prey upon them men whose behaviour on many occasions has caused the blood of those sons of liberty to recoil within them men promoted to the highest seats of justice some who to my knowledge were glad by going to a foreign country to escape being brought to the bar of a court of justice in their own they protected by your arms they have nobly taken up arms in your defence have exerted a valour amidst their constant and laborious industry for the defence of a country whose frontier was drenched in blood while its interior parts yielded all its little savings to your emolument and believe    me remember i this day told you so that same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at first will accompany them still but prudence forbids me to explain myself farther god knows i do not at this time speak from any motives of party heat what i deliver are the genuine sentiments of my heart however superior to me in general knowledge and experience the respectable body of this house may be yet i claim to know more of america than most of you having seen and been conversant in that country the people i believe are as truly loyal as any subjects the king has but a people jealous of their liberties and who will vindicate them if ever they should be violated but the subject is too delicate—i will say no more during the debate on the bill the supporters of it insisted much on the colonies being virtually represented in the same manner as leeds halifax and some other towns were a recurrence to this plea was a virtual acknowledgment that there ought not to be taxation without representation it was replied that the connexion between the electors and nonelectors of parliament in greatbritain was so interwoven from both being equally liable to pay the same common tax as to give some security of property to the latter but with    respect to taxes laid by the british parliament and paid by the americans the situation of the parties was reversed instead of both parties bearing a proportionable share of the same common burden what was laid on the one was exactly so much taken off from the other the bill met with no opposition in the house of lords and on the   d of march it received the royal assent       the night after it passed dr franklin wrote to mr charles thomson the sun of liberty is set you must light up the candles of industry and economy mr thomson answered he was apprehensive that other lights would be the consequence and foretold the opposition that shortly took place on its being suggested from authority that the stamp officers would not be sent from greatbritain but selected from among the americans the colony agents were desired to point out proper persons    for the purpose they generally nominated their friends which affords a presumptive proof that they supposed the act would have gone down in this opinion they were far from being singular that the colonists would be ultimately obliged to submit to the stamp act was at first commonly believed both in england and america the framers of it in particular flattered themselves that the confusion which would arise upon the disuse of writings and the insecurity of property which would result from using any other than that required by law would compel the colonies however reluctant to use the stamp paper and consequently to pay the taxes imposed thereon they therefore boasted that it was a law which would execute itself       by the terms of the stamp act it was not to take effect till the first day of november a period of more than seven months after its passing this give the colonists an opportunity for leisurely canvassing the new subject and examining it fully on every side in the first part of this interval struck with astonishment they lay in silent consternation and could not determine what course to pursue by degrees they recovered their recollection may          virginia led the way in opposition to the stamp act mr patrick henry brought into the house of burgesses of that colony the following resolutions which were substantially adopted resolved that the first adventurers settlers of this his majestys colony and dominion of virginia brought with them and transmitted to    their posterity and all other his majestys subjects since inhabiting in this his majestys said colony all the liberties privileges and immunities that have at any time been held enjoyed and possessed by the people of greatbritain resolved that by two royal charters granted by king james the first the colonies aforesaid are declared and entitled to all liberties privileges and immunities of denizens and natural subjects to all intents and purposes as if they had been abiding and born within the realm of england      resolved that his majestys liege people of this his ancient colony have enjoyed the rights of being thus governed  0 by their own assembly in the article of taxes and internal police and that the same have never been forfeited or yielded up but have been constantly recognized by the king and people of britain resolved therefore that the general assembly of this colony together with his majesty or his substitutes have in their representative capacity the only exclusive right and power to lay taxes and imposts upon the inhabitants of this colony and that every attempt to vest such power in any other person or persons whatsoever than the general assembly aforesaid is illegal unconstitutional and unjust and hath a manifest tendency to destroy british as well as american liberty resolved that his majestys liege people the inhabitants of this colony are not bound to yield obedience to any law or ordinance whatever designed to impose any taxation whatever upon them other than the laws or ordinances of the general assembly aforesaid resolved that any person who shall by speaking or writing assert or maintain that any person or persons other than the general assembly of this colony have any right or power to impose or lay any taxation on the people here shall be deemed an enemy to this his majestys colony upon reading these resolutions the boldness and novelty of them affected one of the members to such a degree that he cried out treason treason they were nevertheless well received by the people and immediately forwarded to the other provinces they circulated extensively and gave a spring to all the discontented till they appeared most were of opinion that the act would be quietly adopted murmurs indeed were common but they seemed to be such as would soon die away the countenance of so respectable a colony as virginia confirmed the wavering and emboldened the    timid opposition to the stamp act from that period assumed a bolder face the fire of liberty blazed forth from the press some well judged publications set the rights of the colonists in a plain but strong point of view       the tongues and the pens of the well informed    citizens laboured in kindling the latent sparks of patriotism the flame spread from breast to breast till the conflagration became general in this business newengland had a principal share the inhabitants of that part of america in particular considered their obligations to the mother country for past favours to be very inconsiderable they were fully informed that their forefathers were driven by persecution to the woods of america and had there without any expence to the parent state effected a settlement on bare creation their resentment for the invasion of their accustomed right of taxation was not so much mitigated by the recollection of late favours as it was heightened by the tradition of grievous sufferings to which their ancestors by the rulers of england had been subjected the descendants of the exiled persecuted puritans of the last century opposed the stamp act with the same spirit with which their forefathers were actuated when they set themselves against the arbitrary impositions of the house of stuart the heavy burdens which the operation of the stampact would have imposed on the colonists together with the precedent it would establish of future exactions furnished the american patriots with arguments calculated as well to move the passions as to convince the judgments of their fellow colonists in great warmth they exclaimed if the parliament has a right to levy the stamp duties they may by the same authority lay on us imposts excises and other taxes without end till their rapacity is satisfied or our abilities are exhausted we cannot at future elections displace these men who so lavishly grant away our property their seats and their power are independent of us and it will rest with their generosity where to stop in transferring the expences of government from their own to our shoulders it was fortunate for the liberties of america that newspapers were the subject of a heavy stamp duty printers when uninfluenced by government have generally arranged themselves on the side of liberty nor are they less remarkable for attention to the profits of    their profession       a stamp duty which openly invaded the first    and threatened a great diminution of the last provoked their united zealous opposition they daily presented to the public original dissertations tending to prove that if the stampact was suffered to operate the liberties of america were at end and their property virtually transferred to their transatlantic fellowsubjects the writers among the americans seriously alarmed for the fate of their country came forward with essays to prove that agreeably to the british constitution taxation and representation were inseparable that the only constitutional mode of raising money from the colonists was by acts of their own legislatures that the crown possessed no farther power than that of requisition and that the parliamentary right of taxation was confined to the mother country and there originated from the natural right of man to do what he pleased with his own transferred by consent from the electors of greatbritain to those whom they chose to represent them in parliament they also insisted much on the misapplication of public money by the british ministry great pains were taken to inform the colonists of the large sums annually bestowed on pensioned favorites and for the various purposes of bribery their passions were inflamed by high coloured representations of the hardship of being obliged to pay the earnings of their industry into a british treasury well known to be a fund for corruption the writers on the american side were opposed by arguments drawn from the unity of the empire the necessity of one supreme head the unlimited power of parliament and the great numbers in the mother country who though legally disqualified from voting at elections were nevertheless bound to pay the taxes imposed by the representatives of the nation to these objections it was replied that the very idea of subordination of parts excluded the notion of simple undivided unity       that as england was the head she could not be the head and the members too—that in all extensive empires where the dead uniformity of servitude did not prevent the subordinate parts had many local privileges and immunities—that between these privileges and the supreme    common authority the line was extremely nice but nevertheless the supremacy of the head had an ample field of exercise without arrogating to itself the disposal of  0 the property of the unrepresented subordinate parts to the assertion that the power of parliament was unlimited the colonists replied that before it could constitutionally exercise that power it must be constitutionally formed and that therefore it must at least in one of its branches be constituted by the people over whom it exercised unlimited power that with respect to greatbritain it was so constituted—with respect to america it was not they therefore inferred that its power ought not to be the same over both countries they argued also that the delegation of the people was the source of power in regard to taxation and as that delegation was wanting in america they concluded the right of parliament to grant away their property could not exist that the defective representation in greatbritain should be urged as an argument for taxing the americans without any representation at all proved the encroaching nature of power instead of convincing the colonists of the propriety of their submission it demonstrated the wisdom of their resistance for said they one invasion of natural right is made the justification of another much more injurious and oppressive the advocates for parliamentary taxation laid great stress on the rights supposed to accrue to greatbritain on the score of her having reared up and protected the english settlements in america at great expence it was on the other hand contended by the colonists that in all the wars which were common to both countries they had taken their full share but in all their own dangers in all the difficulties belonging separately to their situation which did not immediately concern greatbritain they were left to themselves and had to struggle through a hard infancy and in particular to defend themselves without any aid from the parent state against the numerous savages in their vicinity that when france had made war upon them it was not on their own account but as appendages to greatbritain       that confining their trade    for the exclusive benefit of the parent state was an ample compensation for her protection and a sufficient equivalent for their exemption from parliamentary taxation that the taxes imposed on the inhabitants of greatbritain were incorporated with their manufactures and ultimately fell on the colonists who were the consumers the advocates for the stamp act also contended that as the parliament was charged with the defence of the colonies it ought to    possess the means of defraying the expences incurred thereby the same argument had been used by king charles the  st in support of ship money and it was now answered in the same manner as it was by the patriots of that day that the people who were defended or protected were the first to judge of and to provide the means of defraying the expences incurred on that account in the mean time the minds of the americans underwent a total transformation instead of their late peaceable and steady attachment to the british nation they were dayly advancing to the opposite extreme a new mode of displaying resentment against the friends of the stamp act began in massachusetts and was followed by the other colonies      aug     a few gentlemen hung out early in the morning on the limb of a large tree towards the enterance of boston two effigies one designed for the stamp master the other for a jack boot with a head and horns peeping out at the top great numbers both from town and country came to see them a spirit of enthusiasm was diffused among the spectators in the evening the whole was cut down and carried in procession by the populace shouting liberty and property forever no stamps they next pulled down a new building lately erected by mr oliver the stamp master they then went to his house before which they beheaded his effigy and at the same time broke his windows eleven days after similar violences were repeated the mob attacked the house of mr william story deputy register of the court of admiralty—broke his windows—forced into his dwelling house and destroyed the books and files belonging to the said court and ruined a great part of his furniture they    next proceeded to the house of benjamin hallowell comptroller of the customs and repeated similar excesses and drank and destroyed his liquors they afterwards proceeded to the house of mr hutchinson and soon demolished it they carried off his plate furniture and apparel and scattered or destroyed manuscripts and other curious and useful papers which for thirty years he had been collecting about half a dozen of the meanest of the mob were soon after taken up and committed but they either broke jail or otherwise escaped all punishment the town of boston condemned the whole proceeding and for some time private gentlemen kept watch at night to prevent further violences similar disturbances broke out in the adjacent colonies nearly    about the same time       on the   th august the people of newport in rhodeisland exhibited three effigies intended for messieurs howard moffatt and johnson in a cart with halters about their necks and after hanging them on a gallows for some time cut them down and burnt them amidst the acclamations of thousands on the day following the people collected at the house of mr martin howard a lawyer who had written in defence of the right of parliament to tax the americans and demolished every thing that belonged to it they proceeded to dr moffatts who in conversation had supported the same right and made a similar devastation of his property in connecticut they exhibited effigies in sundry places and afterwards committed them to the flames nov        in newyork the stamp master having resigned the stamp papers were taken into fort george by lieutenant governor colden the people disliking his political sentiments broke open his stable took out his coach and carried it in triumph through the principal streets to the gallows on one end of this they suspended the effigy of the lieut governor having in his right hand a stamped bill of lading and in the other a figure of the devil after some time they carried the apparatus to the gate of the fort and from thence to the bowling green under the muzzles of the guns and burned the    whole amid the acclamations of many thousands they went thence to major james house stripped it of every article and consumed the whole because he was a friend to the stamp act the next evening the mob reassembled and insisted upon the lieutenant governor delivering the stamped papers into their hands and threatened in case of a refusal to take them by force after some negotiation it was agreed that they should be delivered to the corporation and they were deposited in the city hall ten boxes of the same which came by another conveyance were burned the stampact was not less odious to many of the inhabitants of the british westindia islands than to those on the continent of north america the people of st kitts obliged the stamp officer and his deputy to resign barbadoes canada and halifax submitted to the act when the ship which brought the stamp papers to philadelphia first appeared round gloucester point all the vessels in the harbour hoisted their colours half mast high the bells were rung muffled till    evening and every countenance added to the appearance of sincere mourning a large number of people assembled and endeavoured to procure the resignation of mr hughes the stamp distributor he heid out long but at length found it necessary to comply as opportunities offered the assemblies generally passed resolutions asserting their exclusive right to lay taxes on their constituents the people in their town meetings instructed their representatives to oppose the stamp act as a specimen of these the instructions given to thomas forster their representative by the freeholders and other inhabitants of the town of plymouth are subjoined in these the yeomanry of the country spoke the determined language of freemen october       after expressing the highest esteem for the british constitution and setting forth their grievances they proceeded as follows you sir represent a people who are not only descended from the first settlers of this country but inhabit the very spot they first possessed here was first laid    the foundation of the british empire in this part of america which from a very small beginning has increased and spread in a manner very surprising and almost incredible especially when we consider that all this has been effected without the aid or assistance of any power on earth that we have defended protected and secured ourselves against the invasions and cruelty of savages and the subtlety and inhumanity of our inveterate and natural enemies the french and all this without the appropriation of any tax by stamps or stamp acts laid upon our fellow subjects in any part of the kings dominions for defraying the expence thereof this place sir was at first the asylum of liberty and we hope will ever be preserved sacred to it though it was then no more than a barren wilderness inhabited only by savage men and beasts to this place our fathers whose memories be revered possessed of the principles of liberty in their purity disdaining slavery fled to enjoy those privileges which they had an undoubted right to but were deprived of by the hands of violence and oppression in their native country we sir their posterity the freeholders and other inhabitants of this town legally assembled for that purpose possessed of the same sentiments and retaining the same ardour for liberty think it our indispensable duty on this occasion to express to you these our sentiments of the stampact and its fatal consequences to this country and to enjoin upon you as you regard not only the welfare but the very being of this people that you consistent with our allegiance to the king and relation to the government    of great britain disregarding all proposals for that purpose exert all your power and influence in opposition to the stamp act at least till we hear the success of our petitions for relief we likewise to avoid disgracing the memories of our ancestors as well as the reproaches of our own consciences and the curses of posterity recommend it to you to obtain if possible in the honorable house of representatives of this province a full and explicit assertion of our rights and to have the same entered on their public records that all generations yet to come may be convinced that we have    not only a just sense of our rights and liberties but that we never with submission to divine providence will be slaves to any power on earth the expediency of calling a continental congress to be composed of deputies from each of the provinces had early occurred to the people of massachusetts      june    the assembly of that province passed a resolution in favour of that measure and fixed on newyork as the place and the second tuesday of october as the time for holding the same soon after they sent circular letters to the speakers of the several assemblies requesting their concurrence this first advance towards continental union was seconded in southcarolina before it had been agreed to by any colony to the southward of new england the example of this province had a considerable influence in recommending the measure to others who were divided in their opinions on the propriety of it the assemblies of virginia northcarolina and georgia were prevented by their governors from sending a deputation to this congress twenty eight deputies from massachusetts rhodeisland connecticut newyork newjersey pennsylvania delaware maryland and southcarolina met at newyork and after mature deliberation agreed on a declaration of their rights and on a statement of their grievances they asserted in strong terms their exemption from all taxes not imposed by their own representatives they also concurred in a petition to the king and memorial to the house of lords and a petition to the house of commons the colonies that were prevented from sending their representatives to this congress forwarded petitions similar to those which were adopted by the deputies which attended while a variety of legal and illegal methods were adopted to oppose the stamp act the first of november on which it was to commence    its operation approached this in boston was ushered in by a funeral tolling of bells many shops and stores were shut the effigies of the planners and friends of the stamp act were carried    about the streets in public derision and then torn in pieces by the enraged populace it was remarkable that though a large crowd was assembled there was not the least violence or disorder nov   at portsmouth in newhampshire the morning was ushered in with tolling all the bells in town in the course of the day notice was given to the friends of liberty to attend her funeral a coffin neatly ornamented inscribed with the word liberty in large letters was carried to the grave the funeral procession began from the state house attended with two unbraced drums while the inhabitants who followed the coffin were in motion minute guns were fired and continued till the corpse arrived at the place of interment then an oration in favour of the deceased was pronounced it was scarcely ended before the corpse was taken up it having been perceived that some remains of life were left at which the inscription was immediately altered to liberty revived the bells immediately exchanged their melancholy for a more joyful sound and satisfaction appeared in every countenance the whole was conducted with decency and without injury or insult to any mans person or property in maryland the effigy of the stamp master on one side of which was written tyranny on the other oppression and across the breast damn my country ill get money was carried through the streets from the place of confinement to the whipping post and from thence to the pillory after suffering many indignities it was first hanged and than burnt the general aversion to the stamp act was by similar methods in a variety of places demonstrated it is remarkable that the proceedings of the populace on these occasions were earned on with decorum and regularity they were not ebullitions of a thoughtless mob but for the most part planned by leading men of character and influence who were friends to peace and order these knowing well that the bulk of mankind are more led by their senses than by their reason conducted the public  0 exhibitions on that principle with a view of making the stamp act and its friends both ridiculous and odious      though the stamp act was to have operated from the first of    november yet legal proceedings in the courts were carried on as before vessels entered and departed without stamped papers the printers boldly printed and circulated their newspapers and found a sufficient number of readers though they used common paper in defiance of the act of parliament in most departments by common consent business was carried on as though no stamp act had existed this was accompanied by spirited resolutions to risque all consequences rather than submit to use the paper required by law while these matters were in agitation the colonists entered into associations against importing british manufactures till the stamp act should be repealed in this manner british liberty was made to operate against british tyranny agreeably to the free constitution of great britain the subject was at liberty to buy or not to buy as he pleased by suspending their future purchases on the repeal of the stamp act the colonists made it the interest of merchants and manufacturers to solicit for that repeal they had usually taken off so great a proportion of british manufactures that the sudden stoppage of all their orders amounting annually to several millions sterling threw some thousands in the mother country out of employment and induced them from a regard to their own interest to advocate the measures wished for by america the petitions from the colonies were seconded by petitions from the merchants and manufacturers of greatbritain what the former prayed for as a matter of right and connected with their liberties the latter also solicited from motives of immediate advantage in order to remedy the deficiency of british goods the colonists betook themselves to a variety of necessary domestic manufactures in a little time large quantities of course and common clothes were brought to market and these though dearer and of a worse quality were cheerfully preferred to similar articles imported from britain that wool might not be wanting they entered into resolutions    to abstain from eating lambs foreign elegancies were generally laid aside the women were as exemplary as the men in various instances of self denial with great readiness they refused every article of decoration for their persons and of luxury for their tables these restrictions which the colonists had voluntarily imposed on themselves were so well observed that multitudes of artificers in england were reduced to    great distress and some of their most flourishing manufactories were in a great measure at a stand an association was entered into by many of the sons of liberty the name given to those who were opposed to the stamp act by which they agreed to march with the utmost expedition at their own proper costs and expence with their whole force to the relief of those that should be in danger from the stamp act or its promoters and abettors or any thing relative to it on account of any thing that may have been done in opposition to its obtaining this was subscribed by so many in newyork and newengland that nothing but a repeal could have prevented the immediate commencement of a civil war from the decided opposition to the stamp act which had been by the colonies adopted it became necessary for great britain to enforce or to repeal it both methods of proceeding had supporters the opposers of a repeal urged arguments drawn from the dignity of the nation the danger of giving way to the clamours of the americans and the consequences of weakening parliamentary authority over the colonies on the other hand it was evident from the determined opposition of the colonies that it could not be enforced without a civil war by which in every event the nation must be a loser in the course of these discussions dr franklin was examined at the bar of the house of commons and gave extensive information on the state of american affairs and the impolicy of the stamp act which contributed much to remove prejudices and to produce a disposition that was friendly to a repeal some speakers of great weight in both houses of parliament denied their right of taxing the colonies the    most distinguished supporters of this opinion were lord camden in the house of peers and mr pitt in the house of commons the former in strong language said my position is this i repeat it i will maintain it to my last hour taxation and representation are inseparable this position is founded on the laws of nature it is more it is itself an eternal law of nature for whatever is a mans own is absolutely his own no man has a right to take it from him without his consent whoever attempts to do it attempts an injury whoever does it commits a robbery mr pitt with an original boldness of expression justified the colonists in opposing the stampact you have no    right said he to tax america i rejoice that america has resisted three millions of our fellow subjects so lost to every sense of virtue as tamely to give up their liberties would be fit instruments to make slaves of the rest he concluded with giving his advice that the stampact be repealed absolutely totally and immediately that the reason for the repeal be assigned that it was founded on an erroneous principle at the same time said he let the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies be asserted in as strong terms as can be devised and be made to extend to every point of legislation whatsoever that we may bind their trade confine their manufactures and exercise every power except that of taking their money out of their pockets without their consent the approbation of this illustrious statesman whose distinguished abilities had raised great britain to the highest pitch of renown inspired the americans with additional confidence in the rectitude of their claims of exemption from parliamentary taxation and emboldened them to farther opposition when at a future day as shall be hereafter related the project of an american revenue was resumed after much debating and two protests in the house of lords and passing an act for securing the dependence of america on great britain the repeal of the stamp act was finally carried march     this event gave great joy in london ships in the river thames displayed their colours and houses were illuminated all    over the city it was no sooner known in america than the colonists rescinded their resolutions and recommenced their mercantile intercourse with the mother country they presented their homespun clothes to the poor and imported more largely than ever the churches resounded with thanksgivings and their public and private rejoicings knew no bounds by letters addresses and other means almost all the colonies shewed unequivocal marks of acknowledgment and gratitude so sudden a calm recovered after so violent a storm is without a parallel in history by the judicious sacrifice of one law the parliament of great britain procured an acquiescence in all that remained there were enlightened patriots fully impressed with an idea that the immoderate joy of the colonists was disproportioned to the advantage they had gained the stamp act though repealed was not repealed on american    principles the preamble assigned as the reason thereof that the collecting the several duties and revenues as by the said act was directed would be attended with many inconveniencies and productive of consequences dangerous to the commercial interests of these kingdoms though this reason was a good one in england it was by no means satisfactory in america at the same time that the stamp act was repealed the absolute unlimited supremacy of parliament was in words asserted the opposers of the repeal contended for this as essential the friends of that measure acquiesced in it to strengthen their party and make sure of their object many of both sides thought that the dignity of great britain required something of the kind to counterbalance the loss of authority that might result from her yielding to the clamours of the colonists the act for this purpose was called the declaratory act and was in principle more hostile to american rights than the stamp act for it annulled those resolutions and acts of the provincial assemblies in which they had asserted their right to exemption from all taxes not imposed by their own representatives and also enacted that the parliament    had and of right ought to have power to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever  the bulk of the americans intoxicated with the advantage they had gained overlooked this statute which in one comprehensive sentence not only deprived them of liberty and property but of every right incident to humanity they considered it as a salvo for the honor of parliament in repealing an act which had so lately received their sanction and flattered themselves it would remain a dead letter and that although the right of taxation was in words retained it would never be exercised unwilling to contend about paper claims of ideal supremacy they returned to their habits of good humour with the parent state the repeal of the stamp act in a relative connexion with all its circumstances and consequences was the first direct step to american independency the claims of the two countries were not only left undecided but a foundation was laid for their extending at a future period to the impossibility of a compromise though for the present greatbritain receded from enforcing her claim of american revenue a numerous party adhering to that system reserved  0 themselves for more favourable circumstances to enforce it and at the same time the colonists more enlightened on the subject and more fully convinced of the rectitude of their claims were encouraged to oppose it under whatsoever form it should appear or under whatsoever disguise it should cover itself elevated with the advantage they had gained from that day forward instead of feeling themselves dependent on greatbritain they conceived that in respect to commerce she was dependent on them it inspired them with such high ideas of the importance of their trade that they considered the mother country to be brought under greater obligations to them for purchasing her manufactures than they were to her for protection and the administration of civil government the freemen of british america impressed with the exalting sentiments of patriotism and of liberty conceived it to be within their power by future combinations at any time to    convulse if not to bankrupt the nation from which they sprung opinions of this kind were strengthened by their local situation favouring ideas as extensive as the unexplored continent of which they were inhabitants while the pride of britons revolted at the thought of their colonies refusing subjection to that parliament which they obeyed the americans with equal haughtiness exclaimed shall the petty island of greatbritain scarce a speck on the map of the world controul the free citizens of the great continent of america these high sounding pretensions would have been harmless or at most spent themselves in words had not a ruinous policy untaught by recent experience called them into serious action though the stamp act was repealed an american revenue was still a favourite object with many in greatbritain the equity and the advantage of taxing the colonists by parliamentary authority were very apparent to their understandings but the mode of effecting it without hazarding the public tranquility was not so obvious mr charles townsend afterwards chancellor of the exchequer pawned his credit to accomplish what many so earnestly desired       he accordingly brought into parliament a bill for granting duties in the british colonies on glass paper painters colours and tea which was afterwards enacted into a law if the small duties imposed on these articles had preceded the stamp act they might have passed unobserved but the late    discussions occasioned by that act had produced among the colonists not only an animated conviction of their exemption from parliamentary taxation but a jealousy of the designs of greatbritain the sentiments of the americans on this subject bore a great resemblance to those of their british countrymen of the preceding century in the case of ship money the amount of that tax was very moderate little exceeding twenty thousand pounds it was distributed upon the people with equality and expended for the honour and advantage of the kingdom yet all these circumstances could not reconcile the people of england to the imposition    it was entirely arbitrary by the same right said they any other tax may be imposed in like manner the americans considered these small duties in the nature of an entering wedge designed to make way for others which would be greater and heavier in a relative connection with late acts of parliament respecting domestic manufactures and foreign commerce laws for imposing taxes on british commodities exported to the colonies formed a complete circle of oppression from which there was no possibility of escaping the colonists had been previously restrained from manufacturing certain articles for their own consumption other acts confined them to the exclusive use of british merchandize the addition of duties put them wholly in the power and discretion of greatbritain we are not said they permitted to import from any nation other than our own parent state and have been in some cases by her restrained from manufacturing for ourselves and she claims a right to do so in every instance which is incompatible with her interest to these restrictions we have hitherto submitted but she now rises in her demands and imposes duties on those commodities the purchasing of which elsewhere than at her market her laws forbid and the manufacturing of which for our own use she may any moment she pleases restrain if her right is valid to lay a small tax it is equally so to lay a large one for from the nature of the case she must be guided exclusively by her own opinions of our ability and of the propriety of the duties she may impose nothing is left for us but to complain and pay they contended that there was no real difference between the principle of these new duties and the stamp act they were both    designed to raise a revenue in america and in the same manner the payment of the duties imposed by the stamp act might have been eluded by the total disuse of stamped paper and so might the payment of these duties by the total disuse of those articles on which they were laid but in neither case without great difficulty the colonists were therefore reduced to the hard alternative of being obliged totally to disuse articles of the greatest necessity in human    life or to pay a tax without their consent the fire of opposition which had been smothered by the repeal of the stamp act burned afresh against the same principle of taxation exhibited in its new form mr dickenson of pennsylvania on this occasion presented to the public a series of letters signed a farmer proving the extreme danger which threatened the liberties of america from their acquiescence in a precedent which might establish the claim of parliamentary taxation they were written with great animation and were read with uncommon avidity their reasoning was so convincing that many of the candid and disinterested citizens of greatbritain acknowledged that the american opposition to parliamentary taxation was justifiable the enormous sums which the stamp act would have collected had thoroughly alarmed the colonists for their property it was now demonstrated by several writers especially by the pennsylvania farmer that a small tax though more specious was equally dangerous as it established a precedent which eventually annihilated american property the declaratory act which at first was the subject of but a few comments was now dilated upon as a foundation for every species of oppression and the small duties lately imposed were considered as the beginning of a train of much greater evils had the colonists admitted the propriety of raising a parliamentary revenue among them the erection of an american board of commissioners for managing it which was about this time instituted at boston would have been a convenience rather than an injury but united as they were in sentiments of the contrariety of that measure to their natural and constitutional rights they illy brooked the innovation as it was coeval with the new duties they considered it as a certain evidence that the project of an extensive american revenue notwithstanding the repeal of the stamp act was still in    contemplation a dislike to british taxation naturally produced a dislike to a board which was to be instrumental in that business and occasioned many insults to its commissioners    the revenue act of      produced resolves petitions addresses and remonstrances similar to those with which the colonists opposed the stamp act it also gave rise to a second association for suspending farther importations of british manufactures till these offensive duties should be taken off uniformity in these measures was promoted by a circular letter from the assembly of massachusetts to the speakers of the other assemblies       this stated the petitions and representations which they had forwarded against the late duties and strongly pointed out the great difficulties that must arise to themselves and their constituents from the operation of acts of parliament imposing duties on the unrepresented american colonies and requesting a reciprocal free communication on public affairs most of the provincial assemblies as they had opportunities of deliberating on the subject approved of the proceedings of the massachusetts assembly and harmonised with them in the measures which they had adopted in resolves they stated their rights in firm but decent language and in petitions they prayed for a repeal of the late acts which they considered as infringements on their liberties it is not unreasonable to suppose that the minister who planned these duties hoped that they would be regarded as regulations of trade he might also presume that as they amounted only to an inconsiderable sum they would not give any alarm the circular letter of the massachusetts assembly which laid the foundation for united petitions against them gave therefore great offence lord hillsborough who had lately been appointed secretary of state for the american department wrote letters to the governors of the respective provinces urging them to exert their influence to prevent the assemblies from taking any notice of it and he called on the massachusetts assembly to rescind their proceedings on that subject this measure was both injudicious and irritating to require a public body to rescind a resolution for sending a letter which was already sent answered and acted upon was a bad specimen of the wisdom of the new minister to call a vote for sending a circular    letter    to invite the assemblies of the neighbouring colonies to communicate together in the pursuit of legal measures to obtain a redress of grievances a flagitious attempt to disturb the public peace appeared to the colonists a very injudicious application of harsh epithets to their constitutional right of petitioning to threaten a new house of assembly with dissolution in case of their not agreeing to rescind an act of a former assembly which was not executory but executed clashed no less with the dictates of common sense than the constitutional rights of british colonists the proposition for rescinding was negatived by a majority of    to    the assembly was immediately dissolved as had been threatened this procedure of the new secretary was considered by the colonists as an attempt to suppress all communication of sentiments between them and to prevent their united supplications from reaching the royal ear it answered no one valuable purpose but naturally tended to mischief the bad humour which from successive irritation already too much prevailed was about this time wrought up to a high pitch of resentment and violence on occasion of the seizure of mr hancocks sloop liberty for not having entered all the wines she had brought from madeira      june  0  the popularity of her owner the name of the sloop and the general aversion to the board of commissioners and parliamentary taxation concurred to inflame the minds of the people they resented the removal of the sloop from the wharf as implying an apprehension of a rescue they used every means in their power to interrupt the officers in the execution of their business and numbers swore that they would be revenged mr harrison the collector mr hallowell the comptroller and mr irwine the inspector of imports and exports were so roughly handled as to bring their lives in danger the windows of some of their houses were broken and the boat of the collector was dragged through the town and burned on the common such was the temper and disposition of many of the inhabitants that the commissioners of the customs thought  0 proper to retire on board the romney man of war and afterwards to castle william the commissioners from the first moment of their institution had been an eye sore to the people of boston this though partly owing to their active zeal in detecting smugglers principally arose from the association which existed in    the minds of the inhabitants between that board and an american revenue the declaratory act of      the revenue act of      together with the pomp and expence of this board so disproportionate to the small income of the present duties conspired to convince not only the few who were benefited by smuggling but the great body of enlightened freemen that farther and greater impositions of parliamentary taxes were intended in proportion as this opinion gained ground the inhabitants became more disrespectful to the executive officers of the revenue and more disposed in the frenzy of patriotism to commit outrages on their persons and property the constant bickering that existed between them and the inhabitants together with the steady opposition given by the latter to the discharge of the official duties of the former induced the commissioners and friends of an american revenue to solicit the protection of a regular force to be stationed at boston in compliance with their wishes his majesty ordered two regiments and some armed vessels to repair thither for supporting and assisting the officers of the customs in the execution of their duty this restrained the active exertion of that turbulent spirit which since the passing of the late revenue laws had revived but it added to the preexisting causes thereof when it was reported in boston that one or more regiments were ordered there a meeting of the inhabitants was called and a committee appointed to request the governor to issue precepts for convening a general assembly he replied that he could not comply with their request till he had received his majestys commands for that purpose this answer being reported some spirited resolutions were adopted sept     in particular it was voted that the select men of boston should write    to the select men of other towns to propose that a convention be held of deputies from each to meet at faneuil hall in boston on the   d instant sept     it was afterwards voted that as there is apprehension in the minds of many of an approaching war with france those inhabitants who are not provided be requested to furnish themselves forthwith with arms ninety six towns and eight districts agreed to the proposal made by the inhabitants of boston and appointed deputies to attend a convention but the town of hatfield refused its concurrence when the deputies met they conducted with moderation disclaimed all    legislative authority advised the people to pay the greatest deference to government and to wait patiently for a redress of their grievances from his majestys wisdom and moderation after stating to the world the causes of their meeting and an account of their proceedings they dissolved themselves after a short session and went home within a day after the convention broke up the expected regiments arrived and were peaceably received hints had been thrown out by some idle people that they should not be permitted to come on shore preparations were made by the captains of the men of war in the harbour to fire on the town in case opposition had been made to their landing but the crisis for an appeal to arms was not yet arrived it was hoped by some that the folly and rage of the bostonians would have led them to this rash measure and thereby have afforded an opportunity for giving them some naval and military correction but both prudence and policy induced them to adopt a more temperate line of conduct while the contention was kept alive by the successive irritations which have been mentioned there was particularly in massachusetts a species of warfare carried on between the royal governors and the provincial assemblies each watched the other with all the jealousy which strong distrust could inspire the latter regarded the former as instruments of power wishing to pay their court to the mother country by curbing the spirit of    american freedom and the former kept a strict eye on the latter lest they might smooth the way to independence at which they were charged with aiming lieut governor hutchinson of massachusetts virtually challenged the assembly to a dispute on the ground of the controversy between the two countries this was accepted by the latter and the subject discussed with all the subtilty of argument which the ingenuity of either party could suggest the war of words was not confined to the colonies while the american assemblies passed resolutions asserting their exclusive right to tax their constituents the parliament by resolves asserted their unlimited supremacy in and over the colonies while the former in their public acts disclaimed all views of independence they were successively represented in parliamentary resolves royal speeches and addresses from lords and commons as being in a state of    disobedience to law and government and as having proceeded to measures subversive of the constitution and manifesting a disposition to throw off all subordination to great britain      in february      both houses of parliament went one step beyond all that had preceded they then concurred in a joint address to his majesty in which they expressed their satisfaction in the measures his majesty had pursued—gave the strongest assurances that they would effectually support him in such farther measures as might be found necessary to maintain the civil magistrates in a due execution of the laws in massachusetts bay and beseeched him to direct the governor to take the most effectual methods of procuring the fullest information touching all treasons or misprisions of treason committed within the government since the  0th day of december      and to transmit the same together with the names of the persons who were most active in the commission of such offences to one of the secretaries of state in order that his majesty might issue a special commission for enquiring of hearing and determining the said offences within the realm of greatbritain pursuant to the provision of the statute of the   th    of king henry the  th the latter part of this address which proposed the bringing of delinquents from massachusetts to be tried at a tribunal in greatbritain for crimes committed in america underwent many severe animadversions it was asserted to be totally inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution for in england a man charged with a crime had a right to be tried in the county in which his offence was supposed to have been committed justice is regularly and impartially administered in our courts said the colonists and yet by direction of parliament offenders are to be taken by force together with all such persons as may be pointed out as witnesses and carried to england there to be tried in a distant land by a jury of strangers and subject to all the disadvantages which result from want of friends want of witnesses and want of money the house of burgesses of virginia met soon after official accounts of the joint address of lords and commons on this subject reached    america and in a few days after their meeting passed resolutions expressing their exclusive right to tax their constituents and their right to petition their sovereign for redress of grievances and the lawfulness of procuring the concurrence of the other colonies in praying for the royal interposition in favour of the violated rights of america and that all trials for treason or for any crime whatsoever committed in that colony ought to be before his majestys courts within the said colony and that the seizing any person residing in the said colony suspected of any crime whatsoever committed therein and sending such person to places beyond the sea to be tried was highly derogatory of the rights of british subjects the next day lord botetourt the governour of virginia sent for the house of burgesses and addressed them as follows mr speaker and gentlemen of the house of burgesses i have heard of your resolves and augur ill of their effects you have made it my duty to dissolve you and you are dissolved accordingly    the assembly of northcarolina adopted resolutions similar to those of virginia for which tryon their governour dissolved them the members of the house of burgesses in virginia and of the assembly of northcarolina after their dissolution met as private gentlemen chose their late speakers moderators and adopted resolutions against importing british goods the nonimportation agreement was in this manner forwarded by the very measures which were intended to curb the spirit of american freedom from which it sprung meetings of the associators were regularly held in the various provinces committees were appointed to examine all vessels arriving from britain censures were freely passed on such as refused to concur in these associations and their names published in the newspapers as enemies to their country the regular acts of the provincial assemblies were not so much respected and obeyed as the decrees of these committees the associations were in general as well observed as could be expected but nevertheless there were some collusions the fear of mobs of public resentment and contempt cooperating with patriotism preponderated over private interest and convenience one of the importing merchants of boston who    hesitated in his compliance with the determination of the inhabitants was waited upon by a committee of tradesmen with an axeman and a carpenter at their head who informed him that  000 men were waiting for his answer and that if he refused to comply they could not tell what might be the consequence  he complied and the newspapers soon after published that he did it voluntarily in boston lieut governor hutchinson endeavoured to promote a counter association but without effect the friends of importation objected that till parliament made provision for the punishment of the confederacies against importation a counter association would answer no other purpose than to expose the associators to popular rage the bostonians about this time went one step farther they reshipped goods to great britain instead of    storing them as formerly this was resolved upon in a town meeting on the information of an inhabitant who communicated a letter he had lately received from a member of parliament in which it was said that shipping back ten thousand pounds worth of goods would do more than storing a hundred thousand this turned the scale and procured a majority of votes for reshipping not only in this but in many other instances the violences of the colonists were fostered by individuals in great britain a number of these were in principle with the americans in denying the right of parliament to tax them but others were more influenced by a spirit of opposition to the ministerial majority than by a regard to the constitutional liberties of either country the nonimportation agreement had now lasted some time and by degrees had become general several of the colonial assemblies had been dissolved or prorogued for asserting the rights of their constituents the royal governours and other friends to an american revenue were chagrined the colonists were irritated good men both in england and america deplored these untoward events and beheld with concern an increasing ill humour between those who were bound by interest and affection to be friends to each other in consequence of the american nonimportation agreement founded in opposition to the duties of      the manufacturers of great britain experienced a renewal of the distresses which followed  0 the adoption of similar resolutions in the year      the repeal of these duties was therefore solicited by the same influence which had procured the repeal of the stamp act the rulers of great britain acted without decision instead of persevering in their own system of coercion or indeed in any one uniform system of colonial government they struck out a middle line embarrassed with the consequences both of severity and of lenity and which was without the complete benefits of either       soon after the spirited address to his majesty last mentioned had passed both houses of parliament assurances were given for    repealing all the duties imposed in      excepting that of threepence per pound on tea anxious on the one hand to establish parliamentary supremacy and on the other afraid to stem the torrent of opposition they conceded enough to weaken the former and yet not enough to satisfy the latter had great britain generously repealed the whole and for ever relinquished all claim to the right or even the exercise of the right of taxation the union of the two countries might have lasted for ages had she seriously determined to compel the submission of the colonies nothing could have been more unfriendly to this design than her repeated concessions to their reiterated associations the declaratory act and the reservation of the duty on tea left the cause of contention between the two countries in full force but the former was only a claim on paper and the latter might be evaded by refusing to purchase any tea on which the parliamentary tax was imposed the colonists therefore conceiving that their commerce might be renewed without establishing any precedent injurious to their liberties relaxed in their associations in every particular except tea and immediately recommenced the importation of all other articles of merchandise a political calm once more took place the parent state might now have closed the dispute for ever and honorably receded without a formal relinquishment of her claims neither the reservation of the duty on tea by the british parliament nor the exceptions made by the colonists of importing no tea on which a duty was imposed would if they had been left to their own operation have disturbed the returning harmony of the two countries without fresh irritation their wounds might have healed and not a scar been left behind unfortunately for the friends of union so paltry a sum as   pence    for so insignificant an article as tea in consequence of a combination between the british ministry and eastindia company revived the dispute to the rending of the empire    these two abortive attempts to raise a parliamentary revenue in america caused a fermentation in the minds of the colonists and gave birth to many enquiries respecting their natural rights reflections and reasonings on this subject produced a high sense of liberty and a general conviction that there could be no security for their property if they were to be taxed at the discretion of a british parliament in which they were unrepresented and over which they had no controul a determination not only to oppose this new claim of taxation but to keep a strict watch least it might be established in some disguised form took possession of their minds it commonly happens in the discussion of doubtful claims between states that the ground of the original dispute insensibly changes when the mind is employed in investigating one subject others associated with it naturally present themselves in the course of enquiries on the subject of parliamentary taxation the restriction on the trade of the colonists—the necessity that was imposed on them to purchase british and other manufactures loaded with their full proportion of all taxes paid by those who made or sold them became more generally known while american writers were vindicating their country from the charge of contributing nothing to the common expences of the empire they were led to set off to their credit the disadvantage of their being confined exclusively to purchase such manufactures in britain they instituted calculations by which they demonstrated that the monopoly of their trade drew from them greater sums for the support of government than were usually paid by an equal number of their fellow citizens of greatbritain and that taxation superadded to such a monopoly would leave them in a state of perfect uncompensated slavery the investigation of these subjects brought matters into view which the friends of union ought to have kept out of sight these circumstances together with the extensive population of the eastern states and their adventurous spirit of commerce suggested to some bold spirits that not only british taxation but british navigation laws were unfriendly to the interests of    america speculations of this magnitude suited well with the extensive views of some capital    merchants but never would have roused the bulk of the people had not new matter brought the dispute between the two countries to a point in which every individual was interested on reviewing the conduct of the british ministry respecting the colonies much weakness as well as folly appears for a succession of years there was a steady pursuit of american revenue but great inconsistence in the projects for obtaining it in one moment the parliament was for enforcing their laws the next for repealing them doing and undoing menacing and submitting straining and relaxing followed each other in alternate succession the object of administration though twice relinquished as to any present efficiency was invariably pursued but without any unity of system on the  th of may      the king in his speech to parliament highly applauded their hearty concurrence in maintaining the execution of the laws in every part of his dominions five days after this speech lord hillsborough secretary of state for the colonies wrote to lord botetourt governor of virginia i can take upon me to assure you notwithstanding information to the contrary from men with factious and seditious views that his majestys present administration have at no time entertained a design to propose to parliament to lay any farther taxes upon america for the purpose of raising a revenue and that it is at present their intention to propose the next session of parliament to take off the duties upon glass paper and colours upon consideration of such duties having been laid contrary to the true principles of commerce the governor was also informed that his majesty relied upon his prudence and fidelity to make such an explanation of his majestys measures as would tend to remove prejudices and to reestablish mutual confidence and affection between the mother country and the colonies in the exact spirit of his instructions lord botetourt addressed the virginia assembly as follows it may possibly be objected that as his    majestys present administration are not immortal their successors may be inclined to attempt to undo what the present ministers shall have attempted to perform and to that objection i can give but this answer that it is my firm opinion that the plan i have stated to you will certainly take place    and that it will never be departed from and so determined am i forever to abide by it that i will be content to be declared infamous if i do not to the last hour of my life at all times in all places and upon all occasions exert every power with which i either am or ever shall be legally invested in order to obtain and maintain for the continent of america that satisfaction which i have been authorised to promise this day by the confidential servants of our gracious sovereign who to my certain knowledge rates his honor so high that he would rather part with his crown than preserve it by deceit these assurances were received with transports of joy by the virginians they viewed them as pledging his majesty for security that the late design for raising a revenue in america was abandoned and never more to be resumed the assembly of virginia in answer to lord botetourt expressed themselves thus we are sure our most gracious sovereign under whatever changes may happen in his confidential servants will remain immutable in the ways of truth and justice and that he is incapable of deceiving his faithful subjects and we esteem your lordships information not only as warranted but even sanctified by the royal word how far these solemn engagements with the americans were observed subsequent events will demonstrate in a perfect reliance on them most of the colonists returned to their ancient habits of good humour and flattered themselves that no future parliament would undertake to give or grant away their property from the royal and ministerial assurances given in favour of america in the year      and the subsequent repeal in    0 of five sixths of the duties which had been imposed in      together with the consequent renewal of the mercantile intercourse between greatbritain  0 and the colonies many hoped that the contention between the two countries was finally closed in all the provinces excepting massachusetts appearances seemed to favour that opinion many incidents operated there to the prejudice of that harmony which had begun elsewhere to return the stationing a military force among them was a fruitful source of uneasiness the royal army had been brought thither with the avowed design of enforcing submission to the mother country speeches from the throne and addresses    from both houses of parliament had taught them to look upon the inhabitants as a factious turbulent people who aimed at throwing off all subordination to greatbritain    0  they on the other hand were accustomed to look upon the soldiery as instruments of tyranny sent on purpose to dragoon them out of their liberties reciprocal insults soured the tempers and mutual injuries embittered the passions of the opposite parties besides some fiery spirits who thought it an indignity to have troops quartered among them were constantly exciting the townspeople to quarrel with the soldiers on the second of march a fray took place near mr grays ropewalk between a private soldier of the   th regiment and an inhabitant the former was supported by his comrades the latter by the rope makers till several on both sides were involved in the consequences on the  th a more dreadful scene was presented the soldiers when under arms were pressed upon insulted and pelted by a mob armed with clubs sticks and snowballs covering stones they were also dared to fire in this situation one of the soldiers who had received a blow in resentment fired at the supposed aggressor this was followed by a single discharge from six others three of the inhabitants were killed and five were dangerously wounded the town was immediately in commotion such was the temper force and number of the inhabitants that nothing but an engagement to remove the troops out of the town together with the advice of moderate men prevented the townsmen from falling on the soldiers the killed were buried in one vault and in a most respectful    manner to express the indignation of the inhabitants at the slaughter of their brethren by soldiers quartered among them in violation of their civil liberties preston the captain who commanded the party which fired on the inhabitants was committed to jail and afterwards tried the captain and six of the men were acquitted two were brought in guilty of manslaughter it appeared on the trial that the soldiers were abused insulted threatened and pelted before they fired it was also proved that only seven guns were fired by the eight prisoners these circumstances induced the jury to make a favourable verdict the result of the trial reflected great honour on john adams and josiah quincy the council for the prisoners and also on the integrity of the jury who ventured to give an upright verdict in defiance of popular opinions    the events of this tragical night sunk deep in the minds of the people and were made subservient to important purposes the anniversary of it was observed with great solemnity eloquent orators were successively employed to deliver an annual oration to preserve the rememberance of it fresh in their minds on these occasions the blessings of liberty—the horrors of slavery—the dangers of a standing army—the rights of the colonies and a variety of such topics were presented to the public view under their most pleasing and alarming forms these annual orations administered fuel to the fire of liberty and kept it burning with an incessant flame the obstacles to returning harmony which have already been mentioned were increased by making the governor and judges in massachusetts independent of the province formerly they had been paid by yearly grants from the assembly but about this time provision was made for paying their salaries by the crown this was resented as a dangerous innovation as an infraction of their charter and as destroying that balance of power which is essential to free governments that the crown should pay the salary of the chief justice was represented by the assembly as a species of bribery tending to bias his judicial determinations they made it the foundation for    impeaching mr justice oliver before the governor but he excepted to their proceedings as unconstitutional the assembly nevertheless gained two points they tendered the governor more odious to the inhabitants and increased the public respect for themselves as the counterpart of the british house of commons and as guardians of the rights of the people a personal animosity between lieut governor hutchinson and some distinguished patriots in massachusetts contributed to perpetuate a flame of discontent in that province after it had elsewhere visibly abated this was worked up in the year      to a high pitch by a singular combination of circumstances some letters had been written in the course of the dispute by governor hutchinson lieut governor oliver and others in boston to persons in power and office in england which contained a very unfavourable representation of the state of public affairs and tended to shew the necessity of coercive measures and of changing the chartered system of government to secure the obedience of the province these letters fell into the hands of dr franklin agent of the province who transmitted    them to boston the indignation and animosity which was excited on the receipt of them knew no bounds the house of assembly agreed on a petition and remonstrance to his majesty in which they charged their governor and lieut governor with being betrayers of their trusts and of the people they governed and of giving private partial and false information they also declared them enemies to the colonies and prayed for justice against them and for their speedy removal from their places jan          these charges were carried through by a majority of    to    this petition and remonstrance being transmitted to england the merits of it were discussed before his majestys privy council after a hearing before that board in which dr franklin represented the province of massachusetts the governor and lieut governor were acquitted mr wedderburne who defended the accused royal servants in the course of his pleadings inveighed against dr franklin in the severest language as the fomenter of the disputes between the two countries it    was no protection to this venerable sage that being the agent of massachusetts he conceived it his duty to inform his constituents of letters written on public affairs calculated to overturn their chartered constitution the age respectability and high literary character of the subject of mr wedderburnes philippic turned the attention of the public on the transaction the insult offered to one of their public agents and especially to one who was both the idol and ornament of his native country sunk deep in the minds of the americans that a faithful servant whom they loved and almost adored should be insulted for discharging his official duty rankled in their hearts dr franklin was also immediately dismissed from the office of deputy postmaster general which he held under the crown it was not only by his transmission of these letters that he had given offence to the british ministry but by his popular writings in favor of america two pieces of his in particular had lately attracted a large share of public attention and had an extensive influence on both sides of the atlantic the one purported to be an edict from the king of prussia for taxing the inhabitants of greatbritain as descendants of emigrants from his dominions the other was entitled rules for reducing a great empire to a small one in both of which he had exposed the claims of the mother    country and the proceedings of the british ministry with the severity of poignant satire for ten years there had now been but little intermission to the disputes between greatbritain and her colonies their respective claims had never been compromised on middle ground the calm which followed the repeal of the stamp act was in a few months disturbed by the revenue act of the year      the tranquility which followed the repeal of five sixths of that act in the year    0 was nothing more than a truce the reservation of the duty on tea made as an avowed evidence of the claims of greatbritain to tax her colonies kept alive the jealousy of the colonists while at the same time the stationing of a standing army in massachusetts—the continuance of a board of commissioners in boston—the constituting the governors and judges of that province    independent of the people were constant sources of irritation the altercations which at this period were common between the royal governors and the provincial assemblies together with numerous vindications of the claims of america made the subject familiar to the colonists the ground of the controversy was canvassed in every company the more the americans read reasoned and conversed on the subject the more were they convinced of their right to the exclusive disposal of their property this was followed by a determination to resist all encroachments on that palladium of british liberty they were as strongly convinced of their right to refuse and resist parliamentary taxation as the ruling powers of greatbritain of their right to demand and enforce their submission to it the claims of the two countries being thus irreconcilably opposed to each other the partial calm which followed the concession of parliament in    0 was liable to disturbance from every incident under such circumstances nothing less than the most guarded conduct on both sides could prevent a renewal of the controversy instead of following those prudential measures which would have kept the ground of the dispute out of sight an impolitic scheme was concerted between the british ministry and the eastindia company which placed the claims of greatbritain and of her colonies in hostile array against each other    history of the american revolution  chapter iii fpage   lpage 0  chapter iii tea is sent by the east india company to america and is refused or destroyed by the colonists boston port act c in the year      commenced a new era of the american controversy to understand this in its origin it is necessary to recur to the period when the solitary duty on tea was excepted from the partial repeal of the revenue act of      when the duties which had been laid on glass paper and painters colours were taken off a    respectable minority in parliament contended that the duty on tea should also be removed to this it was replied that as the americans denied the legality of taxing them a total repeal would be a virtual acquiescence in their claims and that in order to preserve the rights of the mother country it was necessary to retain the preamble and at least one of the taxed articles it was answered that a partial repeal would be a source of endless discontent—that the tax on tea would not defray the expences of collecting it the motion in favour    of a total repeal was thrown out by a great majority as the parliament thought fit to retain the tax on tea for an evidence of their right of taxation the americans in like manner to be consistent with themselves in denying that right discontinued the importation of that commodity while there was no attempt to introduce tea into the colonies against this declared sense of the inhabitants these opposing claims were in no danger of collision in that case the mother country might have solaced herself with her ideal rights and the colonies with their favorite opinion of a total exemption from parliamentary taxes without disturbing the public peace this mode of compromising the dispute which seemed at first designed as a salvo for the honor and consistency of both parties was by the interference of the eastindia company in combination with the british ministry completely overset the expected revenue from tea failed in consequence of the american association to import none on which a duty was charged this though partially violated in some of the colonies was well observed in others and particularly in pennsylvania where the duty was never paid on more than one chest of that commodity this proceeded as much from the spirit of gain as of patriotism the merchants found means of supplying their countrymen with tea smuggled from countries to which the power of britain did not extend they doubtless conceived themselves to be supporting the rights of their country by refusing to purchase tea from britain but they also reflected that if they could bring the same commodity to market free of duty their profits would be proportionably greater    the love of gain was not peculiar to the american merchants from the diminished exportation to the colonies the warehouses of the british eastindia company had in them about seventeen millions of pounds of tea for which a market could not readily be procured the ministry and eastindia company unwilling to lose the one the expected revenue from the sale of tea in america—the other their usual commercial profits agreed on a measure by which they supposed both would be secured the eastindia company were by law authorized to export their tea free of duties to all places whatsoever by this regulation tea though loaded with an exceptionable duty would come cheaper to  0 the colonies than before it had been made a source of revenue for the duty when taken off it when exported from greatbritain was greater than what was to be paid on its importation into the colonies confident of success in finding a market for their tea thus reduced in its price and also of collecting a duty on its importation and sale in the colonies the eastindia company freighted several ships with teas for the different colonies and appointed agents for the disposal thereof this measure united several interests in opposition to its execution the patriotism of the americans was corroborated by several auxiliary aids no ways connected with the cause of liberty the merchants in england were alarmed at the losses that must accrue to themselves from the exportations of the eastindia company and from the sales going through the hands of consignees letters were written from that country to colonial patriots urging that opposition to which they of themselves were prone the smugglers who were both numerous and powerful could not relish a scheme which by underselling them and taking a profitable branch of business out of their hands threatened a diminution of their gains the colonists were too suspicious of the designs of greatbritain to be imposed upon the cry of endangered liberty once more excited an alarm from newhampshire to georgia the first opposition    to the execution of the scheme adopted by the eastindia company began with the american merchants they saw a profitable branch of their trade likely to be lost and the benefits of it to be transferred to people in greatbritain they felt for the wound that would be inflicted on their countrys claim of exemption from parliamentary taxation but they felt with equal sensibility for the losses they would sustain by the diversion of the streams of commerce into unusual channels though the opposition originated in the selfishness of the merchants it did not end there the great body of the people from principles of the purest patriotism were brought over to second their wishes they considered the whole scheme as calculated to seduce them into an acquiescence with the views of parliament for raising an american revenue much pains were taken to enlighten the colonists on this subject and to convince them of the eminent hazard to which their liberties were exposed    the provincial patriots insisted largely on the persevering determination of the parent state to establish her claim of taxation by compelling the sale of tea in the colonies against the solemn resolutions and declared sense of the inhabitants and that at a time when the commercial intercourse of the two countries was renewed and their ancient harmony fast returning the proposed venders of the tea were represented as revenue officers employed in the collection of an unconstitutional tax imposed by greatbritain the colonists reasoned with themselves that as the duty and the price of the commodity were inseparably blended if the tea was sold every purchaser would pay a tax imposed by the british parliament as part of the purchase money to obviate this evil and to prevent the liberties of a great country from being sacrificed by inconsiderate purchasers sundry town meetings were held in the capitals of the different provinces and combinations were formed to obstruct the sales of the tea sent by the eastindia company    the resolutions entered into by the inhabitants of philadelphia on october the   th      afford a good specimen of the whole—these were as follows     that the disposal of their own property is the inherent right of freemen that there can be no property in that which another can of right take from us without our consent that the claim of parliament to tax america is in other words a claim of right to levy contributions on us at pleasure     that the duty imposed by parliament upon tea landed in america is a tax on the americans or levying contributions on them without their consent     that the express purpose for which the tax is levied on the americans—namely for the support of government administration of justice and defence of his majestys dominions in america has a direct tendency to render assemblies useless and to introduce arbitrary government and slavery     that a virtuous and steady opposition to this ministerial plan of governing america is absolutely necessary to preserve even the shadow of liberty and is a duty which every freeman in america owes to his country to himself and to his posterity     that the resolution lately entered into by the eastindia company to send out their tea to america subject to the payment of duties on    its being landed here is an open attempt to enforce this ministerial plan and a violent attack upon the liberties of america     that it is the duty of every american to oppose this attempt     that whoever shall directly or indirectly countenance this attempt or in any wise aid or abet in unloading receiving or vending the tea sent or to be sent out by the eastindia company while it remains subject to the payment of a duty here is an enemy to his country     that a committee be immediately chosen to wait on those gentlemen who it is reported are appointed by the eastindia company to receive and sell said tea and request them from a regard to their own character    and the peace and good order of the city and province immediately to resign their appointment as the time approached when the arrival of the tea ships might be soon expected such measures were adopted as seemed most likely to prevent the landing of their cargoes the tea consignees appointed by the eastindia company were in several places compelled to relinquish their appointments and no others could be found hardy enough to act in their stead the pilots in the river delaware were warned not to conduct any of the tea ships into their harbour in newyork popular vengeance was denounced against all who would contribute in any measure to forward the views of the eastindia company the captains of the newyork and philadelphia ships being apprized of the resolution of the people and fearing the consequences of landing a commodity charged with an odious duty in violation of their declared public sentiments concluded to return directly to greatbritain without making any entry at the custom house it was otherwise in massachusetts the tea ships designed for the supply of boston were consigned to the sons cousins and particular friends of governor hutchinson when they were called upon to resign they answered that it was out of their power the collector refused to give a clearance unless the vessels were discharged of dutiable articles the governor refused to give a pass for the vessels unless properly qualified from the customhouse the governor likewise requested admiral montague to guard the passages out of the harbour and gave orders to suffer no vessels coasters excepted to pass the fortress from the town without a pass signed by himself    from a combination of these circumstances the return of the tea vessels from boston was rendered impossible the inhabitants then had no option but to prevent the landing of the tea or to suffer it to be landed and depend on the unanimity of the people not to purchase it or to destroy the tea or to suffer a deep laid scheme against their sacred liberties to take effect the first would have required incessant  00 watching by night as well as by day for a period of time the duration of which no one could compute the second would have been visionary to childishness by suspending the liberties of a growing country on the self denial and discretion of every tea drinker in the province they viewed the tea as the vehicle of an unconstitutional tax and as inseparably associated with it to avoid the one they resolved to destroy the other about seventeen persons dressed as indians repaired to the tea ships broke open     chests of tea and without doing any other damage discharged their contents into the water thus by the inflexibility of the governor the issue of this business was different at boston from what it was elsewhere the whole cargoes of tea were returned from newyork and philadelphia that which was sent to charleston was landed and stored but not offered for sale mr hutchinson had repeatedly urged government at home to be firm and persevering he could not therefore consistent with his honour depart from a line of conduct he had so often and so strongly recommended to his superiors he also believed that the inhabitants would not dare to perfect their engagements and flattered himself that they would desist when the critical moment arrived admitting the rectitude of the american claims of exemption from parliamentary taxation the destruction of the tea by the bostonians was warranted by the great law of self preservation for it was not possible for them by any other means within the compass of probability to discharge the duty they owed to their country the event of this business was very different from what had been expected in england the colonists acted with so much union and system that there was not a single chest of any of the cargoes sent out by the eastindia company on this occasion sold for their benefit intelligence of these proceedings was on the  th of march         communicated in a message from the throne to both houses of parliament in this communication the conduct of the colonists was represented as  0  not only obstructing the commerce of greatbritain but as subversive of its constitution the message was accompanied with a number of papers containing copies and extracts of letters from the several royal governors and others from which it appeared that the opposition to the sale of the tea was not peculiar to massachusetts but common to all the colonies these papers were accompanied with accounts setting forth that nothing short of parliamentary interference was capable of reestablishing order among the turbulent colonists and that therefore decisive measures should be immediately adopted for securing the dependence of the colonies if the right of levying taxes on the americans was vested in the parent state these inferences were well founded but if it was not their conduct in resisting an invasion of their rights was justified not only by many examples in the history of britain but by the spirit of the constitution of that country which they were opposing by the destruction of the tea the people of boston had incurred the sanction of penal laws those in greatbritain who wished for an opportunity to take vengeance on that town commonly supposed by them to be the mother of sedition and rebellion rejoiced that her inhabitants had laid themselves open to castigation it was well known that the throwing of the tea into the river did not originate with the persons who were the immediate instruments of that act of violence that the whole had been concerted at a public meeting and was in a qualified sense the act of the town the universal indignation which in greatbritain was excited against the people of boston pointed out to the ministry the suitableness of the present moment for humbling them though the ostensible ground of complaint was nothing more than a trespass on private property committed by private persons yet it was well known to be part of a long digested plan of resistance to parliamentary taxation every measure that might be pursued on the occasion seemed to be big with the fate of the empire to proceed in the usual forms of law appeared to the rulers in greatbritain to be a departure from their  0  dignity it was urged by the ministry that parliament and parliament only was capable of reestablishing tranquility among    these turbulent people and of bringing order out of confusion to stifle all opposition from the merchants the public papers were filled with writings which stated the impossibility of carrying on a future trade to america if this flagrant outrage on commerce should go unpunished it was in vain urged by the minority that no good could arise from coercion unless the minds of the americans were made easy on the subject of taxation equally vain was a motion for a retrospect into the conduct of the ministry which had provoked their resistance the parliament discovered an aversion from looking back to the original ground of the dispute and confined themselves solely to the late misbehavior of the americans without any enquiry into the provoking causes thereof the violence of the bostonians in destroying an article of commerce was largely insisted upon without any indulgence for the jealous spirit of liberty in the descendants of englishmen the connexion between the tea and the unconstitutional duty imposed thereon was overlooked and the public mind of greatbritain solely fixed on the obstruction given to commerce by the turbulent colonists the spirit raised against the americans became as high and as strong as their most inveterate enemies could desire this was not confined to the common people but took possession of legislators whose unclouded minds ought to be exalted above the mists of prejudice or partiality such when they consult on public affairs should be free from the impulses of passion for it rarely happens that resolutions adopted in anger are founded in wisdom the parliament in greatbritain transported with indignation against the people of boston in a fit of rage resolved to take legislative vengeance on that devoted town disregarding the forms of her own constitution by which none are to be condemned unheard or punished without a trial a bill was finally passed on the   th day  0  after it was first moved for by which the port of boston was virtually blocked up for it was legally precluded from the privilege of landing and discharging or of lading and shipping of goods wares and merchandise the minister who proposed this measure stated in support of it that the opposition to the authority of parliament had always originated in that colony and had always been instigated by the seditious proceedings of the    town of boston that it was therefore necessary to make an example of that town which by an unparalleled outrage had violated the freedom of commerce that greatbritain would be wanting in the protection she owed to her peaceable subjects if she did not punish such an insult in an exemplary manner he therefore proposed that the town of boston should be obliged to pay for the tea which had been destroyed he was farther of opinion that making a pecuniary satisfaction for the injury committed would not alone be sufficient but that in addition thereto security must be given in future that trade may be safely carried on—property protected—laws obeyed—and duties paid he urged therefore that it would be proper to take away from boston the privilege of a port until his majesty should be satisfied in these particulars and publicly declare in council on a proper certificate of the good behaviour of the town that he was so satisfied until this should happen he proposed that the custom house officers should be removed to salem the minister hoped that this act would execute itself or at most that a few frigates would secure its execution he also hoped that the prospect of advantage to the town of salem from its being made the seat of the custom house and from the occlusion of the port of boston would detach them from the interest of the latter and dispose them to support a measure from which they had so much to expect it was also presumed that the other colonies would leave boston to suffer the punishment due to her demerits the abettors of parliamentary supremacy flattered themselves that this decided conduct of greatbritain would forever extinguish all opposition from the refractory colonists to the claims of  0  the mother country and the apparent equity of obliging a delinquent town to make reparation for an injury occasioned by the factious spirit of its inhabitants silenced many of the friends of america the consequences resulting from this measure were the reverse of what were wished for by the first and dreaded by the last by the operation of the boston port act the preceding situation of its inhabitants and that of the eastindia company was reversed the former had more reason to complain of the disproportionate penalty to which they were indiscriminately subjected than the latter of that outrage on their property for which punishment had been inflicted hitherto the eastindia company were the injured party but from the passing of this act the balance of injury was on    the opposite side if wrongs received entitled the former to reparation the latter had a much stronger title on the same ground for the act of seventeen or eighteen individuals twice as many thousands were involved in one general calamity both parties viewed the case on a much larger scale than that of municipal law the people of boston alledged in vindication of their conduct that the tea was a weapon aimed at their liberties and that the same principles of self preservation which justify the breaking of the assassins sword uplifted for destruction equally authorised the destruction of that tea which was the vehicle of an unconstitutional tax subversive of their liberties the parliament of greatbritain considered the act of the people of boston in destroying the tea as an open defiance of that country the demerit of the action as an offence against property was lost in the supposed superior demerit of treasonable intention to emancipate themselves from a state of colonial dependence the americans conceived the case to be intimately connected with their liberties the inhabitants of greatbritain with their supremacy the former considered it as a duty they owed their country to make a common cause with the people of boston the latter thought themselves under equal obligations to support the privileges of parliament  0  on the third reading of the boston port bill a petition was presented by the lord mayor in the name of several natives and inhabitants of north america then residing in london it was drawn with great force of language and stated that the proceedings of parliament against boston were repugnant to every principle of law and justice and established a precedent by which no man in america could enjoy a moments security the friends of parliamentary supremacy had long regretted the democratic constitutions of the provinces as adverse to their schemes they saw with concern the steady opposition that was given to their measures by the american legislatures these constitutions were planned when greatbritain neither feared nor cared for her colonies not suspecting that she was laying the foundation of future states she granted charters that gave to the people so much of the powers of government as enabled them to make not only a formidable but a regular constitutional opposition to the country from which they sprung long had her rulers wished for an opportunity to revoke these    charters and to new model these governments the present moment seemed favourable to this design the temper of the nation was high and the resentment against the province of massachusetts general and violent the late outrages in boston furnished a tolerable pretence for the attempt an act of the british parliament speedily followed the one for shutting up the port of boston entitled an act for the better regulating the government of massachusetts the object of this was to alter the charter of the province in the following particulars the council or second branch of the legislature heretofore elected by the general court was to be from the first of august      appointed by the crown the royal governor was also by the same act invested with the power of appointing and removing all judges of the inferior courts of common pleas—commissioners of oyer and terminer—the attorney general—provost marshal—justices—sheriffs c the town meetings which were sanctioned by the charter were with a few exceptions  0  expressly forbidden to be held without the leave of the governor or lieutenant governor in writing expressing the special business of said meeting first had and obtained and with a farther restriction that no matter should be treated of at these meetings excepting the election of public officers and the business expressed in the leave given by the governor or lieutenant governor jurymen which had been before elected by the freeholders and inhabitants of the several towns were to be by this new act all summoned and returned by the sheriffs of the respective counties the whole executive government was taken out of the hands of the people and the nomination of all important officers vested in the king or his governor this act excited a greater alarm than the port act the one effected only the metropolis the other the whole province the one had the appearance of being merited as it was well known that an act of violence had been committed by its inhabitants under the sanction of a town meeting but the other had no stronger justifying reason than that the proposed alterations were in the opinion of the parliament become absolutely necessary in order to the preservation of the peace and good order of the said province in support of this bill the minister who brought it in alledged that an executive power was wanting in the country the very people said he who commit    the riots are the posse comitatus in which the force of the civil power consists he farther urged the futility of making laws the execution of which under the present form of government in massachusetts might be so easily evaded and therefore contended for a necessity to alter the whole frame of their constitution as far as related to its executive and judicial powers in opposition it was urged that the taking away the civil constitution of a whole people secured by a solemn charter upon general charges of delinquencies and defects was a stretch of power of the most arbitrary and dangerous nature by the english constitution charters were sacred and only revokable by a due course of law and on a conviction  0  of misconduct they were solemn compacts between the prince and the people and without the constitutional power of either party the abettors of the british schemes reasoned in a summary way said they the colonies particularly massachusetts by their circular letters associations and town meetings have for years past thwarted all the measures of government and are meditating independency this turbulent spirit of theirs is fostered by their constitution which invests them with too much power to be consistent with their state of subordination let us therefore lay the axe at the root—new model their charter and lop off those privileges which they have abused when the human mind is agitated with passion it rarely discerns its own interest and but faintly foresees consequences had the parliament stopped short with the boston port act the motives to union and to make a common cause with that metropolis would have been feeble perhaps ineffectual to have roused the other provinces but the arbitrary mutilation of the important privileges contained in a solemn charter without a trial—without a hearing by the will of parliament convinced the most moderate that the cause of massachusetts was the cause of all the provinces it readily occurred to those who guided the helm of greatbritain that riots would probably take place in attempting the execution of the acts just mentioned they also discerned that such was the temper of the people that trials for murders committed in suppressing riots if held in massachusetts would seldom terminate in favour of the parties who were engaged on the side of government to make  00 their system compleat it was necessary to go one step farther and to screen their active friends from the apprehended partiality of such trials it was therefore provided by law that if any person was indicted for murder or for any capital offence committed in aiding magistracy that the governor might send the person so indicted to another colony or to greatbritain to be tried this law was the subject of severe comments it was considered as an act of indemnity to those who should  0  embrue their hands in the blood of their fellow citizens it was asked how the relations of a murdered man could effectually prosecute if they must go three thousand miles to attend that business it was contended that the act by stopping the usual course of justice would probably give rise to assassinations and dark revenge among individuals and encourage all kinds of lawless violence the charge of partiality was retorted for said they if a party spirit against the authority of greatbritain would condemn an active officer in massachusetts as a murderer the same party spirit for preserving the authority of greatbritain would in that country acquit a murderer as a spirited performer of his duty the case of captain preston was also quoted as a proof of the impartial administration of justice in massachusetts the same natives of america who had petitioned against the boston port bill presented a second one against these two bills with uncommon energy of language they pointed out many constitutional objections against them and concluded with fervently beseeching that the parliament would not by passing them reduce their countrymen to an abject state of misery and humiliation or drive them to the last resource of despair the lords of the minority entered also a protest against the passing of each of these bills it was fortunate for the people of boston and those who wished to promote a combination of the colonies against greatbritain that these three several laws passed nearly at the same time they were presented in quick progression either in the form of bills or of acts to the consideration of the inflamed americans and produced effects on their minds infinitely greater than could have been expected from either especially from the boston port act alone when the fire of indignation excited by the first was burning intelligence of these other acts operated like fuel and made it flame  0  out with increasing vehemence the three laws were considered as forming a complete system of tyranny from the operation of which there was no chance of making a peaceable escape  0  by the first said they the property of unoffending thousands is arbitrarily taken away for the act of a few individuals by the second our chartered liberties are annihilated and by the third our lives may be destroyed with impunity property liberty and life are all sacrificed on the altar of ministerial vengeance this mode of reasoning was not peculiar to massachusetts these three acts of parliament contrary to the expectation of those who planned them became a cement of a firm union among the colonies from newhampshire to georgia they now openly said our charters and other rights and immunities must depend on the pleasure of parliament they were sensible that they had all concurred more or less in the same line of opposition which had provoked these severe statutes against massachusetts and they believed that vengeance though delayed was not remitted and that the only favour the least culpable could expect was to be the last that would be devoured the friends of the colonies contended that these laws were in direct contradiction to the letter and the spirit of the british constitution their opposers could support them on no stronger grounds than those of political necessity and expedience they acknowledged them to be contrary to the established mode of proceeding but defended them as tending ultimately to preserve the constitution from the meditated independency of the colonies such was the temper of the people in england that the acts hitherto passed were popular a general opinion had gone forth in the mother country that the people of massachusetts by their violent opposition to government had drawn on themselves merited correction the parliament did not stop here but proceeded one step farther which inflamed their enemies in america and lost them friends in greatbritain the general clamor in the provinces was that the proceedings in the parliament were arbitrary and unconstitutional before they completed their memorable session in the beginning of the year      they passed an act respecting the government of quebec which in the opinion of their friends merited these appellations  0  by this act the government of that   0 province was made to extend southward to the ohio and westward to the banks of the mississippi and northward to the boundary of the hudsons bay company the principal objects of the act were to form a legislative council for all the affairs of the province except taxation which council should be appointed by the crown the office to be held during pleasure and his majestys roman catholic subjects to be entitled to a place therein—to establish the french laws and a trial without jury in civil cases and the english laws with a trial by jury in criminal—to secure to the roman catholic clergy except the regulars the legal enjoyment of their estates and their tythes from all who were of their own religion not only the spirit but the letter of this act were so contrary to the english constitution that it diminished the popularity of the measures which had been formed against the americans among the more southern colonists it was conceived that its evident object was to make the inhabitants of canada fit instruments in the hands of power to reduce them to a state of slavery they well remembered the embarrassments occasioned to them in the late war between france and england by the french inhabitants of canada—they supposed that the british administration meant at this time to use these people in the same line of attack for their subjugation as greatbritain had new modelled the chartered government of massachusetts and claimed an authority so to do in every province the colonists were apprehensive that in the plenitude of her power she would impose on each of them in their turns a constitution similar to what she had projected for the province of canada they foresaw or thought they foresaw the annihilation of their ancient assemblies and their whole legislative business transferred to creatures of the crown the legal parliamentary right to a maintenance conferred on the clergy of the roman catholic religion gave great offence to many in england but the political consequences expected to result from it were most dreaded by the colonists     they viewed the whole act as an evidence that hostilities were intended against them and that part of it which respected religion as calculated to make roman catholicks subservient to the purposes of military coercion  0  the session of parliament which passed these memorable acts had stretched far into summer as it drew near a close the most sanguine expectations were indulged that from the resolution and great unanimity of parliament on all american questions the submission of the colonies would be immediate and their future obedience and tranquility effectually secured the triumphs and congratulations of the friends of the ministry were unusually great in passing the acts which have been just mentioned dissentients in favour of america were unusually few the ministerial majority believing that the refractory colonists depended chiefly on the countenance of their english abettors were of opinion that as soon as they received intelligence of the decrease of their friends and of the decisive conduct of parliament they would acquiesce in the will of greatbritain—the fame and grandeur of the nation was such that it was never imagined they would seriously dare to contend with so formidable a people the late triumphs of greatbritain had made such an impression on her rulers that they believed the americans on seeing the ancient spirit of the nation revive would not risque a trial of prowess with those fleets and armies which the combined force of france and spain were unable to resist by an impious confidence in their superior strength they precipitated the nation into rash measures from the dire effects of which the world may learn a useful lesson  0  history of the american revolution  chapter iv fpage 0  lpage    chapter iv proceedings of the colonies in      in consequence of the boston port act viz the winter which followed the destruction of the tea in boston was an anxious one to those of the     colonists who were given to reflection many conjectures were formed about the line of conduct greatbritain would probably adopt for the support of her dignity the fears of the most timid were more than realized by the news of the boston port bill       this arrived on the  0th of may and its operation was to commence the first of the next month various town meetings were called to deliberate on the state of public affairs on the   th of may the town of boston passed the following vote that it is the opinion of this town that if the other colonies come into a joint resolution to stop all importation from greatbritain and the westindies till the act for blocking up this harbour be repealed  0  the same will prove the salvation of northamerica and her liberties on the other hand if they continue their exports and imports there is high reason to fear that fraud power and the most odious oppression will rise triumphant over justice right social happiness and freedom and moreover that this vote be transmitted by the moderator to all our sister colonies in the name and behalf of this town copies of this vote were transmitted to each of the colonies the opposition to greatbritain had hitherto called forth the pens of the ingenious and in some instances imposed the self denial of nonimportation agreements but the bulk of the people had little to do with the dispute the spirited conduct of the people of boston in destroying the tea and the alarming precedents set by greatbritain in consequence thereof brought subjects into discussion with which every peasant and day labourer was concerned the patriots who had hitherto guided the helm knew well that if the other colonies did not support the people of boston they must be crushed and it was equally obvious that in their coercion a precedent injurious to liberty would be established it was therefore the interest of boston to draw in the other colonies it was also the interest of the patriots in all the colonies to bring over the bulk of the people to adopt such efficient measures as were likely to extricate the inhabitants of     boston from the unhappy situation in which they were involved to effect these purposes much prudence as well as patriotism was necessary the other provinces were but remotely affected by the fate of massachusetts they were happy and had no cause on their own account to oppose the government of greatbritain that a people so circumstanced should take part with a distressed neighbour at the risque of incurring the resentment of the mother country did not accord with the selfish maxims by which states as well as individuals are usually governed the ruled are for the most part prone to suffer as long as evils are tolerable and in general they must feel before they are roused to contend with their oppressors but the americans acted on a contrary principle they commenced an opposition to greatbritain and ultimately engaged in a defensive war on speculation they were not so much moved by oppression actually felt as by a conviction that a foundation was laid and a precedent about to be established for future oppressions  0  to convince the bulk of the people that they had an interest in foregoing a present good and submitting to a present evil in order to obtain a future greater good and to avoid a future greater evil was the task assigned to the colonial patriots but it called for the exertion of their utmost abilities they effected it in a great measure by means of the press pamphlets essays addresses and news paper dissertations were daily presented to the public proving that massachusetts was suffering in the common cause and that interest and policy as well as good neighbourhood required the united exertions of all the colonies in support of that much injured province it was inculcated on the people that if the ministerial schemes were suffered to take effect in massachusetts the other colonies must expect the loss of their charters and that a new government would be imposed upon them like that projected for quebec the king and parliament held no patronage in america sufficient to oppose this torrent the few who ventured to write in their favour found a difficulty in communicating their sentiments to the public     no pensions or preferments awaited their exertions neglect and contempt were their usual portion but popularity consequence and fame were the rewards of those who stepped forward in the cause of liberty in order to interest the great body of people the few who were at the helm disclaimed any thing more decisive than convening the inhabitants and taking their sense on what was proper to be done in the mean time great pains were taken to prepare them for the adoption of vigorous measures the words whigs and tories for want of better were now introduced as the distinguishing names of parties by the former were meant those who were for making a common cause with boston and supporting the colonies in their opposition to the claims of parliament by the latter those who were at least so far favourers of greatbritain that they wished either that no measures or only palliative measures should be adopted in opposition to her schemes these parties were so nearly balanced in newyork that nothing more was agreed to at the first meeting of the inhabitants than a recommendation to call a congress at philadelphia the patriots had a delicate part to act the government of the colony being proprietary a multitude of officers  0  connected with that interest had much to fear from convulsions and nothing to expect from a revolution a still greater body of people called quakers denied the lawfulness of war and therefore could not adopt such measures for the support of boston as naturally tended to produce an event so adverse to their system of religion the citizens of boston not only sent forward their public letter to the citizens of philadelphia but accompanied it with private communications to individuals of known patriotism and influence in which they stated the impossibility of their standing alone against the torrent of ministerial vengeance and the indispensable necessity that the leading colony of pennsylvania should afford them its support and countenance the advocates in philadelphia for making a common cause     with boston were fully sensible of the state of parties in pennsylvania they saw the dispute with greatbritain brought to a crisis and a new scene opening which required exertions different from any heretofore made the success of these they well knew depended on the wisdom with which they were planned and the union of the whole people in carrying them into execution may  0  they saw the propriety of proceeding with the greatest circumspection and therefore resolved at their first meeting on nothing more than to call a general meeting of the inhabitants on the next evening     at this second meeting the patriots had so much moderation and policy as to urge nothing decisive contenting themselves with taking the sense of the inhabitants simply on the propriety of sending an answer to the public letter from boston this was universally approved the letter agreed upon was firm but temperate they acknowledged the difficulty of offering advice on the present occasion sympathized with the people of boston in their distress and observed that all lenient measures for their relief should be first tried that if the making restitution for the tea destroyed would put an end to the unhappy controversy and leave the people of boston upon their ancient footing of constitutional liberty it could not admit of a doubt what part they should act but that it was not the value of the tea it was the indefeasible right of giving and granting their own money which was the matter in consideration that it was the common cause of america and therefore necessary in their opinion that a congress of deputies from the several colonies should be convened to devise means  0  for restoring harmony between greatbritain and the colonies and preventing matters from coming to extremities till this could be brought about they recommended firmness prudence and moderation to the immediate sufferers assuring them that the people of pennsylvania would continue to evince a firm adherence to the cause of american liberty in order to awaken the attention of the people a series of letters was published well calculated to rouse     them to a sense of their danger and point out the fatal consequences of the late acts of parliament every newspaper teemed with dissertations in favour of liberty—with debates of the members of parliament especially with the speeches of the favourers of america and the protests of the dissenting lords the latter had a particular effect on the colonists and were considered by them as irrefragable proofs that the late acts against massachusetts were unconstitutional and arbitrary the minds of the people being thus prepared the friends of liberty promoted a petition to the governor for convening the assembly this they knew would not be granted and that the refusal of it would smooth the way for calling the inhabitants together jun     the governor having refused to call the assembly a general meeting of the inhabitants was requested about  000 met and adopted sundry spirited resolutions in these they declared that the boston port act was unconstitutional—that it was expedient to convene a continental congress—to appoint a committee for the city and county of philadelphia to correspond with their sister colonies and the several counties of pennsylvania and to invest that committee with power to determine on the best mode for collecting the sense of the province and appointing deputies to attend a general congress     under the sanction of this last resolve the committee appointed for that purpose wrote a circular letter to all the counties of the province requesting them to appoint deputies to a general meeting proposed to be held on the   th of july part of this letter was in the following words we would not offer such an affront to the well known public spirit of pennsylvanians as to question your zeal on the present occasion our very existence in the rank of freemen and the security of all that ought  0  to be dear to us evidently depends on our conducting this great cause to its proper issue by firmness wisdom and magnanimity it is with pleasure we assure you that all the colonies from southcarolina to newhampshire are animated with one spirit in the common cause and consider that as the proper crisis for having our differences with the mother country     brought to some certain issue and our liberties fixed upon a permanent foundation this desirable end can only be accomplished by a free communication of sentiments and a sincere and fervent regard for the interests of our common country the several counties readily complied with the request of the inhabitants of philadelphia and appointed deputies who met at the time appointed and passed sundry resolves in which they reprobated the late acts of parliament—expressed their sympathy with boston as suffering in the common cause—approved of holding a congress and declared their willingness to make any sacrifices that might be recommended by a congress for securing their liberties thus without tumult disorder or divided counsels the whole province of pennsylvania was by prudent management and temperate proceedings brought into the opposition with its whole weight and influence this is the more remarkable as it is probable that if the sentiments of individuals had been separately taken there would have been a majority against involving themselves in the consequences of taking part with the destroyers of the tea at boston while these proceedings were carrying on in pennsylvania three of the most distinguished patriots of philadelphia under color of an excursion of pleasure made a tour throughout the province in order to discover the real sentiments of the common people they were well apprized of the consequences of taking the lead in a dispute which every day became more serious unless they could depend on being supported by the yeomanry of the country by freely associating and conversing with many of every class and denomination they found them unanimous in that fundamental principle of the american controversy that the parliament of greatbritain had no right to tax them from their general determination on this subject a favourable prognostic was formed of a successful opposition to the claims of greatbritain in virginia the house of burgesses on the   th of may        0 resolved that the first of june the day on which     the operation of the boston port bill was to commence should be set apart by the members as a day of fasting humiliation and prayer devoutly to implore the divine interposition for averting the heavy calamities which threatened destruction to their civil rights and the evils of a civil war—to give them one heart and one mind to oppose by all just and proper means every injury to american rights on the publication of this resolution the royal governor the earl of dunmore dissolved them the members notwithstanding their dissolution met in their private capacities and signed an agreement in which among other things they declared that an attack made on one of their sister colonies to compel submission to arbitrary taxes was an attack made on all british america and threatened ruin to the rights of all unless the united wisdom of the whole be applied in southcarolina the vote of the town of boston of the   th of may being presented to a number of the leading citizens in charleston it was unanimously agreed to call a meeting of the inhabitants that this might be as general as possible letters were sent to every parish and district in the province and the people were invited to attend either personally or by their representatives at a general meeting of the inhabitants july          a large number assembled in which were some from almost every part of the province the proceedings of the parliament against the province of massachusetts were distinctly related to this convention without one dissenting voice they passed sundry resolutions expressive of their rights and of their sympathy with the people of boston they also chose five delegates to represent them in a continental congress and invested them with full powers and authority in behalf of them and their constituents to concert agree to and effectually to prosecute such legal measures as in their opinion and the opinion of the other members would be most likely to obtain a redress of american grievances the events of this time may be transmitted to posterity but the agitation of the public mind can never be fully comprehended but by those who were witnesses of it     in the counties and towns of the several provinces as well as in the cities the people assembled and passed resolutions expressive of their rights and of their detestation of the late american     acts of parliament these had an instantaneous effect on the minds of thousands not only the young and impetuous but the aged and temperate joined in pronouncing them to be unconstitutional and oppressive they viewed them as deadly weapons aimed at the vitals of that liberty which they adored as rendering abortive the generous pains taken by their forefathers to procure for them in a new world the quiet enjoyment of their rights they were the subjects of their meditation when alone and of their conversation when in company within little more than a month after the news of the boston port bill reached america it was communicated from state to state and a flame was kindled in almost every breast through the widely extended provinces in order to understand the mode by which this flame was spread with such rapidity over so great an extent of country it is necessary to observe that the several colonies were divided into counties and these again subdivided into districts distinguished by the names of towns townships precincts hundreds or parishes in newengland the subdivisions which are called towns were by law bodies corporate—had their regular meetings and might be occasionally convened by their proper officers the advantages derived from these meetings by uniting the whole body of the people in the measures taken to oppose the stamp act induced other provinces to follow the example accordingly under the association which was formed to oppose the revenue act of      committees were established not only in the capitals of every province but also in most of the subordinate districts greatbritain without designing it had by her two preceding attempts at american revenue taught her colonies not only the advantages but the means of union the system of committees which prevailed in      and also in      was revived in      by them there was a quick transmission of intelligence from the capital towns through   0 the subordinate districts to the whole body of the people and a union of counsels and measures was effected among widely disseminated inhabitants it is perhaps impossible for human wisdom to contrive any system more subservient to these purposes than such a reciprocal exchange of intelligence by committees from the want of such a communication with each other and consequently of union among themselves     many states have lost their liberties and more have been unsuccessful in their attempts to regain them after they have been lost what the eloquence and talents of demosthenes could not effect among the states of greece might have been effected by the simple device of committees of correspondence the few have been enabled to keep the many in subjection in every age from the want of union among the latter several of the provinces of spain complained of oppression under charles the  th and in transports of rage took arms against him but they never consulted or communicated with each other they resisted separately and were therefore separately subdued the colonists sympathizing with their distressed brethren in massachusetts felt themselves called upon to do something for their relief but to determine on what was proper to be done did not so obviously occur it was a natural idea that for harmonising their measures a congress of deputies from each province should be convened this early occurred to all and being agreed to by all was the means of procuring union and concert among inhabitants removed several hundred miles from each other in times less animated various questions about the place and legality of their meeting and about the extent of their power would have produced a great diversity of sentiments but on this occasion by the special agency of providence there was the same universal bent of inclination in the great body of the people a sense of common danger extinguished selfish passions the public attention was fixed on the great cause of liberty local attachments and partialities were sacrificed on the altar of patriotism there were not wanting moderate men who would     have been willing to pay for the tea destroyed if that would have put an end to the controversy for it was not the value of the tea nor of the tax but the indefeasible right of giving and granting their money for which the colonists contended the act of parliament was so cautiously worded as to prevent the opening of the port of boston even though the eastindia company had been reimbursed for all damages until it was made to appear to his majesty in council that peace and obedience to the laws were so far restored in the town of boston that the trade of greatbritain might be safely earried     on there and his majestys customs duly collected the latter part of this limitation the due collection of his majestys customs was understood to comprehend submission to the late revenue laws it was therefore inferred that payment for the tea destroyed would produce no certain relief unless they were willing to give operation to the law for raising a revenue on future importations of that commodity and also to acquiesce in the late mutilation of their charter as it was deliberately resolved never to submit to either the most lukewarm of well informed patriots possessing the public confidence neither advised nor wished for the adoption of that measure a few in boston who were known to be in the royal interest proposed a resolution for that purpose but they met with no support of the many who joined the british in the course of the war there was scarcely an individual to be found in this early stage of the contriversy who advocated the right of parliamentary taxation there were doubtless many timid persons who fearing the power of britain would rather have submitted to her encroachments than risque the vengeance of her arms but such for the most part suppressed their sentiments zeal for liberty being immediately rewarded with applause the patriots had every inducement to come forward and avow their principles but there was something so unpopular in appearing to be influenced by timidity interest or excessive caution when essential interests were attacked that such persons shunned public notice and sought the shade of retirement     in the three first months which followed the shutting up of the port of boston the inhabitants of the colonies in hundreds of small circles as well as in their provincial assemblies and congresses expressed their abhorrence of the late proceedings of the british parliament against massachusetts—their concurrence in the proposed measure of appointing deputies for a general congress and their willingness to do and suffer whatever should be judged conducive to the establishment of their liberties a patriotic flame created and diffused by the contagion of sympathy was communicated to so many breasts and reflected from such a variety of objects as to become too intense to be resisted while the combination of the other colonies to support boston was gaining strength new matter of dissention daily took place in     massachusetts the resolution for shutting the port of boston was no sooner taken than it was determined to order a military force to that town general gage the commander in chief of the royal forces in northamerica was also sent thither in the additional capacity of governor of massachusetts he arrived in boston on the third day after the inhabitants received the first intelligence of the boston port bill though the people were irritated by that measure and though their republican jealousy was hurt by the combination of the civil and military character in one person yet the general was received with all the honours which had been usually paid to his predecessors soon after his arrival two regiments of foot with a detachment of artillery and some cannon were landed in boston these troops were by degrees reinforced with others from ireland newyork halifax and quebec the governor announced that he had the kings particular command for holding the general court at salem after the first of june when that eventful day arrived the act for shutting up the port of boston commenced its operation it was devoutly kept at williamsburgh as a day of fasting and humiliation in philadelphia it was solemnized with every manifestation of public calamity and grief the inhabitants shut up their houses after     divine service a stillness reigned over the city which exhibited an appearance of the deepest distress in boston a new scene opened on the inhabitants hitherto that town had been the seat of commerce and of plenty the immense business carried on therein afforded a comfortable subsistence to many thousands the necessary—the useful and even some of the elegant arts were cultivated among them the citizens were polite and hospitable in this happy state they were sentenced on the short notice of twenty one days to a total deprivation of all means of subsisting the blow reached every person the rents of the landholders either ceased or were greatly diminished the immense property in stores and wharfs was rendered comparatively useless labourers artifices and others employed in the numerous occupations created by an extensive trade partook in the general calamity they who depended on a regular income flowing from previous acquisitions of property as well as they who with the sweat of their     brow earned their daily subsistence were equally deprived of the means of support and the chief difference between them was that the distresses of the former were rendered more intolerable by the recollection of past enjoyments all these inconveniences and hardships were born with a passive but inflexible fortitude their determination to persist in the same line of conduct which had been the occasion of their suffering was unabated the authors and advisers of the resolution for destroying the tea were in the town and still retained their popularity and influence the execrations of the inhabitants fell not on them but on the british parliament their countrymen acquitted them of all selfish designs and believed that in their opposition to the measures of greatbritain they were actuated by an honest zeal for constitutional liberty the sufferers in boston had the consolation of sympathy from the other colonists contributions were raised in all quarters for their relief letters and addresses came to them from corporate bodies town meetings and provincial conventions applauding their conduct and exhorting them to perseverance     the people of marblehead who by their proximity were likely to reap advantage from the distresses of boston generously offered the merchants thereof the use of their harbour wharfs warehouses and also their personal attendance on the lading or unlading of their goods free of all expence the inhabitants of salem in an address to governor gage concluded with these remarkable words by shutting up the port of boston some imagine that the course of trade might be turned hither and to our benefit but nature in the formation of our harbour forbid our becoming rivals in commerce with that convenient mart and were it otherwise we must be dead to every idea of justice lost to all feelings of humanity could we indulge one thought to seize on wealth and raise our fortunes on the ruins of our suffering neighbours the massachusetts general court met at salem according to adjournment on the  th of june several of the popular leaders took in a private way the sense of the members on what was proper to be done finding they were able to carry such measures as the public     exigencies required they prepared resolves and moved for their adoption but before they went on the latter business their door was shut one member nevertheless contrived means of sending information to governor gage of what was doing his secretary was sent off to dissolve the general court but was refused admission as he could obtain no entrance he read the proclamation at the door and immediately after in council and thus dissolved the general court the house while sitting with their doors shut appointed five of the most respectable inhabitants as their committee to meet committees from other provinces that might be convened the first of september at philadelphia—voted them    pounds sterling each and recommended to the several towns and districts to raise the said sum by equitable proportions by these means the designs of the governor were disappointed his situation in every respect was truly disageeable it was his duty to forward the execution of laws which were universally execrated zeal for     his masters service prompted him to endeavour that they should be earned into full effect but his progress was retarded by obstacles from every quarter he had to transact his official business with a people who possessed a high sense of liberty and were uncommonly ingenious in evading disagreeable acts of parliament it was a part of his duty to prevent the calling of the town meetings after the first of august      these meetings were nevertheless held on his proposing to exert authority for the dispersion of the people he was told by the select men that they had not offended against the act of parliament for that only prohibited the calling of town meetings and that no such call had been made a former constitutional meeting before the first of august having only adjourned themselves from time to time other evasions equally founded on the letter of even the late obnoxious laws were practised as the summer advanced the people of massachusetts received stronger proofs of support from the neighbouring provinces they were therefore encouraged to farther opposition the inhabitants of the colonies at this time with regard to political opinions might be divided into three classes of these one was for rushing precipitately into extremities they were for immediately stopping all trade and     could not even brook the delay of waiting till the proposed continental congress should meet another party equally respectable both as to character property and patriotism was more moderate but not less firm these were averse to the adoption of any violent resolutions till all others were ineffectually tried they wished that a clear statement of their rights claims and grievances should precede every other measure a third class disapproved of what was generally going on a few from principle and a persuasion that they ought to submit to the mother country some from the love of ease others from selfinterest but the bulk from fear of the mischievous consequences likely to follow all these latter classes for the most part lay still while the friends of liberty acted with spirit if they or any of them ventured to oppose popular measures they     were not supported and therefore declined farther efforts the resentment of the people was so strong against them that they sought for peace by remaining quiet the same indecision that made them willing to submit to greatbritain made them apparently acquiesce in popular measures which they disapproved the spirited part of the community being on the side of liberty the patriots had the appearance of unanimity though many either kept at a distance from public meetings or voted against their own opinion to secure themselves from resentment and promote their present ease and interest under the influence of those who were for the immediate adoption of efficacious measures an agreement by the name of the solemn league and covenant was adopted by numbers the subscribers of this bound themselves to suspend all commercial intercourse with greatbritain until the late obnoxious laws were repealed and the colony of massachusetts restored to its chartered rights june    general gage published a proclamation in which he stiled this solemn league and covenant an unlawful hostile and traitorous combination and all magistrates were charged to apprehend and secure for trial such as should have any agency in publishing or subscribing the same or any similar covenant this proclamation had no other effect than to exercise the pens of the lawyers in shewing that the association did not come within the description of legal treason and that therefore the governors proclamation was not warranted by the principles of the constitution     the late law for regulating the government of the provinces arrived near the beginning of august and was accompanied with a list of    new counsellors appointed by the crown and in a mode variant from that prescribed by the charter several of these in the first instance declined an acceptance of the appointment those who accepted of it were every where declared to be enemies to their country the new judges were rendered incapable of proceeding in their official duty upon opening the courts the juries refused to be sworn or to act in any manner either under them or in conformity to the late     regulations aug    in some places the people assembled and filled the courthouses and avenues to them in such a manner that neither the judges nor their officers could obtain entrance and upon the sheriffs commanding them to make way for the court they answered that they knew no court independent of the ancient laws of their country and to none other would they submit in imitation of his royal master governor gage issued a proclamation for the encouragement of piety and virtue and for the prevention and punishing vice prophaneness and immorality in this proclamation hypocrisy was inserted as one of the immoralities against which the people were warned this was considered by the inhabitants who had often been ridiculed for their strict attention to the forms of religion to be a studied insult and as such was more resented than an actual injury it greatly added to the inflammation which had already taken place in their minds the proceedings and apparent dispositions of the people together with the military preparations which were daily made through the province induced general gage to fortify that neck of land which joins boston to the continent he also seized upon the powder which was lodged in the arsenal at charlestown sept   this excited a most violent and universal ferment several thousands of the people assembled at cambridge and it was with difficulty they were restrained from marching directly to boston to demand a delivery of the powder with a resolution in case of refusal to attack the troops the people thus assembled proceeded to lieutenant governor olivers house and to the houses of several of the new counsellors     and obliged them to resign and to declare that they would no more act under the laws lately enacted in the confusion of these transactions a rumor went abroad that the royal fleet and troops were firing upon the town of boston this was probably designed by the popular leaders on purpose to ascertain what aid they might expect from the country in case of extremities the result exceeded their most sanguine expectations     in less than twenty four hours there were upwards of  0000 men in arms and marching towards the capital other risings of the people took place in different parts of the colony and their violence was such that in a short time the new counsellors the commissioners of the customs and all who had taken an active part in favour of greatbritain were obliged to skreen themselves in boston the new seat of government at salem was abandoned and all the officers connected with the revenue were obliged to consult their safety by taking up their residence in a place which an act of parliament had proscribed from all trade about this time delegates from every town and district in the county of suffolk of which boston is the county town had a meeting at which they prefaced a number of spirited resolutions containing a detail of the particulars of their intended opposition to the late acts of parliament with a general declaration that no obedience was due from the province to either or any part of the said acts but that they should be rejected as the attempts of a wicked administration to enslave america the resolves of this meeting were sent on to philadelphia for the information and opinion of the congress which as shall be hereafter related had met there about this time the people of massachusetts rightly judged that from the decision of congress on these resolutions they would be enabled to determine what support they might expect notwithstanding present appearances they feared that the other colonies who were no more than remotely concerned would not hazard the consequences of making a common cause with them should subsequent events make it necessary to repel force by force the decision of congress exceeded their expectations they most thoroughly approved the wisdom and fortitude with which opposition to wicked ministerial measures had been hitherto conducted in massachusetts and recommended to them perseverance in the same firm and temperate conduct as   0 expressed in the resolutions of the delegates from the county of suffolk       by this approbation and advice the     people of massachusetts were encouraged to resistance and the other colonies became bound to support them the former more in need of a bridle than a spur proceeded as they had begun but with additional confidence oct   governor gage had issued writs for holding a general assembly at salem but subsequent events and the heat and violence which every where prevailed made him think it expedient to counteract the writs by a proclamation for suspending the meeting of the members the legality of a proclamation for that purpose was denied and in defiance thereof  0 of the newly elected members met at the time and place appointed they soon after resolved themselves into a provincial congress and adjourned to concord about  0 miles from charlestown on their meeting there they chose mr hancock president and proceeded to business one of their first acts was to appoint a committee to wait on the governor with a remonstrance in which they apologized for their meeting from the distressed state of the colony complained of their grievances and after stating their apprehensions from the hostile preparations on boston neck concluded with an earnest request that he would desist from the construction of the fortress at the entrance into boston and restore that pass to its natural state the governor found some difficulty in giving them an answer as they were not in his opinion a legal body but the necessity of the times overruled his scruples he replied by expressing his indignation at the supposition that the lives liberties or property of any people except enemies could be in danger from english troops he reminded them that while they complained of alterations made in their charter by acts of parliament they were by their own acts subverting it altogether he therefore warned them of the rocks they were upon and to desist from such illegal and unconstitutional proceedings the governors admonitions were unavailing the provincial congress appointed a committee to draw up a plan for the immediate defence of the province it was resolved to inlist a number of the inhabitants under the name of minute men who were to be under obligations to turn out at a   0 minutes warning jedediah pribble artemas ward and seth pomeroy were     elected general officers to command those minute men and the militia in case they should be called out to action a committee of safety and a committee of supplies were appointed these consisted of different persons and were intended for different purposes the first were invested with an authority to assemble the militia when they thought proper and were to recommend to the committee of supplies the purchase of such articles as the public exigencies required the last were limited to the small sum of £       s sterl which was all the money at first voted to oppose the power and riches of great britain under this authority and with these means the committees of safety and of supplies acting in concert laid in a quantity of stores partly at worcester and partly at concord nov     the same congress met again and soon after resolved to get in readiness twelve thousand men to act on any given emergency and that a fourth part of the militia should be inlisted as minute men and receive pay john thomas and william heath were appointed general officers they also sent persons to newhampshire rhodeisland and connecticut to inform them of the steps they had taken and to request their cooperation in making up an army of  0000 men committees from these several colonies met with a committee from the provincial congress of massachusetts and settled their plans the proper period of commencing opposition to general gages troops was determined to be whenever they marched out with their baggage ammunition and artillery the aid of the clergy was called in upon this occasion and a circular letter was addressed to each of the several ministers in the province requesting their assistance in avoiding the dreadful slavery with which they were threatened as the winter approached general gage ordered barracks for his troops to be erected but such was the superior influence of the popular leaders that on their recommendation the workmen desisted from fulfilling the generals wishes though the money for their labour would have been paid by the crown      an application to newyork was equally unsuccessful     and it was with difficulty that the troops could be furnished with winter lodgings similar obstructions were thrown in the way of getting winter covering for the soldiery the merchants of newyork on being applied to answered that they would never supply any article     for the benefit of men who were sent as enemies to the country the inhabitants of massachusetts encouraged the desertion of the soldiers and acted systematically in preventing their obtaining any other supplies but necessary provisions the farmers were discouraged from selling them straw timber boards and such like articles of convenience straw when purchased for their service was frequently burnt vessels with bricks intended for their use were sunk and carts with wood were overturned and the kings property by one contrivance or other was daily destroyed a proclamation had been issued by the king prohibiting the exportation of military stores from britain which reached america in the latter end of the year      dec     on receiving intelligence thereof in rhodeisland the people seized upon and removed from the public battery about  0 pieces of cannon and the assembly passed resolutions for obtaining arms and military stores by every means and also for raising and arming the inhabitants soon after  00 men beset his majestys castle at portsmouth they sustained a fire from three fourpounders and small arms but before they could be ready for a second fire the assailants stormed the fort and secured and confined the garrison till they broke open the powder house and took the powder away the powder being secured the garrison was released from confinement throughout this whole season civil government legislation judicial proceedings and commercial regulations were in massachusetts to all appearance annihilated the provincial congress exercised all the semblance of government which existed from their coincidence with the prevailing disposition of the people their resolutions had the weight and efficacy of laws       under the simple stile of recommendation they organized the militia made ordinances respecting public monies and such farther regulations     as were necessary for preserving order and for defending themselves against the british troops in this crisis it seemed to be the sense of the inhabitants of massachusetts to wait events they dreaded every evil that could flow from resistance less than the operation of the late acts of parliament but at the same time were averse to be the aggressors in bringing on a civil war they chose to submit to a suspension of     regular government in preference to permitting the streams of justice to flow in the channel prescribed by the late acts of parliament or to conducting them forcibly in the old one sanctioned by their charter from the extinction of the old and the rejection of the new constitution all regular government was for several months abolished some hundred thousands of people were in a state of nature without legislation magistrates or executive officers there was nevertheless a surprising degree of order men of the purest morals were among the most active opposers of greatbritain while municipal laws ceased to operate the laws of reason morality and religion bound the people to each other as a social band and preserved as great a degree of a decorum as had at any time prevailed even those who were opposed to the proceedings of the populace when they were prudent and moderate for the most part enjoyed safety both at home and abroad though there were no civil officers there was an abundance of military ones these were chosen by the people but exercised more authority than any who had been honoured with commissions from the governor the inhabitants in every place devoted themselves to arms handling the musket and training were the fashionable amusements of the men while the women by their presence encouraged them to proceed the sound of drums and fifes was to be heard in all directions the young and the old were fired with a martial spirit on experiment it was found that to force on the inhabitants a form of government to which they were totally averse was not within the fancied omnipotence of parliament      during these transactions in massachusetts effectual     measures had been taken by the colonies for convening a continental congress though there was no one entitled to lead in this business yet in consequence of the general impulse on the public mind from a sense of common danger not only the measure itself but the time and place of meeting were with surprising unanimity agreed upon the colonies though formerly agitated with local prejudices jealousies and aversions were led to assemble together in a general diet and to feel their weight and importance in a common union within four months from the day on which the first intelligence of the boston port bill reached america the deputies of eleven provinces     had convened in philadelphia and in four days more by the arrival of delegates from northcarolina there was a complete representation of twelve colonies containing three millions of people disseminated over   0000 square miles of territory some of the delegates were appointed by the constitutional assemblies in other provinces where they were embarrassed by royal governors the appointments were made in voluntary meetings of the people perhaps there never was a body of delegates more faithful to the interest of their constituents than the congress of      the public voice elevated none to a seat in that august assembly but such as in addition to considerable abilities possessed that ascendancy over the minds of their fellow citizens which can neither be acquired by birth nor purchased by wealth the instructions given to these deputies were various but in general they contained strong professions of loyalty and of constitutional dependence on the mother country the framers of them acknowledged the prerogatives of the crown and disclaimed every wish of separation from the parent state on the other hand they were firm in declaring that they were entitled to all the rights of british born subjects and that the late acts respecting massachusetts were unconstitutional and oppressive      they particularly stated their grievances and for the most part concurred in authorising their deputies to concert and agree to such measures in behalf of their constituents     as in their joint opinion would be most likely to obtain a redress of american grievances ascertain american rights on constitutional principles and establish union and harmony between greatbritain and the colonies of the various instructions on this occasion those which were drawn up by a convention of delegates from every county in the province of pennsylvania and presented by them in a body to the constitutional assembly were the most precise and determinate by these it appears that the pennsylvanians were disposed to submit to the acts of navigation as they then stood and also to settle a certain annual revenue on his majesty his heirs and successors subject to the control of parliament and to satisfy all damages done to the eastindia company provided their grievances were redressed and an amicable compact was settled which by establishing american rights     in the manner of a new magna charta would have precluded future disputes of the whole number of deputies which formed the continental congress of      one half were lawyers gentlemen of that profession had acquired the confidence of the inhabitants by their exertions in the common cause the previous measures in the respective provinces had been planned and carried into effect more by lawyers than by any other order of men professionally taught the rights of the people they were among the foremost to decry every attack made on their liberties bred in the habits of public speaking they made a distinguished figure in the meetings of the people and were particularly able to explain to them the tendency of the late acts of parliament exerting their abilities and influence in the cause of their country they were rewarded with its confidence on the meeting of congress they chose peyton randolph their president and charles thomson their secretary they agreed as one of the rules of their doing business that no entry should be made on their journals of any propositions discussed before them to which they did not finally assent      this august body to which all the colonies looked up     for wisdom and direction had scarcely convened when a dispute arose about the mode of conducting business which alarmed the friends of union it was contended by some that the votes of the small provinces should not count as much as those of the larger ones this was argued with some warmth and invidious comparisons were made between the extensive dominion of virginia and the small colonies of delaware and rhodeisland the impossibility of fixing the comparative weight of each province from the want of proper materials induced congress to resolve that each should have one equal vote the mode of conducting business being settled two committees were appointed one to state the rights of the colonies the several instances in which these rights had been violated and the means most proper to be pursued for obtaining a restoration of them the other to examine and report the several statutes which affected the trade and manufactures of the colonies the first committee were farther instructed to confine themselves to the consideration of such rights as had been infringed since the year          congress soon after their meeting agreed upon a declaration of their rights by which it was among other things declared that the inhabitants of the english colonies in northamerica by the immutable laws of nature the principles of the english constitution and the several charters or compacts were entitled to life liberty and property and that they had never ceded to any sovereign power whatever a right to dispose of either without their consent       that their ancestors who first settled the colonies were entitled to all the rights liberties and immunities of free and natural born subjects within the realm of england and that by their migrating to america they by no means forfeited surrendered or lost any of those rights that the foundation of english liberty and of all free government was a right in the people to participate in their legislative council and that as the english colonists were not and could not be properly represented in the british parliament they were entitled to a free and exclusive power of legislation in their     several provincial legislatures in all cases of taxation and internal polity subject only to the negative of their sovereign they then run the line between the supremacy of parliament and the independency of the colonial legislatures by provisoes and restrictions expressed in the following words but from the necessity of the case and a regard to the mutual interests of both countries we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the british parliament as are bona fide restrained to the regulation of our external commerce for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country and the commercial benefits of its respective members excluding every idea of taxation internal and external for raising a revenue on the subjects in america without their consent this was the very hinge of the controversy the absolute unlimited supremacy of the british parliament both in legislation and taxation was contended for on one side while on the other no farther authority was conceded than such a limited legislation with regard to external commerce as would combine the interest of the whole empire in government as well as in religion there are mysteries from the close investigation of which little advantage can be expected     from the unity of the empire it was necessary that some acts should extend over the whole from the local situation of the colonies it was equally reasonable that their legislatures should at least in some matters be independent where the supremacy of the first ended and the independency of the last began was to the best informed a puzzling question happy would it have been for both countries had the discussion of this doubtful point never been attempted congress also resolved that the colonists were entitled to the common law of england and more especially to the privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage that they were entitled to the benefit of such of the english statutes as existed at the time of their colonization and which they had found to be applicable to their local circumstances and also to the immunities and privileges granted and confirmed to them by royal charters or secured     by provincial laws       that they had a right peaceably to assemble consider of their grievances and petition the king that the keeping a standing army in the colonies without the consent of the legislature of the colony where the army was kept was against law that it was indispensibly necessary to good government and rendered essential by the english constitution that the constituent branches of the legislature be independent of each other and that therefore the exercise of legislative power in several colonies by a council appointed during pleasure by the crown was unconstitutional dangerous and destructive to the freedom of american legislation all of these liberties congress in behalf of themselves and their constituents claimed demanded and insisted upon as their indubitable rights which could not be legally taken from them altered or abridged by any power whatever without their consent congress then resolved that sundry acts which had been passed in the reign of george the third were infringements and violations of the rights of the colonists and that the repeal of them was essentially necessary in order to restore harmony between greatbritain and the colonies the acts complained of were as follow the several acts of   george iii ch    and ch      geo iii ch      geo iii ch      geo iii ch    and ch      geo iii ch    which imposed duties for the purpose of raising a revenue in america extended the power of the admiralty courts beyond their ancient limits deprived the american subject     of trial by jury authorized the judges certificate to indemnify the prosecutor from damages that he might otherwise be liable to requiring oppressive security from a claimant of ships and goods seized before he was allowed to defend his property      also    geo iii ch    entitled an act for the better securing his majestys dock yards magazines ships ammunition and stores which declares a new offence in america and deprives the american subject of a constitutional trial by jury of the vicinage by authorizing the trial of any person charged with the committing any offence described in the said act out of the realm to be indicted     and tried for the same in any shire or county within the realm also the three acts passed in the last session of parliament for stopping the port and blocking up the harbour of boston for altering the charter and government of massachusetts bay and that which is entitled an act for the better administration of justice c also the act passed in the same session for establishing the roman catholic religion in the province of quebec abolishing the equitable system of english laws and erecting a tyranny there to the great danger from so total a dissimilarity of religion law and government of the neighbouring british colonies by the assistance of whose blood and treasure the said country had been conquered from france also the act passed in the same session for the better providing suitable quarters for officers and soldiers in his majestys service in northamerica also that the keeping a standing army in several of these colonies in time of peace without the consent of the legislature of that colony in which such army was kept was against law congress declared that they could not submit to these grievous acts and measures in hopes that their fellow subjects in greatbritain would restore the colonies to that state in which both countries found happiness and prosperity they resolved for the present only to pursue the following peaceable measures  st to enter into a nonimportation nonconsumption and nonexportation agreement or association  d to prepare an address to the people of greatbritain and a memorial to the inhabitants of british america and  dly to prepare a loyal address to his majesty      by the association they bound themselves and their constituents     from and after the  st day of december next not to import into british america from greatbritain or ireland any goods wares or merchandize whatsoever not to purchase any slave imported after the said first day of december not to purchase or use any tea imported on account of the eastindia company or     any on which a duty hath been or shall be paid and from and after the first day of the next ensuing march neither to purchase or use any eastindia tea whatever that they would not after the tenth day of the next september if their grievances were not previously redressed export any commodity whatsoever to greatbritain ireland or the westindies except rice to europe that the merchants should as soon as possible write to their correspondents in greatbritain and ireland not to ship any goods to them on any pretence whatever and if any merchant there should ship any goods for america in order to contravene the nonimportation agreement they would not afterwards have any commercial connexion with such merchant that such as were owners of vessels should give positive orders to their captains and masters not to receive on board their vessels any goods prohibited by the said nonimportation agreement that they would use their endeavors to improve the breed of sheep and increase their numbers to the greatest extent that they would encourage frugality oeconomy and industry and promote agriculture arts and american manufactures that they would discountenance and discourage every species of extravagance and dissipation and that on the death of relations or friends they would wear no other mourning than a small piece of black crape or ribbon that such as were venders of goods should not take any advantage of the scarcity so as to raise their prices that if any person should import goods after the first day of december and before the first day of february then next ensuing the same ought to be immediately reshipped or delivered up to a committee to be stored or sold in the last case all the clear profits to be applied towards the relief of the inhabitants of boston and that if any goods should be imported after the first day of february then next ensuing they should be sent back without breaking any of the packages that committees be chosen in every county city and town to observe the conduct of all persons touching the association and to publish in gazettes the names of the violaters of it as foes to the rights of british america that the committees of correspondence   0 in the respective colonies frequently inspect the entries of their custom houses and inform each other from time to time of the true state thereof that all manufactures of america should be sold at reasonable prices and no   0 advantages be taken of a future scarcity of goods and lastly that they would have no dealings or intercourse whatever with any province or colony of northamerica which should not accede to or should violate the aforesaid associations these several resolutions they bound themselves and their constituents by the sacred ties of virtue honour and love of their country to observe till their grievances were redressed in their address to the people of greatbritain they complimented them for having at every hazard maintained their independence and transmitted the rights of man and the blessings of liberty to their posterity and requested them not to be surprised that they who were descended from the same common ancestors should refuse to surrender their rights liberties and constitution they proceeded to state their rights and their grievances and to vindicate themselves from the charges of being seditious impatient of government and desirous of independency they summed up their wishes in the following words place us in the same situation that we were at the close of the last     war and our former harmony will be restored in the memorial of congress to the inhabitants of the british colonies they recapitulated the proceedings of greatbritain against them since the year      in order to impress them with a belief that a deliberate system was formed for abridging their liberties they then proceeded to state the measures they had adopted to counteract this system and gave the reasons which induced them to adopt the same they encouraged them to submit to the inconveniences of nonimportation and nonexportation by desiring them to weigh in the opposite balance the endless miseries they and their descendants must endure from an established arbitrary power       they concluded with informing them that the schemes agitated against the colonies had been so conducted as to render it prudent     to extend their views to mournful events and to be in all respects prepared for every contingency in the petition of congress to the king they begged leave to lay their grievances before the throne after a particular enumeration of these they observed that they wholly arose from a destructive system of colony administration adopted since the conclusion of the last war they assured his majesty that they had made such provision for defraying the charges of the administration of justice and the support of civil government as had been judged just and suitable to their respective circumstances and that for the defence protection and security of the colonies their militia would be fully sufficient in time of peace and in case of war they were ready and willing when constitutionally required to exert their most strenuous efforts in granting supplies and raising forces they said we ask but for peace liberty and safety we wish not a diminution of the prerogative nor do we solicit the grant of any new right in our favour your royal authority over us and our connexion with greatbritain we shall always carefully and zealously endeavour to support and maintain they then solicited for a redress of their grievances which they had enumerated and appealing to that being who searches thoroughly the hearts of his creatures they solemnly professed that their counsels had been influenced by no other motives than a dread of impending destruction they concluded with imploring his majesty for the honor of almighty god for his own glory for the interests of his family for the safety of his kingdoms and dominions that as the loving father of his whole people connected by the same bonds of law loyalty faith and blood though dwelling in various countries he would not suffer the transcendent relation formed by these ties to be farther violated by uncertain expectation of effects that if attained never could compensate for the calamities through which they must be gained the congress also addressed the french inhabitants of canada in this they stated the right they had on becoming english subjects to the benefits of the english     constitution       they explained what these rights were and pointed out the difference between the constitution imposed on them by act of parliament and that to which as british subjects they were entitled they introduced their countryman montesquieu as reprobating their parliamentary constitution and exhorting them to join their fellow colonists in support of their common rights they earnestly invited them to join with the other colonies in one social compact formed on the generous principles of equal liberty and to this end recommended that they would chuse delegates to represent them in congress     all these addresses were written with uncommon ability coming from the heart they were calculated to move it inspired by a love of liberty and roused by a sense of common danger the patriots of that day spoke wrote and acted with an animation unknown in times of public tranquility but it was not so much on the probable effect of these addresses that congress founded their hopes of obtaining a redress of their grievances as on the consequences which they expected from the operation of their nonimportation and nonexportation agreement the success that had followed the adoption of a measure similar to the former in two preceding instances had encouraged the colonists to expect much from a repetition of it they indulged in extravagant opinions of the importance of their trade to greatbritain the measure of a nonexportation of their commodities was a new expedient and from that even more was expected than from the nonimportation agreement they supposed that it would produce such extensive distress among the merchants and manufacturers of greatbritain and especially among the inhabitants of the british westindia islands as would induce their general cooperation in procuring a redress of american grievances events proved that young nations like young people are prone to over rate their own importance october    congress having finished all this important business in less than eight weeks dissolved themselves after giving their opinion that another congress should be held on the  0th of may next ensuing at philadelphia unless     the redress of their grievances should be previously obtained       and recommended to all the colonies to chuse deputies as soon as possible to be ready to attend at that time and place should events make their meeting necessary on the publication of the proceedings of congress the people obtained that information which they desired zealous to do something for their country they patiently waited for the decision of that body to whose direction they had resigned themselves their determinations were no sooner known than they were cheerfully obeyed though their power was only advisory yet their recommendations were more generally and more effectually carried into execution than the laws of the best regulated states every individual felt his liberties endangered and was impressed with an idea that his safety     consisted in union a common interest in warding off a common danger proved a powerful incentive to the most implicit submission provincial congresses and subordinate committees were every where instituted the resolutions of the continental congress were sanctioned with the universal approbation of these new representative bodies and institutions were formed under their direction to carry them into effect the regular constitutional assemblies also gave their assent to the measures recommended the assembly of newyork was the only legislature which withheld its approbation their metropolis had long been head quarters of the british army in the colonies and many of their best families were connected with people of influence in greatbritain the unequal distribution of their land fostered an aristocratic spirit from the operation of these and other causes the party for royal government was both more numerous and respectable in newyork than in any of the other colonies the assembly of pennsylvania though composed of a majority of quakers or of those who were friendly to their interests was the first legal body of representatives that ratified unanimously the acts of the general congress       they not only voted their approbation of what that     body had done but appointed members to represent them in the new congress proposed to be held on the  0th day of may next ensuing and took sundry steps to put the province in a posture of defence to relieve the distresses of the people of boston liberal collections were made throughout the colonies and forwarded for the supply of their immediate necessities domestic manufactures were encouraged that the wants of the inhabitants from the nonimportation agreement might be diminished and the greatest zeal was discovered by a large majority of the people to comply with the determinations of these new made representative bodies in this manner while the forms of the old government subsisted a new and independent authority was virtually established it was so universally the sense of the people that the public good required a compliance with the recommendations of congress that any man who discovered an anxiety about the continuance of trade and business was considered as a selfish individual preferring private interest to the good of his     country under the influence of these principles the intemperate zeal of the populace transported them frequently so far beyond the limits of moderation as to apply singular punishments to particular persons who contravened the general sense of the community the british ministry were not less disappointed than mortified at this unexpected combination of the colonies they had flattered themselves with a belief that the malcontents in boston were a small party headed by a few factious men and that the majority of the inhabitants would arrange themselves on the side of government as soon as they found greatbritain determined to support her authority and should even massachusetts take part with its offending capital they could not believe that the other colonies would make a common cause in supporting so intemperate a colony but should even that expectation fail they conceived that their association must be founded on principles so adverse to the interests and feelings of individuals that it could not be of long duration       they were encouraged in these ill founded opinions by     the recollection that the colonies were frequently quarrelling about boundaries clashing in interest differing in policy manners customs forms of government and religion and under the influence of a variety of local prejudices jealousies and aversions they also remembered the obstacles which prevented the colonies from acting together in the execution of schemes planned for their own defence in the late war against the french and indians the failure of the expected cooperation of the colonies in one uniform system at that time was not only urged by the british ministry as a reason for parliamentary control over the whole but flattered them with a delusive hope that they never could be brought to combine their counsels and their arms perhaps the colonists apprehended more danger from british encroachments on their liberties than from french encroachment on indian territories in their neighbourhood or more probably the time to part being come the governor of the universe by a secret influence on their minds disposed them to union from whatever cause it proceeded it is certain that a disposition to do to suffer and to accommodate spread from breast to breast and from colony to colony beyond the reach of human calculation it seemed as though one mind inspired the whole the merchants put far behind them the gains of trade     and cheerfully submitted to a total stoppage of business in obedience to the recommendations of men invested with no legislative powers the cultivators of the soil with great unanimity assented to the determination that the hard earned produce of their farms should remain unshipped although in case of a free exportation many would have been eager to have purchased it from them at advanced prices the sons and daughters of ease renounced imported conveniences and voluntarily engaged to eat drink and wear only such articles as their country afforded these sacrifices were made not from the pressure of present distress but on the generous principle of sympathy with an invaded sister colony and the prudent policy of guarding against a precedent which might in a future day operate against their liberties          this season of universal distress exhibited a striking proof how practicable it is for mankind to sacrifice ease pleasure and interest when the mind is strongly excited by its passions in the midst of their sufferings cheerfulness appeared in the face of all the people they counted every thing cheap in comparison with liberty and readily gave up whatever tended to endanger it a noble strain of generosity and mutual support was generally excited a great and powerful diffusion of public spirit took place the animation of the times raised the actors in these scenes above themselves and excited them to deeds of self denial which the interested prudence of calmer seasons can scarcely credit     history of the american revolution  chapter v fpage    lpage    chapter v transactions in greatbritain in consequence of the proceedings of congress in      some time before the proceedings of congress reached england it was justly apprehended that a nonimportation agreement would be one of the measures they would adopt the ministry apprehending that this event by distressing the trading and manufacturing towns might influence votes against the court in the election of a new parliament which was of course to come on in the succeeding year suddenly dissolved the parliament and immediately ordered a new one to be chosen it was their design to have the whole business of elections over before the inconveniences of a nonimportation agreement could be felt the nation was thus surprised into an election without knowing that the late american acts had driven the colonies into a firm combination to support and make a common cause with the people of massachusetts a new parliament     was returned which met in thirtyfour days after the proceedings of congress were first published in philadelphia and before they were known in greatbritain       this for the most part consisted either of the former members or of those who held similar sentiments     on the  0th of november the king in his speech to his new parliament informed them that a most daring spirit of resistance and disobedience to the laws unhappily prevailed in the province of massachusetts and had broke forth in fresh violences of a very criminal nature and that these proceedings had been countenanced and encouraged in his other colonies and unwarrantable attempts had been made to obstruct the commerce of his kingdoms by unlawful combinations and that he had taken such measures and given such orders as he judged most proper and effectual for carrying into execution the laws which were passed in the last session of the late parliament relative to the province of massachusetts an address which was proposed in the house of commons in answer to this speech produced a warm debate the minister was reminded of the great effects he had predicted from the late american acts they were to humble that whole continent without further trouble and the punishment of boston was to strike so universal a panic on all the colonies that it would be totally abandoned and instead of obtaining relief a dread of the same fate would awe the other provinces to a most respectful submission an address reechoing the royal speech was nevertheless carried by a great majority a similar address was carried after a spirited debate in the upper house but the lords richmond portland rockingham stamford stanhope torrington ponsonby wycombe and camden entered a protest against it which concluded with these remarkable words whatever may be the mischievous designs or the inconsiderate temerity which leads others to this desperate course we wish to be known as persons who have disapproved of measures so injurious in their past effects and future tendency and who are not in haste without enquiry or information to commit ourselves in declarations which may precipitate our country into all the calamities of a civil war     soon after the meeting of the new parliament the proceedings of the congress reached greatbritain       the first impression made by them was in favour of     america administration seemed to be staggered and their opposers triumphed in the eventual truth of their prediction that an universal confederacy to resist greatbritain would be the consequence of the late american acts the secretary of state after a days perusal during which a council was held said that the petition of congress to the king was a decent and proper one he also cheerfully undertook to present it and afterwards reported that his majesty was pleased very graciously to receive it and to promise to lay it before his two houses of parliament from these favourable circumstances the sanguine friends of america concluded that it was intended to make the petition the foundation of a change of measures but these hopes were of short duration the warmer partisans of administration placed so much confidence in the efficacy of the measures they had lately taken to bring the americans to obedience that they regarded the boldest resolutions of congress as the idle clamors of an unruly multitude which proper exertions on the part of greatbritain would speedily silence so much had been asserted and contradicted by both parties that the bulk of the people could form no certain opinion on the subject the parliament adjourned for the christmas holidays without coming to any decision on american affairs       as soon as they met in january a number of papers containing information were laid before them these were mostly letters from governors and other servants of his majesty which detailed the opposition of the colonists in language calculated to give a bad impression of their past conduct and an alarming one of their future intentions it was a circumstance unfavourable to the lovers of peace that the rulers of greatbritain received almost the whole of their american intelligence from those who had an interest in deceiving them governors judges revenueofficers and other royal servants being both appointed and paid by greatbritain fancied that zeal for the interest of that country would be the most likely way to ensure their farther promotion they were therefore     in their official dispatches to government often tempted to abuse the colonists with a view of magnifying their own watchfulness and recommending themselves to greatbritain the plain simple language of truth was not acceptable to courtly ears ministers received and caressed those and those only whose representations coincided with their own views and wishes they who contended that by the spirit of the english constitution british subjects residing on one side of the atlantic were entitled to equal privileges with those who resided on the other were unnoticed while the abettors of ministerial measures were heard with attention jan  0 in this hour of national infatuation lord chatham after a long retirement resumed his seat in the house of lords and exerted his unrivalled eloquence in sundry attempts to dissuade his countrymen from attempting to subdue the americans by force of arms the native dignity of his superior genius and the recollection of his important services entitled him to distinguished notice his language voice and gesture were calculated to force conviction on his hearers though venerable for his age he spoke with the fire of youth he introduced himself with some general observations on the importance of the american quarrel he enlarged on the dangerous events that were coming on the nation in consequence of the present dispute he arraigned the conduct of ministers with great severity and reprobated their whole system of american politics and moved that an humble address be presented to his majesty most humbly to advise and beseech him to dispatch orders to general gage to remove his majestys forces from the town of boston his lordship supported this motion in a pathetic animated speech but it was rejected by a great majority from this and other circumstances it soon became evident that the americans could expect no more favour from the new parliament than they had experienced from the late one       a majority in both houses was against them and resolved to compel them to obedience but a respectable minority in their favour was strongly seconded by petitions from the merchants and manufacturers   0 throughout the kingdom and particularly by those of london and bristol as these were well apprised of the consequences that must follow from a prosecution of coercive measures and deeply interested in the event they made uncommon exertions to prevent their adoption they circumstantially pointed out the various evils that would result from them and faithfully warned their countrymen of the danger to which their commercial interests were exposed when the petition from the merchants of london was read in the     house of commons it was moved to refer it to the committee appointed to take into consideration the american papers but it was moved by way of amendment on the ministerial side that it should be referred to a separate committee to meet on the   th the day succeeding that appointed for the consideration of american papers this though a dishonorable evasion was carried by a majority of more than two to one a similar fate attended the petitions from bristol glasgow norwich liverpool manchester birmingham woolverhampton dudley and some other places these on their being presented were in like manner consigned to what the opposition humorously termed the committee of oblivion about the same time a petition was offered from mr bollan dr franklin and mr lee stating that they were authorized by congress to present their petition to the king which his majesty had referred to that house and that they were enabled to throw great light on the subject and praying to be heard at the bar in support of the said petition the friends of the ministry alledged that as congress was not a legal body nothing could be received from them it was in vain replied that the congress however illegal as to other purposes was sufficiently legal for presenting a petition and that as it was signed by the individual members of congress it might be received as a petition from individuals that the signers of it were persons of great influence in america and it was the right of all subjects to have their petitions heard          in the course of the debate on lord chathams motion for addressing his majesty to withdraw his troops from boston it had been observed by some lords in administration that it was common and easy to censure their measures but those who did so proposed nothing better feb  st  lord chatham answered that he should not be one of those idle censurers that he had thought long and closely upon the subject and purposed soon to lay before their lordships the result of his meditations in a plan for healing the differences between greatbritain and the colonies and for restoring peace to the empire when he had matured his plan he introduced it into the house in the form of a bill for settling the troubles in america in this he proposed that the colonists should make a full acknowledgement of   0 the supremacy of the legislature and the superintending power of the british parliament the bill did not absolutely decide on the right of taxation but partly as a matter of grace and partly as a compromise declared and enacted that no tollage tax or other charge should be levied in america except by common consent in their provincial assemblies it asserted the right of the king to send a legal army to any part of his dominions at all times but declared that no military force could ever be lawfully employed to violate or destroy the just rights of the people it also legalised the holding a congress in the ensuing may for the double purpose of recognising the supreme legislative authority and superintending power of parliament over the colonies and for making a free grant to the king his heirs and successors of a certain and perpetual revenue subject to the disposition of parliament and applicable to the alleviation of the national debt on these conditions the bill proposed to restrain the powers of the admiralty courts to their ancient limits and suspended for a limited time those acts which had been complained of by congress it proposed to place the judges in america on the same footing as to the holding of their salaries and offices with those in england and secured to the colonies all the privileges franchises and immunities granted by their several charters and constitutions       his lordship introduced this     plan with a speech in which he explained and supported every part of it when he sat down lord dartmouth rose and said it contained matter of such magnitude as to require consideration and therefore hoped that the noble earl did not expect their lordships to decide upon it by an immediate vote but would be willing it should lie on the table for consideration lord chatham answered that he expected no more but lord sandwich rose and in a petulant speech opposed its being received at all and gave his opinion that it ought immediately to be rejected with the contempt it deserved that he could not believe it to be the production of any british peer—that it appeared to him rather the work of some american and turning his face towards dr franklin who was leaning on the bar said he fancied he had in his eye the person who drew it up one of the bitterest and most mischievous enemies this country had ever known this turned the eyes of many lords on the insulted american who with that self     command which is peculiar to great minds kept his countenance unmoved several other lords of the administration gave their sentiments also for rejecting lord chathams conciliatory bill urging that it not only gave a sanction to the traiterous proceedings of the congress already held but legalised their future meeting they enlarged on the rebellious temper and hostile disposition of the americans and said that though the duty on tea was the pretence the restrictions on their commerce and the hopes of throwing them off were the real motives of their disobedience and that to concede now would be to give up the point forever the dukes of richmond and manchester lord camden lord lyttleton and others were for receiving lord chathams conciliatory bill—some from approbation of its principles but others only from a regard to the character and dignity of the house      lord dartmouth who from indecision rarely had any will or judgment of his own and who with dispositions for the best measures could be easily prevailed upon to join in support of the worst finding the opposition from     his coadjutors in administration unexpectedly strong turned round and gave his voice with them for immediately rejecting the plan lord chatham in reply to lord sandwich declared the bill proposed by him to be entirely his own but he made no scruple to declare that if he were the first minister of the country and had the care of settling this momentous business he should not be ashamed of publicly calling to his assistance a person so perfectly acquainted with the whole of the american affairs as the gentleman alluded to and so injuriously reflected upon dr franklin one whom all europe held in high estimation for his knowledge and wisdom and ranked with her boyles and her newtons—who was an honour not only to the english nation but to human nature the plan proposed by lord chatham was rejected by a majority of    to    and without being admitted to lie on the table that a bill on so important a subject offered by one of the first men of the age and who as prime minister of the nation had but a few years before taken up greatbritain when in the lowest despondency and conducted her to victory and glory through a war with two of the     most powerful kingdoms of europe should be rejected without any consideration or even a second reading was not only a breach of decency but a departure from that propriety of conduct which should mark the proceedings of a branch of the national legislature it could not but strike every thinking american that such legislators influenced by passion prejudice and party spirit many of whom were totally ignorant of the subject and who would not give themselves an opportunity by a second reading or farther consideration to inform themselves better were very unfit to exercise unlimited supremacy over three millions of virtuous sensible people inhabiting the other side of the globe on the day after the rejection of lord chathams bill a petition was presented to the house of commons from the planters of the sugar colonies residing in greatbritain and the merchants of london trading to the colonies       in this they stated that the british property in     the westindia islands amounted to upwards of  0 millions and that a further property of many millions was employed in the commerce created by the said islands and that the profits and produce of these immense capitals which ultimately centered in greatbritain would be deranged and endangered by the continuance of the american troubles the petitioners were on the   th of the next month admitted to a hearing when mr glover as their agent ably demonstrated the folly and danger of persevering in the contest but without any effect the immediate coercion of the colonies was resolved upon and the ministry would not suffer themselves to be diverted from its execution they were confident of success if they could once bring the controversy to the decision of arms they expected more from conquest than they could promise themselves by negotiation or compromise the free constitutions of the colonies and their rapid progress in population were beheld with a jealous eye as the natural means of independence they conceived the most effectual method of retaining them long would be to reduce them soon they hoped to be able to extinguish remonstrance and debate by such a speedy and decisive conquest as would give them an opportunity to new model the colonial constitutions on such principles as would have prevented future altercations on the subject of their chartered rights every representation that tended to retard or obstruct the coercion of the colonies was therefore considered as     tending only to prolong the controversy confident of victory and believing that nothing short of it would restore the peace of the empire the ministry turned a deaf ear to all petitions and representations they even presumed that the petitioners when they found greatbritain determined on war would assist in carrying it on with vigour in order to expedite the settlement of the dispute       they took it for granted that when the petitioning towns were convinced that a renewal of the commercial intercourse between the two countries would be sooner obtained by going on than turning back that the same interest which led them at first to petition would lead them afterwards to support coercive     measures as the most effectual and shortest way of securing commerce from all future interruptions the determination of ministers to persevere was also forwarded by hopes of the defection of newyork from her sister colonies they flattered themselves that when one link of the continental chain gave way it would be easy to make an impression on the disjointed extremities every attempt to close the breach which had been opened by the former parliament having failed and the ministry having made up their minds on the mode of proceeding with the colonists their proposed plan was briefly unfolded this was to send a greater force to america and to bring in a temporary act to put a stop to all the foreign trade of the new england colonies till they should make proper submissions and acknowledgments an address to his majesty was at the same time moved for to beseech him to take the most effectual measures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the supreme legislature truly critical was that moment to the union of the empire a new parliament might without the charge of inconsistency have repealed acts passed by a former one which had been found inconvenient on experiment but pride and passion under the specious names of national dignity and zeal for the supremacy of parliament induced the adoption of measures for immediately compelling the submission of the colonies the repeal of a few acts of parliament would at this time have satisfied america though she had been extending her claims yet she was still willing that greatbritain should monopolize her trade     and that the parliament should regulate it for the common benefit of the empire nor was she disposed to abridge his majesty of any of his usual prerogatives this authority was sufficient for the mother country to retain the colonists in a profitable state of subordination and yet not so much as to be inconsistent with their claims or the security of their most important interests britain viewed the matter in a different light       to recede at this time would be to acknowledge that the ministry had hitherto been in the     wrong a concession rarely made by private persons but more rarely still by men in public stations the leading members in parliament not distinguishing the opposition of freemen to unconstitutional innovations from the turbulence of licentious mobs breaking over the bounds of law and constitution supposed that to redress grievances was to renounce sovereignty this inference in some degree resulted from the broad basis which they had assigned to the claims of the mother country if as was contended on the part of greatbritain they had a right to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever and the power of parliament over them was absolute and unlimited they were precluded from rescinding any act of theirs however oppressive when demanded as a matter of right they were too highly impressed with ideas of their unlimited authority to repeal any of their laws on the principle that they had not a constitutional power to enact them and too unwise to adopt the same measure on the ground of political expediency unfortunately for both countries two opinions were generally believed neither of which was perhaps true in its utmost extent and one of which was most assuredly false the ministry and parliament of england proceeded on the idea that the claims of the colonists amounted to absolute independence and that a fixed resolution to renounce the sovereignty of greatbritain was concealed under the specious pretext of a redress of grievances the americans on the other hand were equally confident that the mother country not only harboured designs unfriendly to their interests but seriously intended to introduce arbitrary government jealousies of each other were reciprocally indulged to the destruction of all confidence and to the final dismemberment of the empire in discussing the measures proposed by the minister for the coercion of the colonies the whole ground of the american controversy     was traversed       the comparative merits of concession and coercion were placed in every point of view some of the minority in both houses of parliament pointed out the dangers that would attend a war with america—the likelihood of the interference of     other powers—the probability of losing and the impossibility of gaining any thing more than was already possessed on the other hand the friends of the ministry asserted that the americans had been long aiming at independence—that they were magnifying pretended grievances to cover a premeditated revolt—that it was the business and duty of englishmen at every hazard to prevent its completion and to bring them back to a rememberance that their present greatness was owing to the mother country and that even their existence had been purchased at an immense expence of british blood and treasure they acknowledged the danger to be great but said it must be encountered that every days delay increased the evil and that it would be base and cowardly to shift off for the present an unavoidable contest which must fall with accumulated weight on the heads of their posterity the danger of foreign interference was denied and it was contended that an appearance of vigorous measures with a farther reinforcement of troops at boston would be sufficient to quell the disturbances and it was urged that the friends of government were both strong and numerous and only waited for proper support and favourable circumstances to declare themselves after long and warm debates and one or two protests the ministerial plans were carried by great majorities in consequence thereof on the  th of february      a joint address from both lords and commons was presented to his majesty in which they returned thanks for the communication of the papers relative to the state of the british colonies in america and gave it as their opinion that a rebellion actually existed in the province of massachusetts and beseeched his majesty that he would take the most effectual measures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the supreme legislature and begged in the most solemn manner to assure his majesty that it was their fixed resolution at the hazard of their lives and properties to stand by his majesty against all rebellious attempts in the maintenance of the just rights of his majesty and the two houses of parliament              the lords richmond craven archer abergaveny rockingham wycombe courtenay torrington ponsonby cholmondeley abingdon rutland camden effingham stanhope scarborough fitzwilliam and tankerville protested against this address as founded on no proper parliamentary information being introduced by refusing to suffer the presentation of petitions against it though it be the undoubted right of the subject to present the same—as following the rejection of every mode of conciliation—as holding out no substantial offer of redress of grievances and as promising support to those ministers who had inflamed america and grossly misconducted the affairs of greatbritain by the address against which this protest was entered the parliament of greatbritain passed the rubicon in former periods it might be alledged that the claims of the colonies were undefined and that their unanimous resolution to defend them was unknown but after a free representation from twelve provinces had stated their rights and pledged themselves to each other to support them and their determinations were known a resolution that a rebellion actually existed and that at the hazard of their lives and properties they would stand by his majesty against all rebellious attempts was a virtual declaration of war both parties were now bound in consequence of their own acts to submit their controversy to the decision of arms issue was joined by the approbation congress had given to the suffolk resolves and by this subsequent joint address of both houses of parliament to his majesty it is probable that neither party in the beginning intended to go thus far but by the inscrutable operations of providence each was permitted to adopt such measures as not only rent the empire but involved them both with their own consent in all the calamities of a long and bloody war the answer from the throne to the joint address of parliament contained assurances of taking the most speedy and effectual measures for enforcing due obedience to the laws and authority of the supreme legislature       this answer was accompanied with a message to the commons in     which they were informed that some augmentation to the forces by sea and land would be necessary an augmentation of      men to the land forces and of  000 seamen to be employed for the ensuing year was accordingly asked for and     carried without difficulty by the first it was stated that the force at boston would be ten thousand men a number supposed to be sufficient for enforcing the laws other schemes in addition to a military force were thought advisable for promoting the projected coercion of the colonies feb  0  with this view a punishment was proposed so universal in its operation that it was expected the inhabitants of the newengland colonies to obtain a riddance of its heavy pressure would interest themselves in procuring a general submission to parliament lord north moved for leave to bring in a bill to restrain the trade and commerce of the provinces of massachusetts bay and newhampshire the colonies of connecticut and rhodeisland and providence plantations in northamerica to greatbritain ireland and the british islands in the westindies and to prohibit such provinces and colonies from carrying on any fishery on the banks of newfoundland or other places therein to be mentioned under certain conditions and for a limited time the motion for this bill was supported by declaring that as the americans had refused to trade with the mother country they ought not to be permitted to trade with any other it was known that the newengland colonies earned on a circuitous trade and fishing on the banks of newfoundland to a great extent to cut them off from this resource they were legislatively forbidden to fish or to carry on foreign trade it was presumed that the wants of a large body of people deprived of employment would create a clamor in favour of reconciliation the british ministry expected to excite the same temper in the unemployed newengland men that congress meant to raise by the nonimportation agreement among the british merchants and manufacturers the motion for this bill brought into view the whole of the american controversy       the opposers of it said that its cruelty   0 exceeded the examples of hostile rigour with avowed enemies for that in the most dangerous wars the fishing craft was universally spared—they desired the proposer of the bill to recollect that he had often spoken of the multitude of friends he had in those provinces and that now he confounded the innocent with the guilty—friends with enemies and involved his own partizans in one common ruin with his opposers they alledged farther that the bill would operate against the people of greatbritain as the people of new england     were in debt to them and had no other means of paying that debt but through the fishery and the circuitous trade dependent on it it was observed that the fishermen being cut off from employment must turn soldiers and that therefore while they were provoking the americans to resistance by one set of acts they were furnishing them with the means of recruiting an army by another the favourers of the bill denied the charge of severity alledging that the colonists could not complain of any distress the bill might bring on them as they not only deserved it but had set the example that they had entered into lawful combinations to ruin the merchants and manufacturers of greatbritain it was said that if any foreign power had offered a similar insult or injury the whole nation would have demanded satisfaction they contended that it was a bill of humanity and mercy for said they the colonists have incurred all the penalties of rebellion and are liable to the severest military execution instead of inflicting the extent of what they deserved the bill only proposes to bring them to their senses by restricting their trade they urged farther that the measure was necessary for said they the americans have frequently imposed on us by threatening to withdraw their trade hoping through mercantile influence to bend the legislature to their demands—that this was the third time they had thrown the commerce of greatbritain into a state of confusion that both colonies and commerce were better lost than preserved on such terms they added farther that they must either relinquish their connexion with america or fix it on such a basis as would prevent     a return of these evils       they admitted the bill to be coercive but said that the coercion which put the speediest end to the dispute was eventually the most merciful in the progress of the bill a petition from the merchants and traders of london who were interested in the american commerce was presented against it they were heard by their agent mr david barclay and a variety of witnesses were examined before the house in the course of their evidence it appeared that in the year      the four provinces of newengland employed in their several fisheries no less than     0 ton of shipping and  00  men and that the produce of their fisheries that year in foreign markets amounted to      0£   s sterling it also appeared that the fisheries had very   0 much increased since that time—that all the materials used in them except salt and the timber of which the vessels were built were purchased from greatbritain and that the net proceeds of the whole were remitted thither all this information was disregarded march  0  after much opposition in both houses and a protest in the house of lords the bill was by a great majority finally ratified so intent was the ministry and parliament on the coercion of the colonists that every other interest was sacrificed to its accomplishment they conceived the question between the two countries to be simply whether they should abandon their claims and at once give up all the advantages arising from sovereignty and commerce or resort to violent measures for their security since the year      when a secretary of state officially disclaimed all views of an american revenue little mention had been made of that subject but the decided majority which voted with the ministry on this occasion emboldened lord north once more to present it to the view of his countrymen he therefore brought into parliament a scheme which had the double recommendation of holding forth the semblance of conciliation and the prospect of an easement of british taxes by a productive revenue from the colonies this was a resolution which passed on the  0th of february          resolved that when the governor council and assembly or general court of any of his majestys provinces or colonies in america shall propose to make provision according to the condition circumstances and situations of such province or colony for contributing their proportion for the common defence such proportion to be raised under the authority of the general court or general assembly of such province or colony and disposable by parliament and shall engage to make provision also for the support of the civil government and the administration of justice in such province or colony it will be proper if such proposal shall be approved by his majesty and the two houses of parliament and for so long as such provision shall be made accordingly to forbear in respect of such province or colony to levy any duty tax or assessment except only such duties as it may be expedient to continue to levy or to impose for the regulation of commerce the net produce of the duties last mentioned to be carried to the account of such province or colony respectively     this was introduced by the minister in a long speech in which he asserted that it would be an infallible touch stone to try the americans if said he their opposition is only founded on the principles which they pretend they must agree with this proposition but if they have designs in contemplation different from those they avow their refusal will convict them of duplicity the oppositions to the ministers motion originated among those who had supported him in previous questions they objected to the proposal that in effect it was an acknowledgment of something grievous in the idea of taxing america by parliament and that it was therefore a departure from their own principles they contended that it was improper to make concessions to rebels with arms in their hands or to enter into any measures for a settlement with the americans in which they did not as a preliminary acknowledge the supremacy of parliament       the minister was likely to be deserted by some of his partizans till others explained the consistency of the scheme with their former declarations     it was asked what shall parliament lose by acceding to this resolution not the right of taxing america for this is most expressly reserved not the profitable exercise of this right for it proposed to enforce the only essential part of taxation by compelling the americans to raise not only what they but what we think reasonable we are not going to war for trifles and a vain point of honor but for substantial revenue the minister farther declared that he did not expect his proposition to be generally relished by the americans but said he if it does no good in the colonies it will do good here it will unite the people of england by holding out to them a distinct object of revenue he added farther as it tends to unite england it is likely to disunite america for if only one province accepts the offer their confederacy which only makes them formidable will be broken the opposers of ministry attacked the proposition with the combined force of wit and argument they animadverted on the inconsistency of holding forth the same resolution as a measure of concession and as an assertion of authority they remarked that hitherto it had been constantly denied that they had any contest about an american revenue—that the whole had been a dispute about obedience to tradelaws and the general legislative authority     of parliament but now ministers suddenly changed their language and proposed to interest the nation—console the manufacturers and animate the soldiery by persuading them that it is not a contest for empty honour but for the acquisition of a substantial revenue it was said that the americans would be as effectually taxed without their consent by being compelled to pay a gross sum as by an aggregate of small duties to the same amount that this scheme of taxation exceeded in oppression any that the rapacity of mankind had hitherto devised in other cases a specific sum was demanded and the people might reasonably presume that the remainder was their own but here they were wholly in the dark as to the extent of the demand      this proposition however for conciliation though illy     relished by many of the friends of ministry was carried on a division of     to    on its transmission to the colonies it did not produce the effects of disunion expected from it it was unanimously rejected the reason for this cannot be expressed better than in the act of congress on that subject which after a recital of the said conciliatory motion proceeded in the following words the congress took the said resolution into consideration and are thereupon of opinion that the colonies of america are entitled to the sole and exclusive privilege of giving and granting their own money that this involves a right of deliberating whether they will make any gift for what purposes it shall be made and what shall be its amount and that it is a high breach of this privilege for any body of men extraneous to their constitutions to prescribe the purposes for which money shall be levied on them to take to themselves the authority of judging of their conditions circumstances and situations and of determining the amount of the contribution to be levied that as the colonies possess a right of appropriating their gifts so are they entitled at all times to enquire into their application to see that they be not wasted among the venal and corrupt for the purpose of undermining the civil rights of the givers nor yet be diverted to the support of standing armies inconsistent with their freedom and subversive of their quiet to propose therefore as this resolution does that the monies given by the colonies shall be subject to the disposal of parliament alone is to propose that they shall relinquish this right of     enquiry and put it in the power of others to render their gifts ruinous in proportion as they are liberal that this privilege of giving or of withholding our monies is an important barrier against the undue exertion of prerogative which if left altogether without controul may be exercised to our great oppression and all history shews how efficacious is its intercession for redress of grievances and reestablishment of rights and how improvident it would be to part with so powerful a mediator      we are of opinion that the proposition contained in     this resolution is unreasonable and insidious unreasonable because if we declare we accede to it we declare without reservation we will purchase the favour of parliament not knowing at the same time at what price they will please to estimate their favour it is insidious because individual colonies having bid and bidden again till they find the avidity of the seller too great for all their powers to satisfy are then to return into opposition divided from their sister colonies whom the minister will have previously detached by a grant of easier terms or by an artful procrastination of a definitive answer that the suspension of the exercise of their pretended power of taxation being expressly made commensurate with the continuance of our gifts these must be perpetual to make that so whereas no experience has shewn that a gift of perpetual revenue secures a perpetual return of duty or of kind disposition on the contrary the parliament itself wisely attentive to this observation are in the established practice of granting their supplies from year to year only desirous and determined as we are to consider in the most dispassionate view every seeming advance towards a reconciliation made by the british parliament let our brethren of britain reflect what would have been the sacrifice to men of free spirits had even fair terms been proffered as these insidious proposals were with circumstances of insult and defiance a proposition to give our money accompanied with large fleets and armies seems addressed to our fears rather than to our freedom with what patience would britons have received articles of treaty from any power on earth when born on the point of a bayonet by military plenipotentiaries we think the attempt unnecessary to raise upon us by force or by threats our proportional contributions to the common defence when all know and themselves acknowledge we have fully contributed whenever called upon to do so in the character of freemen we are of opinion it is not just that the colonies should be required     to oblige themselves to other contributions while greatbritain possesses a monopoly of their trade           this of itself lays them under heavy contribution to demand therefore additional aids in the form of a tax is to demand the double of their equal proportion if we are to contribute equally with the other parts of the empire let us equally with them enjoy free commerce with the whole world but while the restrictions on our trade shut to us the resources of wealth is it just we should bear all other burthens equally with those to whom every resource is open we conceive that the british parliament has no right to intermeddle with our provisions for the support of civil government or administration of justice the provisions we have made are such as please ourselves and are agreeable to our own circumstances they answer the substantial purposes of government and of justice and other purposes than these should not be answered we do not mean that our people shall be burthened with oppressive taxes to provide sinecures for the idle or the wicked under colour of providing for a civil list while parliament pursue their plan of civil government within their own jurisdiction we also hope to pursue ours without molestation we are of opinion the proposition is altogether unsatisfactory because it imports only a suspension of the mode not a renunciation of the pretended right to tax us because too it does not propose to repeal the several acts of parliament passed for the purposes of restraining the trade and altering the form of government of one of our colonies extending the boundaries and changing the government of quebec enlarging the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty and viceadmiralty taking from us the rights of a trial by jury of the vicinage in cases affecting both life and property transporting us into other countries to be tried for criminal offences exempting by mocktrial the murderers of colonists from punishment and quartering soldiers on us in times of profound peace nor do they renounce the power of suspending our own legislatures and for legislating for us themselves in all cases whatsoever on the contrary to shew they mean no discontinuance of injury they pass acts at the very     time of holding out this proposition for restraining the commerce and fisheries of the provinces of newengland and for interdicting the trade of other colonies with all foreign nations and with each other this proves unequivocally they mean not to relinquish the exercise of indiscriminate legislation over us upon the whole this proposition seems to have been held up to the world to deceive it into a belief that there was nothing in dispute     between us but the mode of levying taxes and that the parliament having now been so good as to give up this the colonies are unreasonable if not perfectly satisfied whereas in truth our adversaries still claim a right of demanding ad libitum and of taxing us themselves to the full amount of their demand if we do comply with it this leaves us without any thing we can call property but what is of more importance and what in this proposal they keep out of sight as if no such point was now in contest between us they claim a right to alter our charters and establish laws and leave us without any security for our lives or liberties the proposition seems also to have been calculated more particularly to lull into fatal security our well affected fellow subjects on the other side of the water till time should be given for the operation of those arms which a british minister pronounced would instantaneously reduce the cowardly sons of america to unreserved submission but when the world reflects how inadequate to justice are these vaunted terms when it attends to the rapid and bold succession of injuries which during a course of eleven years have been aimed at these colonies when it reviews the pacific and respectful expostulations which during that whole time were the sole arms we opposed to them when it observes that our complaints were either not heard at all or were answered with new and accumulated injuries when it recollects that the minister himself on an early occasion declared that he would never treat with america till he had brought her to his feet and that an avowed partisan of ministry has more lately denounced against us the dreadful sentence delenda est carthago that this was done     in presence of a british senate and being unreproved by them       must be taken to be their own sentiment especially as the purpose has already in part been carried into execution by their treatment of boston and burning of charlestown when it considers the great armaments with which they have invaded us and the circumstances of cruelty with which these have commenced and prosecuted hostilities when these things we say are laid together and attentively considered can the world be deceived into an opinion that we are unreasonable or can it hesitate to believe with us that nothing but our own exertions may defeat the ministerial sentence of death or abject submission other plans for conciliation with the colonies founded on principles very different from those which were the basis of lord norths conciliatory motion were brought forward in the house of commons     but without receiving its approbation march     the most remarkable of these was proposed by mr edmund burke in a speech which for strength of argument extent of information and sublimity of language would bear a comparison with the most finished performance that ancient or modern times have produced in his introduction to this admirable speech he examined and explained the natural and accidental circumstances of the colonies with respect to situation resources number population commerce fisheries and agriculture and from those considerations shewed their importance he then enquired into their unconquerable spirit of freedom and he traced it to its original sources from these circumstances he inferred the line of policy which should be pursued with regard to america—he shewed that all proper plans of government must be adapted to the feelings established habits and received opinions of the people on these principles he reprobated all plans of governing the colonies by force and proposed as the ground work of his plan that the colonists should be admitted to an interest in the constitution       he then went into an historical detail of the manner in which british privileges had been extended to ireland wales and the counties palatine of chester and durham—the     state of confusion previously to that event—and the happy consequences which followed it he contended that a communication to the members of an interest in the constitution was the great ruling principle of british government he therefore proposed to go back to the old policy for governing the colonies he was for a parliamentary acknowledgment of the legal competency of the colony assemblies for the support of their government in peace and for public aids in time of war—and of the futility of parliamentary taxation as a method of supply he stated that much had been given in the old way of colonial grant that from the year      to      the journals of the house of commons repeatedly acknowledged that the colonies not only gave but gave to satiety and that from the time in which parliamentary imposition had superseded the free gifts of the provinces there was much discontent but little revenue he therefore moved six resolutions affirmatory of these facts and grounded on them resolutions for repealing the acts complained of by the americans trusting to the liberality of their future voluntary contributions this plan of conciliation which     promised immediate peace to the whole empire and a lasting obedience of the colonies though recommended by the charms of the most persuasive eloquence and supported by the most convincing arguments was by a great majority rejected march    mr d hartley not discouraged by the negative which had been given to mr burkes scheme came forward with another for the same purpose this proposed that a letter of requisition should be sent to the colonies by a secretary of state on a motion from the house for a contribution to the expences of the whole empire he meant to leave to the provincial assemblies the right to judge of the expedience of the grant—its amount and application in confidence that the colonies would give freely when called on in this constitutional way he moved to suspend the acts complained of by the americans this was also rejected another plan which shall be more particularly explained was digested in private by dr franklin on the part of the americans and dr fothergill and david   0 barclay on behalf of the british ministry       there appeared a disposition to concede some thing considerable on both sides but the whole came to nothing in consequence of an inflexible determination to refuse a repeal of the act of parliament for altering the chartered government of massachusetts dr franklin agreed that the tea destroyed should be paid for—the british ministers that the boston port act should be repealed but the latter contended that the late massachusetts acts being real amendments of their constitution must for that reason be continued as well as to be a standing example of the power of parliament on the other hand it was declared by dr franklin that while the parliament claimed and exercised a power of internal legislation for the colonies and of altering american constitutions at pleasure there could be no agreement as that would render the americans unsafe in every privilege they enjoyed and would leave them nothing in which they could be secure this obstinate adherence to support parliament in a power of altering the laws and charters of the provinces particularly to enforce their late laws for new modelling the chartered constitution of massachusetts was the fatal rock by dashing on which the empire broke in twain for every other point in dispute between the two countries seemed in a fair way for an amicable compromise     the fishery bill was speedily followed by another for restraining the trade and commerce of the colonies and provinces of newjersey pennsylvania maryland virginia and southcarolina the reasons assigned for this were the same with those offered for the other these provinces had adopted the continental association the british minister thought it proper that as they had voluntarily interdicted themselves from trade with greatbritain ireland and the westindies they should be restrained from it with all other parts of the world he contended that the inhabitants of the colonies might render this act a dead letter by relinquishing their own resolutions as then they would meet with no restraint in carrying on trade in its ancient legal channel       it is remarkable that three of the associated colonies viz newyork     delaware and northcarolina were omitted in this restraining bill whatever might be the view of the british ministry for this discrimination it was considered in the colonies as calculated to promote disunion among them it is certain that the colonies which were exempted from its operation might have reaped a golden harvest from the exemption in their favour had they been disposed to avail themselves of it but such was the temper of the times that a renunciation of immediate advantage in favour of the public was fashionable the selfish passions which in seasons of peace are too often the cause of quarrels were hushed by the pressure of common danger the exempted colonies spurned the proffered favour and submitted to the restraints imposed on their less favoured neighbours so as to be equal sharers of their fate the indulgence granted to newyork in being kept out of this restraining bill was considered by some as a premium for her superior loyalty her assembly had refused to approve the proceedings of the congress and had in some other instances discovered less warmth than the neighbouring legislatures much was expected from her moderation at the very time the british parliament was framing the restraining acts just mentioned the constitutional assembly of newyork petitioned the british parliament for a redress of their grievances great stress had been laid on the circumstance that congress was not a legal assembly and the want of constitutional sanction had been assigned as a reason for the neglect with which their petition had been treated much praise had been lavished on the colony of newyork     for its moderation and occasion had been taken from their refusing to approve the proceedings of the congress to represent the resolutions and claims of that body to be more the ebullitions of incendiaries than the sober sentiments of the temperate citizens       it was both unexpected and confounding to those who supported these opinions that the representation and remonstrance of the very loyal assembly of newyork stated that an exemption from internal taxation and the exclusive right of providing for their own civil government and the administration of justice in     the colony were esteemed by them as their undoubted and unalienable rights a motion being made in the house of commons for bringing up this representation and remonstrance of the assembly of newyork it was amended on the suggestion of lord north by adding in which the assembly claim to themselves rights derogatory to and inconsistent with the legislative authority of parliament as declared by the declaratory act the question so amended being put it passed in the negative the fate of this representation extinguished the hopes of those moderate persons both in the parent state and the colonies who flattered themselves that the disputes subsisting between the two countries might be accommodated by the mediation of the constitutional assemblies two conclusions were drawn from this transaction both of which were unfriendly to a reconciliation the decided language with which the loyal assembly of newyork claimed exemption from parliamentary taxation proved to the people of greatbritain that the colonists however they might differ in modes of opposition or in degrees of warmth were nevertheless united in that fundamental principle the rejection of their representation proved that nothing more was to be expected from proceeding in the constitutional channel of the legal assemblies than from the new system of a continental congress solid revenue and unlimited supremacy were the objects of greatbritain and exemption from parliamentary taxation that of the most moderate of the colonies so wide were the claims of the two countries from each other that to reconcile them on any middle ground seemed to be impossible   0 history of the american

daily increasing the enlightened and liberal who loved peace and the extension of human happiness saw with regret the approaching horrors of a civil war and wished to avert them with these views dr fothergill mr david barclay and dr franklin held sundry conferences in london on american affairs the two former were english gentlemen of most amiable characters and highly esteemed by the british

reading this paper a second time dr franklin gave his reasons at length for each article some of his reasons were as follows on the first article he observed that when the tea was destroyed at boston greatbritain had a right to reparation and would certainly have had it on demand as was the case when injuries were done by mobs in the time of the stamp act or she might have a right to return an equal injury if she rather chose to do that but greatbritain could not have a right both to reparation and to return an equal injury much less had she a right to return the injury ten or twenty fold as she had done by blocking up the port of boston all which extra injury ought to be repaired by greatbritain that therefore if paying for the tea was agreed to as an article fit to be proposed it was merely from a desire of peace and in compliance with the opinions of dr fothergill and david barclay expressed at their first meeting that this was indispensible that the dignity of greatbritain required it and that if this was agreed to every thing else would be easy     on the second it was observed that the tea duty act should be repealed as having never answered any good purpose as having been the cause of the present mischief and never likely to be executed that the act being considered as unconstitutional by the americans and what parliament had no right to enact they must consider all the money extorted by it as so much wrongfully taken and of which therefore restitution ought to be made and the rather as it would furnish a fund out of which the tea destroyed would be best defrayed      on the third and fourth articles it was observed that the americans were frequently charged with views of abolishing     the navigation act but that in truth those parts of it which were of most importance to britain as tending to increase its naval strength were as acceptable to the colonists as they could be to the inhabitants of the parent state since they wished to employ their own ships in preference to those of foreigners and they had no desire to see foreign ships enter their ports that it would prevent disputes if they were reenacted in the colonies as that would demonstrate their consent to them and then if all the duties arising on them were to be collected by officers appointed and paid in the respective governments and the produce paid into their treasuries the acts would be better and more faithfully executed and at much less expence and a great source of misunderstanding between the two countries removed—that the extension of the admiralty jurisdiction so much complained of would then no longer be necessary in support of the  th article it was observed that if every distinct part of the kings dominions supported its own government in time of peace it was all that could justly be required of it that all the other confederated colonies had done so from their beginning that their taxes for that purpose were very considerable that new countries had many expences which old ones were free from the work being done to their land by their ancestors such as making roads and bridges erecting churches courthouses forts quays and other public buildings founding schools and places of education hospitals and almshouses—that the voluntary subscriptions and legal taxes for such purposes taken together amounted to more than was paid by equal estates in greatbritain that it would be best not to take money from the americans as a contribution to its public expence     in time of peace first for that just so much less would be got from them in commerce and secondly that coming into the hands of british ministers accustomed to prodigality of public money it would be squandered and dissipated without answering any general good purposes       that on the whole it would be best for both countries that no aids should be asked from the colonies in time of peace     that it would then be their interest to grant bountifully and exert themselves in time of war the sooner to put an end to it in support of the  th article it was said that if the king could bring into any one part of his dominions troops raised in any other part of them without the consent of the legislature of the part to which they were brought he might bring armies raised in america to england without the consent of parliament the  th article was drawn in compliance with an idea of dr fothergill that the british government would probably not be satisfied with the promise of voluntary grants in time of war from the american assemblies of which the quantity must be uncertain that therefore it would be best to proportion them in some way to the shilling in the pound raised in england in support of the  0th article was urged the injustice of seizing that fortress which had been built at an immense charge by the province for the defence of their port against national enemies and turning it into a citadel for awing the town restraining their trade blocking up their port and depriving them of their privileges that a great deal had been said of their injustice in destroying the tea but here was a much greater injustice uncompensated that castle having cost the province £ 00000 in support of the   th article it was said that as the americans had assisted in the conquest of canada at a great expence of blood and treasure they had some right to be considered in the settlement of it that the establishing an arbitrary government on the bank of their settlements would be dangerous to them all that as to amending the massachusetts government though it might be shewn that every one of these pretended amendments were real mischiefs yet that as charters were compacts between two parties the king and the people no alteration could be made in them even for the better but by the consent of both parties that the parliamentary claim and     exercise of power to alter american charters had rendered all their constitutions uncertain and set them     quite afloat       that by this claim of altering laws and charters at will they deprived the colonists of all rights and privileges whatever but what they should hold at their pleasure that this was a situation they could not be in and must risque life and every thing rather than submit to it the   th article was explained by stating the former situation of the judges in most of the colonies viz that they were appointed by the crown and paid by the assemblies that the appointment being during the pleasure of the crown the salary had been during the pleasure of the assembly that when it was urged against the assemblies that their making judges dependent on them for their salaries was aiming at an undue influence over the courts of justice the assemblies usually replied that making them dependent on the crown for continuance in their places was also retaining an undue influence over those courts and that one undue influence was a proper balance for another but that whenever the crown would consent to the appointment of judges only during good behaviour the assemblies would at the same time grant their salaries to be permanent during their continuance in office that instead of agreeing to this equitable offer the crown now claimed to make the judges in the colonies dependant on its favour for place as well as salary and both to be continued at its pleasure this the colonies must oppose as inequitable as putting both the weights into one of the scales of justice in favour of the    th it was urged that the governors sent to the colonies were often men of no estate or principle who came merely to make fortunes and had no natural regard for the country they were to govern that to make them quite independent of the people was to make them careless of their conduct and giving a loose to their rapacious and oppressive dispositions that the dependence of the governors on the people for their salaries could never operate to the prejudice of the kings service or to the disadvantage of britain since each governor was bound by a particular set of instructions which he had given surety to observe and all the laws he assented     to were subject to be repealed by the crown       that the payment of the salaries by the people was more satisfactory to them and was productive of a good understanding between governors and governed     and that therefore the innovations lately made at boston and newyork should be laid aside the   th article was expunged on the representation of dr fothergill and david barclay that the monopoly of the american commerce would never be given up and that the proposing of it would only give offence without answering any good purpose the   th article was readily agreed to the   th was thought to be of little consequence if the duties were given to the colony treasuries the   th it was thought could hardly be obtained but it was supported by dr franklin alleging that without it any compact made with the americans might be evaded by acts of the british parliament restraining the intermediate proceedings which were necessary for carrying it into effect this paper of hints was communicated to lord dartmouth by dr fothergill who also stated the arguments which in conversation had been offered in support of them when objections were made to them as being humiliating to greatbritain dr fothergill replied that she had been unjust and ought to bear the consequences and alter her conduct—that the pill might be bitter but it would be salutary and must be swallowed that sooner or later these or similar measures must be followed or the empire would be divided and ruined these hints were handed about amongst ministers and conferences were held on them the result was on the  th of february      communicated to dr franklin in the presence of dr fothergill and david barclay which as far as concerned the leading articles was as follows   the first article was approved   the second agreed to so far as related to the tea act but repayment of the duties that had been collected was refused   the third not approved as it implied a deficiency of power in the parliament that made the acts   0   the fourth approved   the fifth agreed to but with a reserve that no change prejudicial to britain was to be expected   the sixth agreed to so far as related to the appropriation of the     duties but the appointment of the officers and of their salaries to remain as at present   the seventh relating to aids in time of war agreed to   the eighth relating to troops was inadmissible   the ninth could be agreed to with this difference that no proportion should be observed with regard to preceding taxes but each colony should give at pleasure  0 the tenth agreed to as to the restitution of castle william but the restriction on the crown in building fortresses refused    the eleventh refused absolutely except as to the boston port bill which would be repealed and the quebec act might be so far amended as to reduce that province to its ancient limits the other massachusetts acts being real amendments of their constitution must for that reason be continued as well as to be a standing example of the power of parliament    the twelfth agreed to that the judges should be appointed during good behaviour on the assemblies providing permanent salaries such as the crown should approve of    the thirteenth agreed to provided the assemblies make provision as in the preceding article    the fifteenth agreed to    the sixteenth agreed to supposing the duties paid to the colony treasuries    the seventeenth inadmissible at this interview the conversation was shortened by dr franklins observing that while the parliament claimed and exercised a power of internal legislation for the colonies and of altering american constitutions at pleasure there could be no agreement as that would render the americans unsafe in every privilege they enjoyed     and would leave them nothing in which they could be secure       it being hinted how necessary an agreement was for america since it was so easy for britain to burn all her seaport towns dr franklin replied that the chief part of his little property consisted of houses in such towns that they might make bonfires of them whenever they pleased that the fear of losing them would never alter his resolution of resisting     to the last extremity that claim of parliament and that it behoved greatbritain to take care what mischief she did to america for that sooner or later she would certainly be obliged to make good all damages with interest on the   th of february      the three before mentioned gentlemen met when a paper was produced by david barclay entitled a plan which it is believed would produce a permanent union between greatbritain and her colonies this in the first article proposed a repeal of the tea act on payment being made for the tea destroyed dr franklin agreed to the first part but contended that all the other massachusetts acts should also be repealed but this was deemed inadmissible dr franklin declared that the people of massachusetts would suffer all the hazards and mischiefs of war rather than admit the alteration of their charters and laws by parliament he was for securing the unity of the empire by recognising the sanctity of charters and by leaving the provinces to govern themselves in their internal concerns but the british ministry could not brook the idea of relinquishing their claim to internal legislation for the colonies and especially to alter and amend their charters the first was for communicating the vital principles of liberty to the provinces but the latter though disposed to redress a few of their existing grievances would by no means consent to a repeal of the late act of parliament for altering the chartered government of massachusetts and least of all to renounce all claim to future amendments of charters or of internal legislation for the colonies      dr franklin laboured hard to prevent the breach from becoming irreparable and candidly stated the outlines     of a compact which he supposed would procure a durable union of the two countries but his well meant endeavors proved abortive and in the mean time he was abused as the fomenter of those disturbances which he was anxiously endeavouring to prevent that the ministry might have some opening to proceed upon and some salvo for their personal honor he was disposed to engage that pecuniary compensation should be made for the tea destroyed but he would not give up essential liberty for the purpose of procuring temporary safety finding the ministry bent on war unless the colonists would consent     to hold their rights liberties and charters at the discretion of a british parliament and well knowing that his countrymen would hazard every thing rather than consent to terms so degrading as well as inconsistent with the spirit of the british constitution he quitted greatbritain in march      and returned to philadelphia dr fothergill his worthy coadjutor in the great business of peace wrote to him on the evening before he left london that whatever specious pretences were offered they were all hollow and that to get a larger field on which to fatten a herd of worthless parasites was all that was intended with this conviction founded on personal observations as well as the testimony of his esteemed friend who in the course of his daily visits among the great in the practice of his profession had an opportunity of knowing their undisguised sentiments dr franklin joined his countrymen and exerted his great abilities in conducting them through a war he had in vain laboured to prevent   0 history of the american revolution  chapter vi fpage  0 lpage    chapter vi consequences in america resulting from the preceding transactions of parliament and of the commencement of hostilities the year      terminated in america with an expectation that a few months would bring them a redress of their grievances but the probability of that event     daily diminished       the colonists had indulged themselves in an expectation that the people of greatbritain from a consideration of the dangers and difficulties of a war with their colonies would in their election have preferred those who were friends to peace and a reconciliation but when they were convinced of the fallacy of these hopes they turned their attention to the means of self defence it had been the resolution of many never to submit to the operation of the late acts of parliament their number daily increased and in the same proportion that greatbritain determined to enforce did they determine to oppose intelligence of the rejection of lord chathams bill of the address of both     houses of parliament to the king of the  th of february and of the fishery bill all arrived among the colonists about the same time and diminished what remained of their first hopes of a speedy accommodation the fishery bill excited a variety of emotions the obvious tendency of it was to starve thousands the severity of it did not strike an englishman for he viewed it as a merited correction for great provincial offences but it appeared in the blackest colours to an american who felt no consciousness of guilt and who fancied that heaven approved his zeal in defence of liberty it alienated the affections of the colonists and produced in the breasts of thousands a hatred of greatbritain the penal acts of parliament in      were all levelled against massachusetts but the fishery bill extended to newhampshire connecticut and rhodeisland the reasons assigned for this by lord north were that they had aided and abetted their offending neighbours and were so near to them that the intentions of parliament would be frustrated unless they were in like manner comprehended in the proposed restraints the extension of this penal statute to three additional provinces operated powerfully in favour of union and convinced the most moderate of the increasing necessity for all the provinces to make a common cause of their opposition whatever might be the designs of parliament their acts had a natural tendency to enlarge the demands of the americans     and to cement their confederacy by firm principles of union       at first they only claimed exemption from internal taxation but by the combination of the eastindia company and the british ministry an external tax was made to answer all the purposes of a direct internal tax they therefore in consistence with their own principles were constrained to deny the right of taxing in any form for a supply nothing could more contribute to make the colonists deny the parliamentary claim of internal legislation than the manner in which it was exercised in depriving them of their charters and passing an act relative to trials which promised indemnity to murderers this convinced them that an opposition to so injurious a claim was essentially necessary to their security but they still admitted the power of parliament to bind their trade this was conceded by congress but a few months before an act passed that they should have no foreign trade nor be     allowed to fish on their own coasts the british ministry by their successive acts impelled the colonists to believe that while the mother country retained any authority over them that authority would in some shape or other be exerted so as to answer all the purposes of a power to tax while greatbritain stretched that portion of controlling supremacy which the colonists were disposed to allow her to such an extent as covered oppression equally grievous with that which they would not allow the way was fast opening for a total renunciation of her sovereignty the coercive measures adopted by the parent state produced a disposition in the colonies to extend their claims and the extension of their claims produced an increasing disposition in greatbritain to coerce them still more the jealousy of liberty on one side and the desire of supremacy on the other were reciprocally cause and effect and urged both parties the one to rise in their demands and the other to enforce submission in the contest between greatbritain and her colonies there had been a fatal progression from small to greater grounds of dissention the trifling tax of  d per pound on tea roused the jealous inhabitants of boston to throw   0 chests of it into the ocean           this provoked the british parliament to shut up their port and to new model their charter statutes so unconstitutional and alarming excited a combination in twelve of the colonies to stop all trade with greatbritain ireland and the westindies their combination gave birth to the restraining acts of parliament by which nine of the colonies were interdicted all other trade but that from which they had voluntarily excluded themselves and four of these nine were farther devoted to famine by being forbidden to fish on their coasts each new resolution on the one side and new act on the other reciprocally gave birth to something from the opposite party that was more irritating or oppressive than what had preceded the beginning of strife between the parent state and her colonies was like the letting out of waters from inconsiderable causes love was changed into suspicion that gradually ripened into ill will and soon ended in hostility prudence policy and reciprocal interest urged the expediency of concession but pride false honour and misconceived dignity drew in an opposite direction undecided claims and doubtful rights which under the influence of wisdom and     humility might have been easily compromised imperceptibly widened into an irreconcileable breach hatred at length took the place of kind affections and the calamities of war were substituted in lieu of the benefits of commerce from the year      in which a military force had been stationed in boston there was a constant succession of insulting words looks and gestures the inhabitants were exasperated against the soldiers and they against the inhabitants the former looked on the latter as the instruments of tyranny and the latter on the former as seditious rioters or fraudulent smugglers in this irritable state every incident however trifling made a sensible impression the citizens apprehended constant danger from an armed force in whose power they were the soldiers on the other hand considered themselves as in the midst of enemies and exposed to attacks from within and from without       in proportion     as the breach between greatbritain and her colonies widened the distrust and animosity between the people and the army increased from the latter end of      hostile appearances daily threatened that the flames of war would be kindled from the collision of such inflammable materials whatsoever was done by either party by way of precaution for the purposes of self defence was construed by the other as preparatory to an intended attack each disclaimed all intentions of commencing hostilities but reciprocally manifested suspicion of the others sincerity as far as was practicable without an open rupture the plans of the one were respectively thwarted by the other from every appearance it became daily more evident that arms must ultimately decide the contest to suffer an army that was soon expected to be an enemy quietly to fortify themselves when the inhabitants were both able and willing to cut them off appeared to some warm spirits the height of folly but the prudence and moderation of others and especially the advice and recommendation of congress restrained their impetuosity it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonies that the royal army was posted in newengland the people of that northern country have their passions more under the command of reason and interest than in the southern latitudes where a warmer sun excites a greater degree of irascibility one rash offensive action against the royal forces at this early period though successful might have done great     mischief to the cause of america it would have lost them european friends and weakened the disposition of the other colonies to assist them the patient and the politic newengland men fully sensible of their situation submitted to many insults and bridled their resentment in civil wars or revolutions it is a matter of much consequence who strikes the first blow the compassion of the world is in favour of the attacked and the displeasure of good men on those who are the first to imbrue their hands in human blood for the space of nine months after the arrival of general gage the behaviour of the people of boston is particularly worthy of imitation by those who wish to     overturn established governments       they conducted their opposition with exquisite address they avoided every kind of outrage and violence preserved peace and good order among themselves successfully engaged the other colonies to make a common cause with them and counteracted general gage so effectually as to prevent his doing any thing for his royal master while by patience and moderation they skreened themselves from censure though resolved to bear as long as prudence and policy dictated they were all the time preparing for the last extremity they were furnishing themselves with arms and ammunition and training their militia provisions were also collected and stored in different places particularly at concord about  0 miles from boston general gage though zealous for his royal masters interest discovered a prevailing desire after a peaceable accommodation he wished to prevent hostilities by depriving the inhabitants of the means necessary for carrying them on with this view he determined to destroy the stores which he knew were collected for the support of a provincial army wishing to accomplish this without bloodshed he took every precaution to effect it by surprise and without alarming the country april     at eleven oclock at night  00 grenadiers and light infantry the flower of the royal army embarked at the common landed at phippss farm and marched for concord under the command of lieutenant colonel smith neither the secrecy with which this expedition was planned—the privacy with which the troops marched out nor an order that no one inhabitant should leave boston were sufficient to prevent intelligence from being sent to the country militia of what     was going on about two in the morning   0 of the lexington militia had assembled to oppose them but the air being chilly and intelligence respecting the regulars uncertain they were dismissed with orders to appear again at beat of drum   th  they collected a second time to the number of  0 between   and   oclock in the morning and the british regulars soon after made their appearance major pitcairn who led the advanced corps rode up to them and called out disperse you     rebels throw down your arms and disperse       they still continued in a body on which he advanced nearer—discharged his pistol—and ordered his soldiers to fire this was done with a huzza a dispersion of the militia was the consequence but the firing of the regulars was nevertheless continued individuals finding they were fired upon though dispersing returned the fire three or four of the militia were killed on the green a few more were shot after they had begun to disperse the royal detachment proceeded on to concord and executed their commission they disabled two    pounders—threw  00 lb of ball into rivers and wells and broke in pieces about  0 barrels of flour mr john butterick of concord major of a minute regiment not knowing what had passed at lexington ordered his men not to give the first fire that they might not be the aggressors upon his approaching near the regulars they fired and killed captain isaac davis and one private of the provincial minute men the fire was returned and a skirmish ensued the kings troops having done their business began their retreat towards boston this was conducted with expedition for the adjacent inhabitants had assembled in arms and began to attack them in every direction in their return to lexington they were exceedingly annoyed both by those who pressed on their rear and others who pouring in from all sides fired from behind stone walls and such like coverts which supplied the place of lines and redoubts at lexington the regulars were joined by a detachment of  00 men under lord piercy which had been sent out by general gage to support lieutenant colonel smith this reinforcement having two pieces of cannon awed the provincials and kept them at a greater distance but they continued a constant though irregular and scattering fire which did great execution the close firing from behind the walls by good marksmen put the regular troops in no small     confusion but they nevertheless kept up a brisk retreating fire on the militia and minute men       a little after sunset the regulars reached bunkershill worn down with excessive fatigue having marched that day between thirty and forty miles on     the next day they crossed charlestown ferry and returned to boston there never were more than  00 provincials engaged at one time and often not so many as some tired and gave out others came up and took their places there was scarcely any discipline observed among them officers and privates fired when they were ready and saw a royal uniform without waiting for the word of command their knowledge of the country enabled them to gain opportunities by crossing fields and fences and to act as flanking parties against the kings troops who kept to the main road the regulars had    killed   0 wounded and    made prisoners of the provincials  0 were killed and    wounded and missing as arms were to decide the controversy it was fortunate for the americans that the first blood was drawn in newengland the inhabitants of that country are so connected with each other by descent manners religion politics and a general equality that the killing of a single individual interested the whole and made them consider it as a common cause the blood of those who were killed at lexington and concord proved the firm cement of an extensive union april    to prevent the people within boston from cooperating with their countrymen without in case of an assault which was now daily expected general gage agreed with a committee of the town that upon the inhabitants lodging their arms in faneuilhall or any other convenient place under the care of the selectmen all such inhabitants as were inclined might depart from the town with their families and effects in five days after the ratification of this agreement the inhabitants had lodged      fire arms     pistols     bayonets and    blunderbusses the agreement was well observed in the beginning but after a short time obstructions were thrown in the way of its final completion on the plea that persons who went from boston to bring in the goods of those who chose to continue within the town were not properly treated congress remonstrated on the infraction of   0 the agreement but without effect the general on a farther     consideration of the consequences of moving the whigs out of boston evaded it in a manner not consistent with good faith he was in some measure compelled to adopt this dishonourable measure from the clamor of the tories who alleged that none but enemies to the british government were disposed to remove and that when they were all safe with their families and effects the town would be set on fire to prevent the provincials from obtaining supplies which they much wanted a quibble was made on the meaning of the word effects which was construed by the general as not including merchandize by this construction unwarranted by every rule of genuine interpretation many who quitted the town were deprived of their usual resources for a support passports were not universally refused but were given out very slowly and the business was so conducted that families were divided—wives were separated from their husbands children from their parents and the aged and infirm from their relations and friends the general discovered a disinclination to part with the women and children thinking that on their account the provincials would be restrained from making an assault on the town the selectmen gave repeated assurances that the inhabitants had delivered up their arms but as a cover for violating the agreement general gage issued a proclamation in which he asserted that he had full proof to the contrary a few might have secreted some favourite arms but nearly all the training arms were delivered up on this flimsy pretence the general sacrificed his honour to policy and the clamors of the tories contrary to good faith he detained many though fairly entitled by agreement to go out and when he admitted the departure of others he would not allow them to remove their families and effects the provincial congress of massachusetts which was in session at the time of the lexington battle dispatched an account of it to greatbritain accompanied with many depositions to prove that the british troops were the aggressors       they also made an address to the inhabitants     of greatbritain in which after complaining of their sufferings they say these have not yet detached us from our royal sovereign we profess to be his loyal and dutiful subjects and though hardly dealt with as we have been are still ready with our lives and fortunes to defend his person crown and dignity nevertheless     to the persecution and tyranny of his evil ministry we will not tamely submit appealing to heaven for the justice of our cause we determine to die or be free from the commencement of hostilities the dispute between greatbritain and the colonies took a new direction intelligence that the british troops had marched out of boston into the country on some hostile purpose being forwarded by expresses from one committee to another great bodies of the militia not only from massachusetts but the adjacent colonies grasped their arms and marched to oppose them the colonies were in such a state of irritability that the least shock in any part was by a powerful and sympathetic affection instantaneously felt throughout the whole the americans who fell were revered by their countrymen as martyrs who had died in the cause of liberty resentment against the british burned more strongly than ever martial rage took possession of the breasts of thousands combinations were formed and associations subscribed binding the inhabitants to one another by the sacred ties of honour religion and love of country to do whatever their public bodies directed for the preservation of their liberties hitherto the americans had no regular army from principles of policy they cautiously avoided that measure least they might subject themselves to the charge of being aggressors all their military regulations were carried on by their militia and under the old established laws of the land for the defence of the colonies the inhabitants had been from their early years enrolled in companies and taught the use of arms the laws for this purpose had never been better observed than for some months previous to the lexington battle       these military arrangements which had been previously adopted for defending the colonies from hostile french and indians     were on this occasion turned against the troops of the parent state forts magazines and arsenals by the constitution of the country were in the keeping of his majesty immediately after the lexington battle these were for the most part taken possession of throughout the colonies by parties of the provincial militia ticonderoga in which was a small royal garrison was surprised and taken by adventurers from different states public money which had been collected in consequence of previous grants was also seized for common services before the     commencement of hostilities these measures would have been condemned by the moderate even among the americans but that event justified a bolder line of opposition than had been adopted sundry citizens having been put to death by british troops self preservation dictated measures which if adopted under other circumstances would have disunited the colonists one of the most important of this kind was the raising an army men of warm tempers whose courage exceeded their prudence had for months urged the necessity of raising troops but they were restrained by the more moderate who wished that the colonies might avoid extremities or at least that they might not lead in bringing them on the provincial congress of massachusetts being in session at the time the battle of lexington was fought voted that an army of  0000 men be immediately raised that    00 be of their own province and that a letter and delegate be sent to the several colonies of newhampshire connecticut and rhode island in consequence of this vote the business of recruiting was begun and in a short time a provincial army was paraded in the vicinity of boston which though far below what had been voted by the provincial congress was much superior in numbers to the royal army the command of this force was given to general ward      had the british troops confined themselves to boston as before the   th of april the assembling an american army though only for the purpose of observation and defence would have appeared in the nature of a challenge and would have made many less willing to support     the people of massachusetts but after the british had commenced hostilities the same measure was adopted without subjecting the authors of it to censure and without giving offence or hazarding the union the lexington battle not only furnished the americans with a justifying apology for raising an army but inspired them with ideas of their own prowess amidst the most animated declarations of sacrificing fortune and risquing life itself for the security of american rights a secret sigh would frequently escape from the breasts of her most determined friends for fear that they could not stand before the bravery and discipline of british troops hoary sages would shake their heads and say your cause is good and i wish you success but i fear that your undisciplined valour must be overcome in the unequal contest after a few thousands of   0 you have fallen the provinces must ultimately bow to that power which has so repeatedly humbled france and spain so confident were the british of their superiority in arms that they seemed desirous that the contest might be brought to a military decision some of the distinguished speakers in parliament had publicly asserted that the natives of america had nothing of the soldier in them and that they were in no respect qualified to face a british army european philosophers had published theories setting forth that not only vegetables and beasts but that even men degenerated in the western hemisphere departing from the spirit of true philosophy they overlooked the state of society in a new world and charged a comparative inferiority on every production that was american the colonists themselves had imbibed opinions from their forefathers that no people on earth were equal to those with whom they were about to contend impressed with high ideas of british superiority and dissident of themselves their best informed citizens though willing to run all risques feared the consequence of an appeal to arms the success that attended their first military enterprize in some degree banished these suggestions perhaps in no subsequent battle did the americans appear to greater advantage than in their first essay at lexington       it is almost without parallel     in military history for the yeomanry of the country to come forward in a single disjointed manner without order and for the most part without officers and by an irregular fire to put to flight troops equal in discipline to any in the world in opposition to the bold assertions of some and the desponding fears of others experience proved that americans might effectually resist british troops the dissident grew bold in their countrys cause and indulged in chearful hopes that heaven would finally crown their labours with success soon after the lexington battle and in consequence of that event not only the arms ammunition forts and fortifications in the colonies were secured for the use of the provincials but regular forces were raised and money struck for their support these military arrangements were not confined to the newengland states but were general throughout the colonies the determination of the king and parliament to enforce submission to their acts and the news of the lexington battle came to the distant provinces nearly about the     same time it was supposed by many that the latter was in consequence of the former and that general gage had recent orders to proceed immediately to subdue the refractory colonists from a variety of circumstances the americans had good reason to conclude that hostilities would soon be carried on vigorously in massachusetts and also to apprehend that sooner or later each province would be the theatre of war the more speedily therefore said they we are prepared for that event the better chance we have for defending ourselves previous to this period or rather to the   th of april      the dispute had been carried on by the pen or at most by associations and legislative acts but from this time forward it was conducted by the sword the crisis was arrived when the colonies had no alternative but either to submit to the mercy or to resist the power of greatbritain an unconquerable love of liberty could not brook the idea of submission while reason more temperate in her decisions suggested to the people their insufficiency to make effectual opposition       they were fully apprized of the power     of britain—they knew that her fleets covered the ocean and that her flag had waved in triumph through the four quarters of the globe but the animated language of the time was it is better to die freemen than to live slaves though the justice of their cause and the inspiration of liberty gave in the opinion of disinterested judges a superiority to the writings of americans yet in the latter mode of conducting their opposition the candid among themselves acknowledged an inferiority their form of government was deficient in that decision dispatch and coercion which are necessary to military operations europeans from their being generally unacquainted with fire arms are less easily taught the use of them than americans who are from their youth familiar with these instruments of war yet on other accounts they are more susceptible of military habits the proportion of necessitous men in the new world is small to that in the old to procure subsistence is a powerful motive with an european to enlist and the prospect of losing it makes him afraid to neglect his duty but these incitements to the punctual discharge of military services are wanting in america in old countries the distinction of ranks and the submission of inferiors to superiors generally takes     place but in the new world an extreme sense of liberty and equality indisposes to that implicit obedience which is the soul of an army the same causes which nurtured a spirit of independence in the colonies were hostile to their military arrangements it was not only from the different state of society in the two countries but from a variety of local causes that the americans were not able to contend in arms on equal terms with their parent state from the first settlement of the british colonies agriculture and commerce but especially the former had been the favourite pursuits of their inhabitants war was a business abhorrent from their usual habits of life they had never engaged in it from their own motion nor in any other mode than as appendages to british troops and under british establishments by these means the military spirit of the colonies had no opportunity of expanding itself       at the commencement of hostilities the british     troops possessed a knowledge of the science and discipline of war which could be acquired only by a long series of application and substantial establishments their equipments their artillery and every other part of their apparatus for war approached perfection to these important circumstances was added a high national spirit of pride which had been greatly augmented by their successes in their last contest with france and spain on the other hand the americans were undisciplined without experienced officers and without the shadow of military establishments in the wars which had been previously carried on in or near the colonies the provincials had been by their respective legislatures frequently added to the british troops but the pride of the latter would not consider the former who were without uniformity of dress or the pertness of military airs to be their equals the provincial troops were therefore for the most part assigned to services which though laborious were not honourable the ignorance of british generals commanding in the woods of america sometimes involved them in difficulties from which they had been more than once relieved by the superior local knowledge of the colonial troops these services were soon forgotten and the moment the troops who performed them could be spared they were disbanded such like obstacles had hitherto depressed military talents in america but they were now overcome by the ardor of the people     in the year      a martial spirit pervaded all ranks of men in the colonies they believed their liberties to be in danger and were generally disposed to risque their lives for their establishment their ignorance of the military art prevented their weighing the chances of war with that exactness of calculation which if indulged might have damped their hopes they conceived that there was little more to do than fight manfully for their country they consoled themselves with the idea that though their first attempt might be unsuccessful their numbers would admit of a repetition of the experiment till the invaders were finally exterminated       not considering     that in modern war the longest purse decides oftener than the longest sword they feared not the wealth of britain they both expected and wished that the whole dispute would be speedily settled in a few decisive engagements elevated with the love of liberty and buoyed above the fear of consequences by an ardent military enthusiasm unabated by calculations about the extent duration or probable issue of the war the people of america seconded the voice of their rulers in an appeal to heaven for the vindication of their rights at the time the colonies adopted these spirited resolutions they possessed not a single ship of war nor so much as an armed vessel of any kind it had often been suggested that their seaport towns lay at the mercy of the navy of greatbritain this was both known and believed but disregarded the love of property was absorbed in the love of liberty the animated votaries of the equal rights of human nature consoled themselves with the idea that though their whole sea coast should be laid in ashes they could retire to the western wilderness and enjoy the luxury of being free on this occasion it was observed in congress by christopher gadsden one of the southcarolina delegates our houses being constructed of brick stone and wood though destroyed may be rebuilt but liberty once gone is lost forever the sober discretion of the present age will more readily censure than admire but can more easily admire than imitate the fervid zeal of the patriots of      who in idea sacrificed property in the cause of liberty with the ease that they now sacrifice almost every other consideration for the acquisition of property the revenues of britain were immense and her people were     habituated to the payment of large sums in every form which contributions to government have assumed but the american colonies possess neither money nor funds nor were their people accustomed to taxes equal to the exigences of war the contest having begun about taxation to have raised money by taxes for carrying it on would have been impolitic       the temper of the times precluded the necessity of attempting the dangerous     expedient for such was the enthusiasm of the day that the colonists gave up both their personal services and their property to the public on the vague promises that they should at a future time be reimbursed without enquiring into the solidity of funds or the precise period of payment the resources of the country were commanded on general assurances that all expences of the war should ultimately be equalised the parent state abounded with experienced statesmen and officers but the dependent form of government exercised in the colonies precluded their citizens from gaining that practical knowledge which is acquired from being at the head of public departments there were very few in the colonies who understood the business of providing for an army and still fewer who had experience and knowledge to direct its operations the disposition of the finances of the country and the most effectual mode of drawing forth its resources were subjects with which scarce any of the inhabitants were acquainted arms and ammunition were almost wholly deficient and though the country abounded with the materials of which they are manufactured yet there was neither time nor artists enough to supply an army with the means of defence the country was destitute both of fortifications and engineers amidst so many discouragements there were some flattering circumstances the war could not be carried on by greatbritain but to a great disadvantage and at an immense expence it was easy for ministers at st jamess to plan campaigns but hard was the fate of the officer from whom the execution of them in the woods of america was expected the country was so extensive and abounded so much with defiles that by evacuating and retreating the americans though they could not conquer yet might save themselves from being conquered the authors of the acts of parliament for restraining the trade of the colonies were most excellent recruiting officers for the congress they imposed a necessity on     thousands to become soldiers all other business being suspended the whole resources of the country were applied in supporting an army       though     the colonists were without discipline they possessed native valour though they had neither gold nor silver they possessed a mine in the enthusiasm of their people paper for upwards of two years produced to them more solid advantages than spain derived from her superabounding precious metals though they had no ships to protect their trade or their towns they had simplicity enough to live without the former and enthusiasm enough to risque the latter rather than submit to the power of britain they believed their cause to be just and that heaven approved their exertions in defence of their rights zeal originating from such motives supplied the place of discipline and inspired a confidence and military ardor which overleaped all difficulties resistance being resolved upon by americans—the pulpit—the press—the bench and the bar severally laboured to unite and encourage them the clergy of newengland were a numerous learned and respectable body who had a great ascendancy over the minds of their hearers they connected religion and patriotism and in their sermons and prayers represented the cause of america as the cause of heaven the synod of newyork and philadelphia also sent forth a pastoral letter which was publicly read in their churches this earnestly recommended such sentiments and conduct as were suitable to their situation writers and printers followed in the rear of the preachers and next to them had the greatest hand in animating their countrymen gentlemen of the bench and of the bar denied the charge of rebellion and justified the resistance of the colonists a destinction founded on law between the king and his ministry was introduced the former it was contended could do no wrong the crime of treason was charged on the latter for using the royal name to varnish their own unconstitutional measures the phrase of a ministerial war became common and was used as a medium for reconciling resistance with allegiance coeval with the resolutions for organizing an army was one appointing the  0th day of july      a day of public humiliation fasting and prayer to almighty god  00 to bless their rightful sovereign king george and to inspire him with wisdom to discern     and pursue the true interest of his subjects and that the british nation might be influenced to regard the things that belonged to her peace before they were hid from her eyes—that the colonies might be ever under the care and protection of a kind providence and be prospered in all their interests—that america might soon behold a gracious interposition of heaven for the redress of her many grievances the restoration of her invaded rights a reconciliation with the parent state on terms constitutional and honourable to both the forces which had been collected in massachusetts were stationed in convenient places for guarding the country from farther excursions of the regulars from boston breast works were also erected in different places for the same purpose while both parties were attempting to carry off stock from the several islands with which the bay of boston is agreeably diversified sundry skirmishes took place these were of real service to the americans they habituated them to danger and perhaps much of the courage of old soldiers is derived from an experimental conviction that the chance of escaping unhurt from engagements is much greater than young recruits suppose about the latter end of may a great part of the reinforcements ordered from greatbritain arrived at boston may     three british generals howe burgoyne and clinton whose behaviour in the preceding war had gained them great reputation also arrived about the same time general gage thus reinforced prepared for acting with more decision but before he proceeded to extremities he conceived it due to ancient forms to issue a proclamation holding forth to the inhabitants the alternative of peace or war june     he therefore offered pardon in the kings name to all who should forthwith lay down their arms and return to their respective occupations and peaceable duties excepting only from the benefit of that pardon samuel adams and john hancock whose offences were said to be of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other consideration than that of condign punishment       he also  0  proclaimed that not only the persons above named and excepted but also their adherents associates and correspondents should be deemed guilty of treason and rebellion and treated accordingly by this proclamation it was also declared that as the courts of judicature were shut martial law should take place till a due course of justice should be reestablished it was supposed that     this proclamation was a prelude to hostilities and preparations were accordingly made by the americans a considerable height by the name of bunkershill just at the entrance of the peninsula of charlestown was so situated as to make the possession of it a matter of great consequence to either of the contending parties june     orders were therefore issued by the provincial commanders that a detachment of a thousand men should intrench upon this height by some mistake breedshill high and large like the other but situated nearer boston was marked out for the intrenchments instead of bunkershill the provincials proceeded to breedshill and worked with so much diligence that between midnight and the dawn of the morning they had thrown up a small redoubt about   rods square they kept such a profound silence that they were not heard by the british on board their vessels though very near these having derived their first information of what was going on from the sight of the work near completion began an incessant firing upon them the provincials bore this with firmness and though they were only young soldiers continued to labour till they had thrown up a small breastwork extending from the east side of the redoubt to the bottom of the hill as this eminence overlooked boston general gage thought it necessary to drive the provincials from it june     about noon therefore he detached major general howe and brig general pigot with the flower of his army consisting of four battalions ten companies of the grenadiers and ten of light infantry with a proportion of field artillery to effect this business these troops landed at moretons point and formed after landing but remained in that position till they were reinforced by a second detachment of light infantry and grenadier companies a battalion of land forces and a battalion of marines  0  making in the whole nearly  000 men       while the troops who first landed were waiting for this reinforcement the provincials for their farther security pulled up some adjoining post and rail fences and set them down in two parallel lines at a small distance from each other and filled the space between with hay which having been lately mowed remained on the adjacent ground the kings troops formed in two lines and advanced slowly to give their artillery time to demolish the american works while the british were advancing to the attack they received orders to burn charlestown     this was not done because they were fired upon from the houses in that town but from the military policy of depriving enemies of a cover in their approaches in a short time this ancient town consisting of about  00 buildings chiefly of wood was in one great blaze the lofty steeple of the meeting house formed a pyramid of fire above the rest and struck the astonished eyes of numerous beholders with a magnificent but awful spectacle in boston the heights of every kind were covered with the citizens and such of the kings troops as were not on duty the hills around the adjacent country which afforded a safe and distinct view were occupied by the inhabitants of the country thousands both within and without boston were anxious spectators of the bloody scene the honour of british troops beat high in the breasts of many while others with a keener sensibility felt for the liberties of a great and growing country the british moved on but slowly which gave the provincials a better opportunity for taking aim the latter in general reserved themselves till their adversaries were within ten or twelve rods but then began a furious discharge of small arms the stream of the american fire was so incessant and did so great execution that the kings troops retreated in disorder and precipitation their officers rallied them and pushed them forward with their swords but they returned to the attack with great reluctance the americans again reserved their fire till their adversaries were near and then put them a second time to flight       general howe and the officers redoubled their exertions and were again  0  successful though the soldiers discovered a great aversion to going on by this time the powder of the americans began so far to fail that they were not able to keep up the same brisk fire as before the british also brought some cannon to bear which raked the inside of the breast work from end to end the fire from the ships batteries and field artillery was redoubled—the soldiers in the rear were goaded on by their officers the redoubt was attacked on three sides at once under these circumstances a retreat from it was ordered but the provincials delayed and made resistance with their discharged muskets as if they had been clubs so long that the kings troops who easily mounted the works had half filled the redoubt before it was given up to them     while these operations were going on at the breast work and redoubt the british light infantry were attempting to force the left point of the former that they might take the american line in flank though they exhibited the most undaunted courage they met with an opposition which called for its greatest exertions the provincials here in like manner reserved their fire till their adversaries were near and then poured it upon the light infantry with such an incessant stream and in so true a direction as mowed down their ranks the engagement was kept up on both sides with great resolution the persevering exertions of the kings troops could not compel the americans to retreat till they observed that their main body had left the hill this when begun exposed them to new danger for it could not be effected but by marching over charlestown neck every part of which was raked by the shot of the glasgow man of war and of two floating batteries the incessant fire kept up across this neck prevented any considerable reinforcement from joining their countrymen who were engaged but the few who fell on their retreat over the same ground proved that the apprehensions of those provincial officers who declined passing over to succour their companions were without any solid foundation the number of americans engaged amounted only to   00       it was apprehended that the conquerors would  0  push the advantage they had gained and march immediately to american head quarters at cambridge but they advanced no farther than bunkershill there they threw up works for their own security the provincials did the same on prospecthill in front of them both were guarding against an attack and both were in a bad condition to receive one the loss of the peninsula depressed the spirits of the americans and their great loss of men produced the same effect on the british there have been few battles in modern wars in which all circumstances considered there was a greater destruction of men than in this short engagement the loss of the british as acknowledged by general gage amounted to  0   nineteen commissioned officers were killed and  0 more were wounded the battle of quebec in      which gave greatbritain the province of canada was not so destructive to british officers as this affair of a slight intrenchment the work only of a few hours that the officers suffered so much must be imputed   0 to their being aimed at none of the provincials in this engagement were riflemen but they were all good marksmen the whole of their previous military knowledge had been derived from hunting and the ordinary amusements of sportsmen the dexterity which by long habit they had acquired in hitting beasts birds and marks was fatally applied to the destruction of british officers from their fall much confusion was expected they were therefore particularly singled out most of those who were near the person of general howe were either killed or wounded but the general though he greatly exposed himself was unhurt the light infantry and grenadiers lost threefourths of their men of one company not more than five and of another not more than fourteen escaped the unexpected resistance of the americans was such as wiped away the reproaches of cowardice which had been cast on them by their enemies in britain       the spirited conduct of the british officers merited and obtained great applause but the provincials were justly entitled to a large portion of the same for having made the utmost exertions of their adversaries necessary to dislodge them  0  from lines which were the work only of a single night the americans lost five pieces of cannon their killed amounted to     their wounded and missing to     thirty of the former fell into the hands of the conquerors they particularly regretted the death of general warren to the purest patriotism and most undaunted bravery he added the virtues of domestic life the eloquence of an accomplished orator and the wisdom of an able statesman nothing but a regard to the liberty of his country induced him to oppose the measures of government he aimed not at a separation from but a coalition with the mother country he took an active part in defence of his country not that he might be applauded and rewarded for a patriotic spirit but because he was in the best sense of the word a real patriot having no interested or personal views to answer the friends of liberty confided in his integrity the soundness of his judgment and his abilities as a public speaker enabled him to make a distinguished figure in public councils but his intrepidity and active zeal induced his countrymen to place him in the military line within four days after he was appointed a major general he fell a noble sacrifice to a cause which he had espoused from the purest     principles like hambden he lived and like hambden he died universally beloved and universally regretted his many virtues were celebrated in an elegant eulogium written by dr rush in language equal to the illustrious subject the burning of charlestown though a place of great trade did not discourage the provincials it excited resentment and execration but not any disposition to submit such was the high toned state of the public mind and so great the indifference for property when put in competition with liberty that military conflagrations though they distressed and impoverished had no tendency to subdue the colonists they might answer in the old world but were not calculated for the new where the war was undertaken not for a change of masters but for securing essential rights the action at breedshill or bunkershill as it has been commonly called produced many and very important  0  consequences       it taught the british so much respect for americans intrenched behind works that their subsequent operations were retarded with a caution that wasted away a whole campaign to very little purpose it added to the confidence the americans began to have in their own abilities but inferences very injurious to the future interests of america were drawn from the good conduct of the new troops on that memorable day it inspired some of the leading members of congress with such high ideas of what might be done by militia or men engaged for a short term of enlistment that it was long before they assented to the establishment of a permanent army not distinguishing the continued exertions of an army through a series of years from the gallant efforts of the yeomanry of the country led directly to action they were slow in admitting the necessity of permanent troops they conceived the country might be defended by the occasional exertions of her sons without the expence and danger of an army engaged for the war in the progress of hostilities as will appear in the sequel the militia lost much of their first ardor while leading men in the councils of america trusting to its continuance neglected the proper time of recruiting for a series of years from the want of perseverance in the militia and the want of a disciplined standing army the cause for which arms were at first taken up was more than once brought to the brink of destruction     history of the american revolution  chapter vii fpage    lpage 0  chapter vii the second congress meets and organises a regular continental army—makes sundry public addresses and petitions the king c transactions in massachusetts      it has already been mentioned that congress previous to its dissolution on the   th of october      recommended to the colonies to chuse members for another to meet on the tenth of may      unless the redress of their grievances was previously obtained a circular letter had been addressed by lord dartmouth to the  0  several colonial governors requesting their interference to prevent the meeting of this second congress but ministerial requisitions had lost their influence delegates were elected not only for the twelve colonies that were before represented but also for the parish of st johns in georgia and in july following for the whole province the time of the meeting of this second congress was fixed at so distant a day that an opportunity might be afforded for obtaining information of the plans adopted by the british parliament in the winter of           had these been favourable the delegates would either not have     met or dispersed after a short session but as the resolution was then fixed to compel the submission of the colonies and hostilities had already commenced the meeting of congress on the tenth of may which was at first eventual became fixed may  0 on their meeting they chose peyton randolph for their president and charles thomson for their secretary on the next day mr hancock laid before them a variety of depositions proving that the kings troops were the aggressors in the late battle at lexington together with sundry papers relative to the great events which had lately taken place in massachusetts whereupon congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole to take into consideration the state of america they proceeded in the same line of moderation and firmness which marked the acts of their predecessors in the past year may    the city and county of newyork having applied to congress for advice how they should conduct themselves with regard to the troops expected to land there they were advised to act on the defensive so long as might be consistent with their safety—to permit the troops to remain in the barracks so long as they behaved peaceably but not to suffer fortifications to be erected or any steps to be taken for cutting off the communication between the town and country may     congress also resolved that exportation to all parts of british america which had not adopted their association should immediately cease and that no provision of any kind or other necessaries be furnished to the british fisheries on the american  0  coasts        june   and that no bill of exchange draught or order of any officer in the british army or navy their agents or contractors be received or negociated or any money supplied them by any person in america—that no provisions or necessaries of any kind be furnished or supplied to or for the use of the british army or navy in the colony of massachusetts bay—that no vessel employed in transporting british troops to america or from one part of northamerica to another or warlike stores or provisions for said troops be freighted or furnished with provisions or any necessaries these resolutions may be considered as the counterpart of the british acts for restraining the commerce and prohibiting the fisheries of     the colonies they were calculated to bring distress on the british islands in the westindies whose chief dependence for subsistance was on the importation of provision from the american continent they also occasioned new difficulties in the support of the british army and fisheries the colonists were so much indebted to greatbritain that government bills for the most part found among them a ready market a war in the colonies was therefore made subservient to commerce by increasing the sources of remittance this enabled the mother country in a great degree to supply her troops without shipping money out of the kingdom from the operation of these resolutions advantages of this nature were not only cut off but the supply of the british army rendered both precarious and expensive in consequence of the interdiction of the american fisheries great profits were expected by british adventurers in that line such frequently found it most convenient to obtain supplies in america for carrying on their fisheries but as greatbritain had deprived the colonists of all benefits from that quarter they now in their turn interdicted all supplies from being furnished to british fishermen to obviate this unexpected embarrassment several of the vessels employed in this business were obliged to return home to bring out provisions for their associates these restrictive resolutions were not so much the effect of resentment as of policy       the colonists conceived that  0  by distressing the british commerce they would encrease the number of those who would interest themselves in their behalf the new congress had convened but a few days when their venerable president peyton randolph was under a necessity of returning home on his departure john hancock was unanimously chosen his successor the objects of deliberation presented to this new congress were if possible more important than those which in the preceding year had engaged the attention of their predecessors the colonists had now experienced the inefficacy of those measures from which relief had been formerly obtained they found a new parliament disposed to run all risques in inforcing their submission they also understood that administration was united against them and its members firmly established in their places hostilities were commenced reinforcements had arrived and more were daily     expected added to this they had information that their adversaries had taken measures to secure the friendship and cooperation of the indians and also of the canadians the coercion of the colonies being resolved upon and their conquest supposed to be inevitable the british ministry judged that it would be for the interest of both countries to proceed in that vigorous course which bid fairest for the speediest attainment of their object they hoped by pressing the colonists on all quarters to intimidate opposition and ultimately to lessen the effusion of human blood in this awful crisis congress had but a choice of difficulties the newengland states had already organized an army and blockaded general gage to desert them would have been contrary to plighted faith and to sound policy to support them would make the war general and involve all the provinces in one general promiscuous state of hostility the resolution of the people in favour of the latter was fixed and only wanted public sanction for its operation may     congress therefore resolved that for the express purpose of defending and securing the colonies and preserving them in safety against   0 all attempts to carry the late acts of a parliament into execution by force of arms       they be immediately put in a state of defence but as they wished for a restoration of the harmony formerly subsisting between the mother country and the colonies to the promotion of this most desirable reconciliation an humble and dutiful petition be presented to his majesty to resist and to petition were coeval resolutions as freemen they could not tamely submit but as loyal subjects wishing for peace as far as was compatible with their rights they once more in the character of petitioners humbly stated their grievances to the common father of the empire to dissuade the canadians from cooperating with the british they again addressed them representing the pernicious tendency of the quebec act and apologizing for their taking ticonderoga and crownpoint as measures which were dictated by the great law of self preservation about the same time congress took measures for warding off the danger that threatened their frontier inhabitants from indians commissioners to treat with them were appointed and a supply of goods for their use was ordered a talk was also prepared by congress and     transmitted to them in which the controversy between greatbritain and her colonies was explained in a familiar indian style they were told that they had no concern in the family quarrel and were urged by the ties of ancient friendship and a common birth place to remain at home keep their hatchet buried deep and to join neither side the novel situation of massachusetts made it necessary for the ruling powers of that province to ask the advice of congress on a very interesting subject the taking up and exercising the powers of civil government for many months they had been kept together in tolerable peace and order by the force of ancient habits under the simple style of recommendation and advice from popular bodies invested with no legislative authority but as war now raged in their borders and a numerous army was actually raised some more efficient form of government became necessary       at this early day it neither     comported with the wishes nor the designs of the colonists to erect forms of government independent of greatbritain congress therefore recommended only such regulations as were immediately necessary and these were conformed as near as possible to the spirit and substance of the charter and were only to last till a governor of his majestys appointment would consent to govern the colony according to its charter on the same principles of necessity another assumption of new powers became unavoidable the great intercourse that daily took place throughout the colonies pointed out the propriety of establishing a general postoffice this was accordingly done and dr franklin who had by royal authority been dismissed from a similar employment about three years before was appointed by his country the head of the new department while congress was making arrangements for their proposed continental army it was thought expedient once more to address the inhabitants of greatbritain and to publish to the world a declaration setting forth their reasons for taking up arms—to address the speaker and gentlemen of the assembly of jamaica and the inhabitants of ireland and also to prefer a second humble petition to the king in their address to the inhabitants of greatbritain they again vindicated themselves from the charge of aiming at independency professed their willingness to submit to the several acts of     trade and navigation which were passed before the year      recapitulated their reasons for rejecting lord norths conciliatory motion—stated the hardships they suffered from the operations of the royal army in boston and insinuated the danger the inhabitants of britain would be in of losing their freedom in case their american brethren were subdued in their declaration setting forth the causes and necessity of their taking up arms they enumerated the injuries they had received and the methods taken by the british ministry to compel their submission and then said       we are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers or     resistance by force the latter is our choice we have counted the cost of this contest and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery they asserted that foreign assistance was undoubtedly attainable this was not founded on any private information but was an opinion derived from their knowledge of the principles of policy by which states usually regulate their conduct towards each other in their address to the speaker and gentlemen of the assembly of jamaica they dilated on the arbitrary systems of the british ministry and informed them that in order to obtain a redress of their grievances they had appealed to the justice humanity and interest of greatbritain they stated that to make their schemes of nonimportation and nonexportation produce the desired effects they were obliged to extend them to the islands from that necessity and from that alone said they our conduct has proceeded they concluded with saying the peculiar situation of your island forbids your assistance but we have your good wishes—from the good wishes of the friends of liberty and mankind we shall always derive consolation in their address to the people of ireland they recapitulated their grievances stated their humble petitions and the neglect with which they had been treated in defence of our persons and properties under actual violations said they we have taken up arms when that violence shall be removed and hostilities cease on the part of the aggressors they shall cease on our part also these several addresses were executed in a masterly manner and were well calculated to make friends to the colonies but their petition     to the king which was drawn up at the same time produced more solid advantages in favour of the american cause than any other of their productions this was in a great measure carried through congress by mr dickinson       several members judging from the violence with which parliament proceeded against the colonies were of opinion that farther petitions were nugatory but this worthy citizen a friend to both countries and devoted to a reconciliation on     constitutional principles urged the expediency and policy of trying once more the effect of an humble decent and firm petition to the common head of the empire the high opinion that was conceived of his patriotism and abilities induced the members to assent to the measure though they generally conceived it to be labour lost the petition agreed upon was the work of mr dickinsons pen in this among other things it was stated july   that notwithstanding their sufferings they had retained too high a regard for the kingdom from which they derived their origin to request such a reconciliation as might in any manner be inconsistent with her dignity and welfare attached to his majestys person family and government with all the devotion that principle and affection can inspire connected with greatbritain by the strongest ties that can unite society and deploring every event that tended in any degree to weaken them they not only most fervently desired the former harmony between her and the colonies to be restored but that a concord might be established between them upon so firm a basis as to perpetuate its blessings uninterrupted by any future dissentions to succeeding generations in both countries they therefore beseeched that his majesty would be pleased to direct some mode by which the united applications of his faithful colonists to the throne in pursuance of their common councils might be improved into a happy and permanent reconciliation by this last clause congress meant that the mother country should propose a plan for establishing by compact something like magna charta for the colonies they did not aim at a total exemption from the controul of parliament nor were they unwilling to contribute in their own way to the expences of government but they feared the horrors of war less than submission to unlimited parliamentary supremacy they wished for an amicable compact in which doubtful undefined points should be ascertained so as to secure that proportion     of authority and liberty which would be for the general good of the whole empire they fancied themselves in the condition of the barons at runnymede but with this difference that in     addition to opposing the king they had also to oppose the parliament       this difference was more nominal than real for in the latter case the king and parliament stood precisely in the same relation to the people of america which subsisted in the former between the king and people of england in both popular leaders were contending with the sovereign for the privileges of subjects this well meant petition was presented on september  st      by mr penn and mr lee and on the  th lord dartmouth informed them that to it no answer would be given this slight contributed not a little to the union and perseverance of the colonists when pressed by the calamities of war a doubt would sometimes arise in the minds of scrupulous persons that they had been too hasty in their opposition to their protecting parent state to such it was usual to present the second petition of congress to the king observing thereon that all the blood and all the guilt of the war must be charged on british and not on american counsels oct     though the colonists were accused in a speech from the throne as meaning only to amuse by vague expressions of attachment to the parent state and the strongest protestations of loyalty to their king while they were preparing for a general revolt and that their rebellious war was manifestly carried on for the purpose of establishing an independent empire yet at that time and for months after a redress of grievances was their ultimate aim conscious of this intention and assenting in the sincerity of their souls to the submissive language of their petition they illy brooked the contempt with which their joint supplication was treated and still worse that they should be charged from the throne with studied duplicity nothing contributes more to the success of revolutions than moderation intemperate zealots overshoot themselves and soon spend their force while the calm and dispassionate persevere to the end the bulk of the people in civil commotions are influenced to a choice of sides by the general complexion of the measures adopted by the respective parties when these appear to be dictated by justice and prudence and to be     uninfluenced by passion ambition or avarice they are disposed to favour them such was the effect of this second petition through a long and trying war in which  00 men of serious reflection were often called upon to examine the rectitude of their conduct though the refusal of an answer to this renewed application of congress to the king was censured by numbers in greatbritain as well as in the colonies yet the partisans of ministry varnished the measure as proper and expedient they contended that the petition as it contained no offers of submission was unavailing as a ground work of negociation nothing was farther from the thoughts of congress than such concessions as were expected in greatbritain they conceived themselves to be more sinned against than sinning they claimed a redress of grievances as a matter of right but were persuaded that concessions for this purpose were acts of justice and not of humiliation and therefore could not be disgraceful to those by whom they were made to prevent future altercations they wished for an amicable compact to ascertain the extent of parliamentary supremacy the mother country wished for absolute submission to her authority the colonists for a repeal of every act that imposed taxes or that interfered in their internal legislation the ministry of england being determined not to repeal these acts and the congress equally determined not to submit to them the claims of the two countries were so wide of each other as to afford no reasonable ground to expect a compromise it was therefore concluded that any notice taken of the petition would only afford an opportunity for the colonies to prepare themselves for the last extremity a military opposition to the armies of greatbritain being resolved upon by the colonies it became an object of consequence to fix on a proper person to conduct that opposition       many of the colonists had titles of high rank in the militia and several had seen something of real service in the late war between france and england but there was no individual of such superior military experience as to entitle him to a decided preeminence or even     to qualify him on that ground to contend on equal terms with the british masters of the art of war in elevating one man by the free voice of an invaded country to the command of thousands of his equal fellow citizens no consideration was regarded but the interest of the community to bind the uninvaded provinces more closely to the common cause policy directed the views of congress to the south  0  among the southern colonies virginia for numbers wealth and influence stood preeminent to attach so respectable a colony to the aid of massachusetts by selecting a commander in chief from that quarter was not less warranted by the great military genius of one of her distinguished citizens than dictated by sound policy june     george washington was by an unanimous vote appointed commander in chief of all the forces raised or to be raised for the defence of the colonies it was a fortunate circumstance attending his election that it was accompanied with no competition and followed by no envy that same general impulse on the public mind which led the colonists to agree in many other particulars pointed to as the most proper person for presiding over the military arrangements of america not only congress but the inhabitants in the east and the west in the north and the south as well before as at the time of embodying a continental army were in a great degree unanimous in his favour an attempt to draw the character of this truly great man would look like flattery posterity will doubtless do it justice his actions especially now while fresh in remembrance are his amplest panegyric suffice it in his life time only to particularise those qualities which being more common may be mentioned without offending the delicate sensibility of the most modest of men general washington was born on the   th of february      his education was such as favoured the production of a solid mind and a vigorous body mountain air abundant exercise in the open country—the wholesome toils of the chace and the delightful scenes of rural life expanded his limbs to an unusual but graceful     and well proportioned size       his youth was spent in the acquisition of useful knowledge and in pursuits tending to the improvement of his fortune or the benefit of his country fitted more for active than for speculative life he devoted the greater proportion of his time to the latter but this was amply compensated by his being frequently in such situations as called forth the powers of his mind and strengthened them by repeated exercise early in life in obedience to his countrys call he entered the military line and began his career of fame in opposing that power in concert with whose troops he acquired his last and most distinguished honours he was with  0  general braddock in      when that unfortunate officer from an excess of bravery chose rather to sacrifice his army than retreat from an unseen foe the remains of that unfortunate corpse were brought off the field of battle chiefly by the address and good conduct of colonel washington after the peace of paris      he retired to his estate and with great industry and success pursued the arts of peaceful life when the proceedings of the british parliament alarmed the colonists with apprehensions that a blow was levelled at their liberties he again came forward into public view and was appointed a delegate to the congress which met in september      possessed of a large proportion of common sense directed by a sound judgment he was better fitted for the exalted station to which he was called than many others who to a greater brilliancy of parts frequently add the eccentricity of original genius engaged in the busy scenes of life he knew human nature and the most proper method of accomplishing proposed objects his passions were subdued and kept in subjection to reason his soul superior to party spirit to prejudice and illiberal views moved according to the impulses it received from an honest heart a good understanding common sense and a sound judgment he was habituated to view things on every side to consider them in all relations and to trace the possible and probable consequences of proposed measures much addicted to close thinking his mind was constantly employed       by frequent exercise     his understanding and judgment expanded so as to be able to discern truth and to know what was proper to be done in the most difficult conjunctures soon after general washington was appointed commander in chief of the american army four major generals one adjutant general with the rank of a brigadier and eight brigadiers general were appointed in subordination to him which were as follows lst major general artemas ward  d charles lee  d philip schuyler  th israel putnam adjutant general horatio gates  0  the   brigadiers were  st seth pomeroy  d richard montgomery  d david wooster  th william heath  th joseph spencer  th john thomas  th john sullivan  th nathaniel greene general washington replied to the president of congress announcing his appointment in the following words mr president though i am truly sensible of the high honour done me in this appointment yet i feel great distress from a consciousness that my abilities and military experience may not be equal to the extensive and important trust however as the congress desire it i will enter upon the momentous duty and exert every power i possess in their service and for support of the glorious cause i beg they will accept my most cordial thanks for this distinguished testimony of their approbation but lest some unlucky event should happen unfavourable to my reputation i beg it may be remembered by every gentleman in the room that i this day declare with the utmost sincerity i do not think myself equal to the command i am honoured with           as to pay sir i beg leave to assure the congress that as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment at the expence of my domestic ease and happiness i do not wish to make any profit from it i will keep an exact account of my expences those i doubt not they will discharge and that is all i desire a special commission was drawn up and presented to him and at the same time an unanimous resolution was adopted by congress that they would maintain and assist him and adhere to him with their lives and fortunes in the cause of american liberty instructions were also given him for his government by which after reciting various particulars he was directed to destroy or make prisoners of all persons who now are or who hereafter shall appear in arms  0  against the good people of the colonies but the whole was summed up in authorizing him to order and dispose of the army under his command as might be most advantageous for obtaining the end for which it had been raised making it his special care in discharge of the great trust committed to him that the liberties of america received no detriment june   –    about the same time twelve companies of riflemen were ordered to be raised in pennsylvania maryland and virginia the men to the amount of    0 were procured and forwarded with great expedition they had to march from   to  00 miles and yet the whole business was compleated and they joined the american army at cambridge in less than two months from the day on which the first resolution for raising them was agreed to june    coeval with the resolution for raising an army was another for emitting a sum not exceeding two millions of spanish milled dollars in bills of credit for the defence of america and the colonies were pledged for the redemption of them this sum was increased from time to time by farther emissions the colonies having neither money nor revenues at their command were forced to adopt this expedient the only one which was in their power for supporting an army       no one delegate   0 opposed the measure so great had been the credit of the former emissions of paper in the greater part of the colonies that very few at that time foresaw or apprehended the consequences of unfunded paper emissions but had all the consequences which resulted from this measure in the course of the war been forseen it must notwithstanding have been adopted for it was a less evil that there should be a general wreck of property than that the essential rights and liberties of a growing country should be lost a happy ignorance of future events combined with the ardor of the times prevented many reflections on this subject and gave credit and circulation to these bills of credit general washington soon after his appointment to the command of the american army set out for the camp at cambridge on his way thither he received an address from the provincial congress of newyork in which they expressed their joy at his appointment they also said we have the fullest assurances that whenever this important contest shall be decided by that fondest wish of each american soul an accommodation with our mother country you  0  will chearfully resign the important deposit committed into your hands and reassume the character of our worthiest citizen the general after declaring his gratitude for the regard shewn him added be assured that every exertion of my worthy colleagues and myself will be extended to the reestablishment of peace and harmony between the mother country and these colonies as to the fatal but necessary operations of war when we assumed the soldier we did not lay aside the citizen and we shall most sincerely rejoice with you in that happy hour when the reestablishment of american liberty on the most firm and solid foundations shall enable us to return to our private stations in the bosom of a free peaceful and happy country the general on his way to camp was treated with the highest honours in every place through which he passed large detachments of volunteers composed of private gentlemen turned out to escort him       a committee from the massachusetts congress received him about  00 miles     from boston and conducted him to the army he was soon after addressed by the congress of that colony in the most affectionate manner in his answer he said gentlemen your kind congratulations on my appointment and arrival demand my warmest ackowledgements and will ever be retained in grateful remembrance in exchanging the enjoyments of domestic life for the duties of my present honourable but arduous station i only emulate the virtue and public spirit of the whole province of massachusetts which with a firmness and patriotism without example has sacrificed all the comforts of social and political life in support of the rights of mankind and the welfare of our common country my highest ambition is to be the happy instrument of vindicating these rights and to see this devoted province again restored to peace liberty and safety july   when general washington arrived at cambridge he was received with the joyful acclamations of the american army at the head of his troops he published a declaration previously drawn up by congress in the nature of a manifesto setting forth the reasons for taking up arms in this after enumerating various grievances of the  0  colonies and vindicating them from a premeditated design of establishing independent states it was added in our own native land in defence of the freedom which is our birthright and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it—for the protection of our property acquired solely by the industry of our forefathers and ourselves against violence actually offered we have taken up arms we shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed and not before when general washington joined the american army he found the british intrenched on bunkershill having also three floating batteries in mystic river and a twenty gun ship below the ferry between boston and charlestown they had also a battery on copses hill and were strongly fortified on the neck       the americans were intrenched at winterhill prospecthill and roxbury communicating with one another by small posts     over a distance of ten miles there were also parties stationed in several towns along the sea coast they had neither engineers to plan suitable works nor sufficient tools for their erection in the american camp was collected a large body of men but without those conveniencies which ancient establishments have introduced for the comfort of regular armies instead of tents sails now rendered useless by the obstructions of commerce were applied for their covering but even of them there was not a sufficiency the american soldiers having joined the camp in all that variety of clothing which they used in their daily labour were without uniformity of dress to abolish provincial distinctions the hunting shirt was introduced they were also without those heads of departments in the line of commissaries or quarter masters which are necessary for the regular and economical supply of armies the troops from connecticut had proper officers appointed to procure them supplies but they who came from the other colonies were not so well furnished individuals brought to camp their own provisions on their own horses in some parts committees of supplies were appointed who purchased necessaries at public expence sent them on to camp and distributed them to such as were in want without any regularity or  0  system the country afforded provisions and nothing more was wanting to supply the army than proper systems for their collection and distribution other articles though equally necessary were almost wholly deficient and could not be procured but with difficulty on the  th of august the whole stock of powder in the american camp and in the public magazines of the four newengland provinces would make but little more than nine rounds a man the continental army remained in this destitute condition for a fortnight or more this was generally known among themselves and was also communicated to the british by a deserter but they suspecting a plot would not believe it a supply of a few tons was sent on to them from the committee of elizabethtown but this was done privately lest the adjacent inhabitants who were equally destitute     should stop it for their own use       the public rulers in massachusetts issued a recommendation to the inhabitants not to fire a gun at beast bird or mark in order that they might husband their little stock for the more necessary purpose of shooting men a supply of several thousand pounds weight of powder was soon after obtained from africa in exchange for newengland rum this was managed with so much address that every ounce for sale in the british forts on the african coasts was purchased up and brought off for the use of the americans embarrassments from various quarters occurred in the formation of a continental army the appointment of general officers made by congress was not satisfactory enterprising leaders had come forward with their followers on the commencement of hostilities without scrupulous attention to rank when these were all blended together it was impossible to assign to every officer the station which his services merited or his vanity demanded materials for a good army were collected the husbandmen who flew to arms were active zealous and of unquestionable courage but to introduce discipline and subordination among free men who were habituated to think for themselves was an arduous labour the want of system and of union under proper heads pervaded every department from the circumstance that the persons employed in providing necessaries for the army were unconnected with each other much waste and unnecessary delays were occasioned the troops of the different colonies came into service under variant  0  establishments—some were enlisted with the express condition of choosing their officers the rations promised by the local legislatures varied both as to quantity quality and price to form one uniform mass of these discordant materials and to subject the licentiousness of independent freemen to the controul of military discipline was a delicate and difficult business the continental army put under the command of general washington amounted to about    00 men       these had been so judiciously stationed round boston as     to confine the british to the town and to exclude them from the forage and provisions which the adjacent country and islands in bostonbay afforded this force was thrown into three grand divisions general ward commanded the right wing at roxbury general lee the left at prospecthill and the centre was commanded by general washington in arranging the army the military skill of adjutantgeneral gates was of great service method and punctuality were introduced the officers and privates were taught to know their respective places and to have the mechanism and movements as well as the name of an army when some effectual pains had been taken to discipline the army it was found that the term for which enlistments had taken place was on the point of expiring the troops from connecticut and rhodeisland were only engaged till the  st day of december      and no part of the army longer than the first day of january      such mistaken apprehensions respecting the future conduct of greatbritain prevailed that many thought the assumption of a determined spirit of resistance would lead to a redress of all their grievances oct  0 towards the close of the year general gage sailed for england and the command devolved on general howe nov the massachusetts assembly and continental congress both resolved to fit out armed vessels to cruise on the american coast for the purpose of interrupting warlike stores and supplies designed for the use of the british army the object was at first limited but as the prospect of accommodation vanished it was extended to all british property afloat on the high seas the americans were diffident of their ability to do any thing on water in opposition to the greatest naval power in the world but from a combination of circumstances their first attempts were successful nov    the lee privateer captain manly took the brig nancy an ordnance  0  ship from woolwich containing a large brass mortar several pieces of brass cannon a large quantity of arms and ammunition with all manner of tools           utensils and machines necessary for camps and artillery had congress sent an order for supplies they could not have made out a list of articles more suitable to their situation than what was thus providentially thrown into their hands dec   in about   days after three ships with various stores for the british army and a brig from antigua with rum were taken by capt manly before five days more had elapsed several other store ships were captured by these means the distresses of the british troops in boston were increased and supplies for the continental army were procured naval captures being unexpected were matter of triumph to the americans and of surprize to the british the latter scarcely believed that the former would oppose them by land with a regular army but never suspected that a people so unfurnished as they were with many things necessary for arming vessels would presume to attempt any thing on water a spirit of enterprize invigorated by patriotic zeal prompted the hardy new englandmen to undertake the hazardous business and their success encouraged them to proceed dec     before the close of the year congress determined to build   vessels of    guns   of    and   of    while the americans were fitting out armed vessels and before they had made any captures an event took place which would have disposed a less determined people to desist from provoking the vengeance of the british navy this was the burning of falmouth in the northern parts of massachusetts oct     captain mowat in the canceaux of sixteen guns destroyed     houses and     stores and other buildings in that town this spread an alarm on the coast but produced no disposition to submit many moved from the sea ports with their families and effects but no solicitations were preferred for the obtaining of british protection in a few days after the burning of falmouth the old south meeting house in boston was taken into possession by the british and destined for a riding school and the service of the light dragoons these proceedings produced in the minds of the colonists a more determined spirit of resistance and a more general aversion to greatbritain   0 history of the american revolution  chapter viii fpage  0 lpage    chapter viii ticonderoga taken and canada invaded          it early occurred to many that if the sword decided the controversy between greatbritain and her colonies the possession of ticonderoga would be essential to the security of the latter situated on a promontory formed at the junction of the waters of lake george and lake champlain it is the key of all communication between newyork and canada messrs deane wooster parsons stevens and others of connecticut planned a scheme for obtaining possession of this valuable post having procured a loan of   00 dollars of public money and provided a sufficient quantity of powder and ball they set off for bennington to obtain the cooperation of colonel allen of that place two hundred and seventy men mostly of that brave and hardy people who are called green mountain boys were speedily collected at castleton which was fixed on as the place     of rendezvous at this place colonel arnold who though attended only with a servant was prosecuting the same object unexpectedly joined them he had been early chosen a captain of a volunteer company by the inhabitants of newhaven among whom he resided as soon as he recieved news of the lexington battle he marched off with his company for the vicinity of boston and arrived there though   0 miles distant in a few days immediately after his arrival he waited on the massachusetts committee of safety and informed them that there were at ticonderoga many pieces of cannon and a great quantity of valuable stores and that the fort was in a ruinous condition and garrisoned only by about  0 men they appointed him a colonel and commissioned him to raise  00 men and to take ticonderoga the leaders of the party which had previously rendezvoused at castleton admitted colonel arnold to join them and it was agreed that colonel allen should be the commander in chief of the expedition and that colonel arnold should be his assistant they proceeded without delay and arrived in the night at lake champlain opposite to ticonderoga     allen and arnold crossed over with    men and landed near the garrison they contended who should go in first but it was at last agreed that they should both go in together may    they advanced abreast and entered the fort at the dawning of day may  0  a sentry snapped his piece at one of them and then retreated through the covered way to the parade the americans followed and immediately drew up the commander surprised in his bed was called upon to surrender the fort he asked by what authority colonel allen replied i demand it in the name of the great jehovah and the continental congress no resistance was made and the fort with its valuable stores and fortyeight prisoners fell into the hands of the americans the boats had been sent back for the remainder of the men but the business was done before they got over colonel seth warner was sent off with a party to take possession of crownpoint where a serjeant and    men performed garrison duty this was speedily effected the next object calling for the attention of the americans was to obtain the command of lake champlain but to accomplish this it was necessary for them to get possession of a sloop of war lying at st johns at the northern extremity of the lake with the view of capturing this sloop it was agreed to man and     arm a schooner lying at south bay and that arnold should command her and that allen should command some batteaux on the same expedition a favourable wind carried the schooner ahead of the batteaux and colonel arnold got immediate possession of the sloop by surprise the wind again favouring him he returned with his prize to ticonderoga and rejoined colonel allen the latter soon went home and the former with a number of men agreed to remain there in garrison in this rapid manner the possession of ticonderoga and the command of lake champlain was obtained without any loss by a few determined men intelligence of these events was in a few days communicated to congress which met for the first time at  0 oclock of the same day in the morning of which ticonderoga was taken       they rejoiced in the spirit of enterprise displayed by their     countrymen but feared the charge of being aggressors or of doing any thing to widen the breach between greatbritain and the colonies for an accommodation was at that time nearly their unanimous wish they therefore recommended to the committees of the cities and counties of newyork and albany to cause the cannon and stores to be removed from ticonderoga to the south end of lake george and to take an exact inventory of them in order that they might be safely returned when the restoration of the former harmony between greatbritain and the colonies so ardently wished for by the latter should render it prudent and consistent with the overruling law of selfpreservation  june    colonel arnold having begun his military career with a series of successes was urged by his native impetuosity to project more extensive operations he wrote a letter to congress strongly urging an expedition into canada and offering with  000 men to reduce the whole province in his ardent zeal to oppose greatbritain he had advised the adoption of offensive war even before congress had organised an army or appointed a single military officer his importunity was at last successful as shall hereafter be related but not till two months had elapsed subsequent to his first proposition of conducting an expedition against canada such was the increasing fervor of the public mind in      that what in the early part of the year was deemed violent and dangerous was in its progress pronounced both moderate and expedient     sir guy carleton the kings governor in canada no sooner heard that the americans had surprised ticonderoga and crownpoint and obtained the command of lake champlain than he planned a scheme for their recovery having only a few regular troops under his command he endeavored to induce the canadians and indians to cooperate with him but they both declined he established martial law that he might compel the inhabitants to take arms they declared themselves ready to defend the province but refused to march out of it or to commence hostilities on their neighbors       colonel johnston had on the same occasion repeated conferences with the     indians and endeavored to influence them to take up the hatchet but they steadily refused in order to gain their cooperation he invited them to feast on a bostonian and to drink his blood this in the indian style meant no more than to partake of a roasted ox and a pipe of wine at a public entertainment which was given on design to influence them to cooperate with the british troops the colonial patriots affected to understand it in its literal sense it furnished in their mode of explication a convenient handle for operating on the passions of the people these exertions in canada which were principally made with a view to recover ticonderoga crownpoint and the command of lake champlain induced congress to believe that a formidable invasion of their northwestern frontier was intended from that quarter the evident tendency of the quebec act favoured this opinion believing it to be the fixed purpose of the british ministry to attack the united colonies on that side they conceived that they would be inexcusable if they neglected the proper means for warding off so terrible a blow they were also sensible that the only practicable plan to effect this purpose was to make a vigorous attack upon canada while it was unable to resist the unexpected impression their success at ticonderoga and crownpoint had already paved the way for this bold enterprize and had broken down the fences which guarded the entrance into that province on the other hand they were sensible that by taking this step they changed at once the whole nature of the war from defensive it became offensive and subjected them to the imputation of being the aggressors they were well aware that several who had espoused their cause in britain would probably be     offended at this measure and charge them with heightening the mischiefs occasioned by the dispute they knew that the principles of resistance as far as they had hitherto acted upon them were abetted by a considerable party even in greatbritain and that to forfeit their good opinion might be of great disservice considerations of this kind made them weigh well the important step before   0 they ventured upon it       they on the other hand reflected that the eloquence of the minority in parliament and the petitions and remonstrances of the merchants in greatbritain had produced no solid advantages in their favour and that they had no chance of relief but from the smiles of heaven on their own endeavors the danger was pressing war was not only inevitable but already begun to wait till they were attacked by a formidable force at their backs in the very instant when their utmost exertions would be requisite perhaps insufficient to protect their cities and sea coast against an invasion from britain would be the summit of folly the laws of war and of nations justified the forestalling of an enemy the colonists argued that to prevent known hostile intentions was a matter of self defence they were also sensible they had already gone such lengths as could only be vindicated by arms and that if a certain degree of success did not attend their resistance they would be at the mercy of an irritated government and their moderation in the single instance of canada would be an unavailing plea for indulgence they were also encouraged to proceed by certain information that the french inhabitants of canada except the noblesse and the clergy were as much discontented with their present system of government as even the british settlers it seemed therefore probable that they would consider the provincials rather as friends than as enemies the invasion of that province was therefore determined upon if found practicable and not disagreeable to the canadians congress had committed the management of their military arrangements in this northern department to general schuyler and general montgomery while the former remained at albany to attend an indian treaty the latter was sent forward to ticonderoga with a body of troops from newyork and newengland soon after reaching ticonderoga he made a movement down lake champlain general schuyler overtook him at cape le motte from thence they moved     on to isle aux noix       about this time general schuyler addressed the inhabitants informing them that the only views of     congress were to restore to them those rights which every subject of the british empire of whatever religious sentiments he may be is entitled to and that in the execution of these truths he had received the most positive orders to cherish every canadian and every friend to the cause of liberty and sacredly to guard their property sep  0  the americans about  000 in number effected a landing at st johns which being the first british post in canada lies only     miles to the northward of ticonderoga the british piquets were driven into the fort the environs were then reconnoitered and the fortifications were found to be much stronger than had been suspected this induced the calling of a council of war which recommended a retreat to isle aux noix twelve miles south of st johns to throw a boom across the channel and to erect works for its defence soon after this event an extreme bad state of health induced general schuyler to retire to ticonderoga and the command devolved on general montgomery this enterprising officer in a few days returned to the vicinity of st johns and opened a battery against it ammunition was so scarce that the siege could not be carried on with any prospect of speedy success the general detached a small body of troops to attempt the reduction of fort chamblee only six miles distant success attended this enterprize by its surrender six tons of gun powder were obtained which enabled the general to prosecute the siege of st johns with vigor the garrison though straitened for provisions persevered in defending themselves with unabating fortitude while general montgomery was prosecuting this siege the governor of the province collected at montreal about  00 men chiefly militia and indians he endeavored to cross the river st lawrence with this force and to land at lonqueil intending to proceed thence to attack the besiegers but colonel warner with  00 green mountain boys and a four pounder prevented the execution of the design the governors party was suffered to come near the shore but was then fired upon with such effect as to make them retire after sustaining great loss     an account of this affair being communicated to the garrison     in st johns major preston the commanding officer surrendered on receiving honorable terms of capitulation by these it was agreed that the garrison should march out with the honors of war that the officers and privates should ground their arms on the plain—the oficers keep their side arms and their fire arms be reserved for them and that the people of the garrison should retain their effects about  00 regulars and  00 canadians became prisoners to the provincials they also acquired    pieces of cannon seven mortars and two howitzers and about  00 stand of arms among the cannon were many brass field pieces an article of which the americans were nearly destitute while the siege of st johns was pending colonel allen who was returning with about  0 men from a tour on which he had been sent by his general was captured by the british near montreal loaded with irons and in that condition sent to england major brown proposed that colonel allen should return to lonqueil procure canoes and cross the river st lawrence a little to the north of montreal while he with a force of about  00 men crossed a little to the south of it the former crossed in the night but the latter by some means failed on his part colonel allen found himself the next morning unsupported and exposed to immediate danger but nevertheless concluded on maintaining his ground general carleton knowing his weakness marched out against him with a superior force the colonel defended himself with his wonted bravery but being deserted by several of his party and having lost fifteen of his men he was compelled to surrender with the remainder amounting to    after the reduction of st johns general montgomery proceeded towards montreal the few british forces there unable to stand their ground repaired for safety on board the shipping in hopes of escaping down the river but they were prevented by colonel easton who was stationed at the point of sorel river with a number of continental troops some cannon and an armed gondola           general prescot who was on board with several officers and about   0 privates having no chance of escape submitted to be prisoners on terms of capitulation eleven sail of vessels with all their contents consisting of ammunition provision and entrenching tools became the property     of the provincials governor carleton was about this time conveyed in a boat with muffled paddles by a secret way to the three rivers and from thence to quebec in a few days when montreal was evacuated by the troops the inhabitants applied to general montgomery for capitulation he informed them that as they were defenseless they could not expect such a concession but he engaged upon his honour to maintain the individuals and religious communities of the city in the peaceable enjoyment of their property and the free exercise of their religion in all his transactions he spoke wrote and acted with dignity and propriety and in particular treated the inhabitants with liberality and politeness montreal which at this time surrendered to the provincials carried on an extensive trade and contained many of those articles which from the operation of the resolutions of congress could not be imported into any of the united colonies from these stores the american soldiers who had hitherto suffered from the want of suitable clothing obtained a plentiful supply general montgomery after leaving some troops in montreal and sending detachments into different parts of the province to encourage the canadians and to forward provisions advanced towards the capital his little army arrived with expedition before quebec success had hitherto crowned every attempt of general montgomery but notwithstanding his situation was very embarrassing much to be pitied is the officer who having been bred to arms in the strict discipline of regular armies is afterwards called to command men who carry with them the spirit of freedom into the field       the greater part of the americans officers as well as soldiers having never seen any service were ignorant of their duty and but feebly impressed with the military ideas of union subordination     and discipline the army was continental in name and pay but in no other respect not only the troops of different colonies conceived themselves independent of each other but in some instances the different regiments of the same colony were backward to submit to the orders of officers in a higher grade of another line they were also soon tired of a military life novelty and the first impulse of passion had led them to camp but the approaching cold season together with the fatigues and dangers incident to war induced a general wish to     relinquish the service though by the terms of their enlistment they were to be discharged in a few weeks they could not brook an absence from their homes for that short space of time the ideas of liberty and independence which roused the colonists to oppose the claims of greatbritain operated against that implicit obedience which is necessary to a well regulated army even in european states where long habits have established submission to superiors as a primary duty of the common people the difficulty of governing recruits when first led to the field from civil occupations is great but to exercise discipline over freemen accustomed to act only from the impulse of their own minds required not only a knowledge of human nature but an accommodating spirit and a degree of patience which is rarely found among officers of regular armies the troops under the immediate command of general montgomery were from their usual habits averse to the ideas of subordination and had suddenly passed from domestic ease to the numberless wants and distresses which are incident to marches through strange and desert countries every difficulty was increased by the short term for which they were enlisted to secure the affections of the canadians it was necessary for the american general to restrain the appetites and control the licentiousness of his soldiery while the appearance of military harshness was dangerous lest their good will might be forfeited in this choice of difficulties the genius of montgomery surmounted many obstacles       during his short but glorious      career he conducted with so much prudence as to make it doubtful whether we ought to admire most the goodness of the man or the address of the general about the same time that canada was invaded in the usual route from newyork a considerable detachment from the american army at cambridge was conducted into that royal province by a new and unexpected passage sep     colonel arnold who successfully conducted this bold undertaking thereby acquired the name of the american hannibal he was detached with a thousand men from cambridge to penetrate into canada by ascending the river kennebeck and descending by the chaundiere to the river st lawrence great were the difficulties these troops had to encounter in marching by an unexplored route  00 miles through an uninhabited country in     ascending the kennebeck they were constantly obliged to work upwards against an impetuous current they were often compelled by cataracts or other impediments to land and to haul their batteaux up rapid streams and over falls of rivers nor was their march by land more eligible than this passage by water they had deep swamps thick woods difficult mountains and craggy precipices alternatively to encounter at some places they had to cut their way for miles together through forests so embarrassed that their progress was only four or five miles a day the constant fatigue caused many men to fall sick one third of the number which set out were from want of necessaries obliged to return the others proceeded with unabated fortitude and constancy provisions grew at length so scarce that some of the men ate their dogs cartouch boxes breeches and shoes when they were an hundred miles from any habitation or prospect of a supply their whole store was divided which yielded four pints of flour for each man after they had baked and eaten their last morsel they had thirty miles to travel before they could expect any farther supply the men bore up under these complicated distresses with the greatest fortitude they gloried in the hope of completing a march which would rival the fame of similar expeditions undertaken by the heroes of antiquity           having spent thirty one days in traversing a hideous wilderness without ever seeing anything human they at length reached the inhabited parts of canada they were there well received and supplied with every thing necessary for their comfort the canadians were struck with amazement when they saw this armed force emerging from the wilderness it had never entered their conceptions that it was possible for human beings to traverse such immense wilds the most pointed instructions had been given to this corps to conciliate the affections of the canadians it was particularly enjoined upon them if the son of lord chatham then an officer in one of the british regiments in that province should fall into their hands to treat him with all possible attention in return for the great exertions of his father in behalf of american liberty a manifesto subscribed by general washington which had been sent from cambridge with this detachment was circulated among the inhabitants of canada in this they were invited to arrange themselves under the standard of general liberty and they were informed that   0 the american army was sent into the province not to plunder but to protect them nov   while general montgomery lay at montreal colonel arnold arrived at point levy opposite to quebec such was the consternation of the garrison and inhabitants at his unexpected appearance that had not the river intervened an immediate attack in the first surprize and confusion might have been successful the bold enterprise of one american army marching through the wilderness at a time when success was crowning every undertaking of another invading in a different direction struck terror into the breasts of those canadians who were unfriendly to the designs of congress the embarrassments of the garrison were increased by the absence of sir guy carleton that gallant officer on hearing of montgomerys invasion prepared to oppose him in the extremes of the province while he was collecting a force to attack invaders in one direction a different corps emerging out of the depths of an unexplored wilderness suddenly appeared from another       in a few days after colonel arnold     had arrived at point levy he crossed the river st lawrence but his chance of succeeding by a coup de main was in that short space greatly diminished the critical moment was past the panic occasioned by his first appearance had abated and solid preparations for the defence of the town were adopted the inhabitants both english and canadians as soon as danger pressed united for their common defence alarmed for their property they were at their own request embodied for its security the sailors were taken from the shipping in the harbour and put to the batteries on shore as colonel arnold had no artillery after parading some days on the heights near quebec he drew off his troops intending nothing more until the arrival of montgomery than to cut off supplies from entering the garrison so favourable were the prospects of the united colonies at this period that general montgomery set on foot a regiment of canadians to be in the pay of congress james livingston a native of new york who had long resided in canada was appointed to the command thereof and several recruits were engaged for the term of twelve months the inhabitants on both sides of the river st laurence were very friendly expresses in the employ of the americans went without molestation backwards and forwards between montreal and     quebec many individuals performed signal services in favour of the invading army among a considerable number mr price stands conspicuous who advanced  000£ in specie for their use various causes had contributed to attach the inhabitants of canada especially those of the inferior classes to the interest of congress and to alienate their affections from the government of greatbritain the contest was for liberty and there is something in that sound captivating to the mind of man in a state of original simplicity it was for the colonies and canada was also a colony the objects of the war were therefore supposed to be for their common advantage the form of government lately imposed on them by act of parliament was far from being so free as the constitutions of the other     colonies and was in many respects particularly oppressive       the common people had no representative share in enacting the laws by which they were to be governed and were subjected to the arbitrary will of persons over whom they had no constitutional control distinctions so degrading were not unobserved by the native canadians but were more obvious to those who had known the privileges enjoyed in the neighbouring provinces several individuals educated in newengland and newyork with the high ideas of liberty inspired by their free constitutions had in the interval between the peace of paris      and the commencement of the american war migrated into canada such sensibly felt the difference between the governments they had left and the arbitrary constitution imposed on them and both from principle and affection earnestly persuaded the canadians to make a common cause with the united colonies though motives of this kind induced the peasantry of the country to espouse the interest of congress yet sundry individuals and some whole orders of men threw the weight of their influence into the opposite scale the legal privileges which the roman catholic clergy enjoyed made them averse to a change lest they should be endangered by a more intimate connection with their protestant neighbours they used their influence in the next world as an engine to operate on the movements of the present they refused absolution to such of their flocks as abetted the americans this interdiction of the joys of heaven by those who were supposed to hold the keys of it operated powerfully on the opinions and practices of the superstitious     multitude the seigneurs had also immunities unknown in the other colonies such is the fondness for power in every human breast that revolutions are rarely favoured by any order of men who have reason to apprehend that their future situation will in case of a change be less preeminent than before the sagacious general montgomery no less a man of the world than an officer discovered great address in accommodating himself to these clashing interests       though he knew the part the popish clergy had acted in opposition     to him yet he conducted towards them as if totally ignorant of the matter and treated them and their religion with great respect and attention as far as he was authorised to promise he engaged that their ecclesiastical property should be secured and the free exercise of their religion continued to all he held forth the flattering idea of calling a convention of representatives freely chosen to institute by its own will such a form of government as they approved while the great mind of this illustrious man was meditating schemes of liberty and happiness a military force was collecting and training to oppose him which in a short time put a period to his valuable life at the time the americans were before montreal general carleton as has been related escaped through their hands and got safe to quebec his presence was itself a garrison the confidence reposed in his talents inspired the men under his command to make the most determined resistance soon after his arrival he issued a proclamation setting forth that all persons liable to do militia duty and residing in quebec who refused to arm in conjunction with the royal army should in four days quit quebec with their families and withdraw themselves from the limits of the district by the first of december on pain of being treated afterwards as spies or rebels all who were unwilling to cooperate with the british army being thus disposed of the remaining inhabitants though unused to arms became in a little time so far acquainted with them as to be very useful in defending the town they supported fatigues and submitted to command with a patience and chearfulness that could not be exceeded by men familiarized to the hardships and subordination of a military life dec   general montgomery having effected at point aux trembles a junction with colonel arnold commenced the siege of quebec upon     his arrival before the town he wrote a letter to the british governor recommending an immediate surrender to prevent the dreadful consequences of a storm       though the flag which conveyed this letter was fired upon and all communication refused   0 general montgomery found other means to convey a letter of the same tenor into the garrison but the inflexible firmness of the governor could not be moved either by threats or dangers the americans soon after commenced a bombardment with five small mortars but with very little effect in a few days general montgomery opened a six gun battery at the distance of seven hundred yards from the walls but his metal was too light to make any impression the news of general montgomerys success in canada had filled the colonies with expectations that the conquest of quebec would soon add fresh lustre to his already brilliant fame he knew well the consequences of popular disappointment and was besides of opinion that unless something decisive was immediately done the benefit of his previous acquisitions would in a great degree be lost to the american cause on both accounts he was strongly impelled to make every exertion for satisfying the expectations and promoting the interest of a people who had honoured him with so great a share of their confidence the government of greatbritain in the extensive province of canada was at that time reduced to the single town of quebec the astonished world saw peaceable colonists suddenly transformed into soldiers and these marching through unexplored wildernesses and extending themselves by conquests in the first moment after they had assumed the profession of arms towards the end of the year the tide of fortune began to turn dissentions broke out between colonel arnold and some of his officers threatening the annihilation of discipline the continental currency had no circulation in canada and all the hard money furnished for the expedition was nearly expended difficulties of every kind were daily increasing the extremities of fatigue were constantly to be encountered the american general had not a sufficient number of men to make the proper reliefs in the daily labours they underwent and that inconsiderable number worn down with toil was constantly exposed to the severities of a canada winter       the period for which a great part of his men had enlisted being on the point of expiration     he     apprehended that they who were entitled to it would insist on their discharge on the other hand he saw no prospect of staggering the resolution of the garrison they were well supplied with every thing necessary for their defence and were daily acquiring additional firmness the extremity of winter was fast approaching from these combined circumstances general montgomery was impressed with a conviction that the siege should either be raised or brought to a summary termination to storm the place was the only feasible method of effecting the latter purpose but this was an undertaking in which success was but barely possible great minds are seldom exact calculators of danger nor do they minutely attend to the difficulties which obstruct the attainment of their objects fortune in contempt of the pride of man has ever had an influence in the success or failure of military enterprises some of the greatest achievements of that kind have owed their success to a noble contempt of common forms the upper part of quebec was surrounded with very strong works and the access from the lower town was excessively difficult from its almost perpendicular steepness general montgomery from a native intrepidity and an ardent thirst for glory overlooked all these dangers and resolved at once either to carry the place or perish in the attempt trusting much to his good fortune—confiding in the bravery of his troops and their readiness to follow whithersoever he should lead and depending somewhat on the extensiveness of the works he determined to attempt the town by escalade the garrison of quebec at this time consisted of about    0 men of which  00 were militia and   0 were seamen belonging to the kings frigates or merchant ships in the harbour the rest were marines regulars or colonel macleans new raised emigrants the american army consisted of about  00 men some had been left at montreal and near a third of arnolds detachment as has been related had returned to cambridge general montgomery having divided this little force into four detachments ordered two feints to be made     against the upper town one by colonel livingston at the head of the canadians against st johns gate and the other by major brown against cape diamond reserving to himself and colonel arnold the two principal attacks     against the lower town dec     at five oclock in the morning general montgomery advanced against the lower town he passed the first barrier and was just opening to attack the second when he was killed together with his aid de camp captain john mpherson captain cheesman and some others this so dispirited the men that colonel campbell on whom the command devolved thought proper to draw them off in the mean time colonel arnold at the head of about   0 men passed through st roques and approached near a two gun battery without being discovered this he attacked and though it was well defended carried it but with considerable loss in this attack colonel arnold received a wound which made it necessary to carry him off the field of battle his party nevertheless continued the assault and pushing on made themselves masters of a second barrier these brave men sustained the force of the whole garrison for three hours but finding themselves hemmed in and without hopes either of success relief or retreat they yielded to numbers and the advantageous situation of their adversaries the loss of the americans in killed and wounded was about  00 and  00 were taken prisoners among the slain were captain kendricks lieutenant humphries and lieutenant cooper the behaviour of the provincial troops was such as might have silenced those who had reproached them for being deficient in courage the most experienced veterans could not have exceeded the firmness they displayed in their last attack the issue of this assault relieved the garrison of quebec from all apprehensions for its safety the provincials were so much weakened as to be scarcely equal to their own defence however colonel arnold had the boldness to encamp within three miles of the town and had the address even with his reduced numbers to impede the conveyance of refreshments and provisions into the garrison his situation was extremely difficult       he was     at an immense distance from those parts where effectual assistance could be expected on his first entrance into the province he had experienced much kind treatment from the inhabitants the canadians besides being fickle in their resolutions are apt to be biassed by success their disposition to aid the americans became therefore daily more precarious it was even difficult to keep the provincial troops from returning to their respective homes their sufferings     were great while their adversaries were comfortably housed in quebec they were exposed in the open air to the extreme rigour of the season the severity of a canada winter was far beyond any thing with which they were acquainted the snow lay above four feet deep on a level this deliverance of quebec may be considered as a proof how much may be done by one man for the preservation of a country it also proves that soldiers may in a short time be formed out of the mass of citizens the conflict being over the ill will which had subsisted during the siege between the royal and provincial troops gave way to sentiments of humanity the americans who surrendered were treated with kindness ample provisions were made for their wounded and no unnecessary severity shewn to any few men have ever fallen in battle so much regretted by both sides as general montgomery his many amiable qualities had procured him an uncommon share of private affection and his great abilities an equal proportion of public esteem being a sincere lover of liberty he had engaged in the american cause from principle and quitted the enjoyment of an easy fortune and the highest domestic felicity to take an active share in the fatigues and dangers of a war instituted for the defence of the community of which he was an adopted member his well known character was almost equally esteemed by the friends and foes of the side which he had espoused in america he was celebrated as a martyr to the liberties of mankind in greatbritain as a misguided good man sacrificing to what he supposed to be the rights of his country his name was mentioned in parliament with singular respect       some of the most     powerful speakers in that illustrious assembly displayed their eloquence in sounding his praise and lamenting his fate those in particular who had been his fellow soldiers in the late war expatiated on his many virtues the minister himself acknowledged his worth while he reprobated the cause for which he fell he concluded an involuntary panegyric by saying curse on his virtues they have undone his country though the invasion of canada was finally unsuccessful yet the advantages which the americans gained in the months of september     and october gave fresh spirits to their army and people the boldness of the enterprise might have taught greatbritain the folly of persisting in the design of subjugating america but instead of preserving the union and restoring the peace of the empire by repealing a few of her laws she from mistaken dignity resolved on a more vigorous prosecution of the war     history of the american revolution  chapter ix fpage    lpage  0 chapter ix transactions in virginia the carolinas georgia and the general state of public affairs in the colonies it has already been mentioned that the colonists from the rising of congress in october      and particularly after the lexington battle were attentive to the training their militia and making the necessary preparations for their defence the effects of their arrangements for this purpose varied with circumstances where there were no royal troops and where ordinary prudence was observed the public peace was undisturbed in other cases the intemperate zeal of governors and the imprudent warmth of the people anticipated the calamities of war before its proper time virginia though there was not a single british soldier within its limits was by the indiscretion of its governor lord dunmore involved for several months in difficulties but little short of those     to which the inhabitants of massachusetts were     subjected       his lordship was but illy fitted to be at the helm in this tempestuous season his passions predominated over his understanding and precipitated him into measures injurious both to the people whom he governed and to the interest of his royal master the virginians from the earliest stages of the controversy had been in the foremost line of opposition to the claims of greatbritain but at the same time treated lord dunmore with the attention that was due to his station in common with the other provinces they had taken effectual measures to prepare their militia for the purposes of defence apr  0 while they were pursuing this object his lordship engaged a party belonging to a royal vessel in james river to convey some public powder from a magazine in williamsburg on board their ship the value or quantity of the powder was inconsiderable but the circumstances attending its removal begat suspicions that lord dunmore meant to deprive the inhabitants of the means of defence they were therefore alarmed and assembled with arms to demand its restitution by the interposition of the mayor and corporation of williamsburg extremities were prevented reports were soon after spread that a second attempt to rob the magazine was intended the inhabitants again took arms and instituted nightly patroles with a determined resolution to protect it the governor was irritated at these commotions and in the warmth of his temper threatened to set up the royal standard–franchise the negroes and arm them against their masters this irritated but did not intimidate several public meetings were held in the different counties in all of which the removal of the powder from the magazine and the governors threats were severely condemned some of the gentlemen of hanover and the neighbouring counties assembled in arms under the conduct of mr patrick henry and marched towards williamsburg with an avowed design to obtain restitution of the powder and to take measures for securing the public treasury this ended in a negotiation by which it was agreed that payment for the powder by     the receiver general of the colony should be accepted in lieu of restitution and that upon the engagement of the inhabitants of williamsburg to guard both the treasury and the magazine the armed parties should return to their habitations   0 the alarm of this affair induced lord dunmore to send his lady and family on board the fowey man of war in james river about the same time his lordship with the assistance of a detachment of marines fortified his palace and surrounded it with artillery he soon after issued a proclamation in which mr henry and his associates were charged with rebellious practices and the present commotions were attributed to a desire in the people of changing the established form of government several meetings were held in the neighbouring counties in which the conduct of mr henry and of his associates was applauded and resolutions were adopted that at every risque he and they should be indemnified about this time copies of some letters from governor dunmore to the minister of the american department were made public these in the opinion of the virginians contained unfair and unjust representations of facts and also of their temper and disposition many severe things were said on both sides and fame as usual magnified or misrepresented whatever was said or done one distrust begat another every thing tended to produce a spirit of discontent and the fever of the public mind daily increased in this state of disorder the governor convened the general assembly the leading motive for this unexpected measure was to procure their approbation and acceptance of the terms of the conciliatory motion agreed to in parliament on the  0th of the preceding february his lordship introduced this to their consideration in a long and plausible speech in a few days they presented their address in answer in which among other grounds of rejection they stated that the proposed plan only changed the form of oppression without lessening its burthen but they referred the papers for a final determination to congress for themselves they declared           we have exhausted every mode of application which our invention could suggest as proper and promising we have decently remonstrated with parliament they have added new injuries to the old we have wearied our king with supplications he has not deigned to answer us we have appealed to the native honour and justice of the british nation their efforts in our favour have been hitherto ineffectual the assembly among their first acts appointed a committee to     enquire into the causes of the late disturbances and particularly to examine the state of the magazine they found most of the remaining powder buried the muskets deprived of their locks and spring guns planted in the magazine these discoveries irritated the people and occasioned intemperate expressions of resentment may    lord dunmore quitted the palace privately and retired on board the fowey man of war which then lay near yorktown he left a message for the house of burgesses acquainting them that he thought it prudent to retire to a place of safety having reason to believe that he was in constant danger of falling a sacrifice to popular fury he nevertheless hoped they would proceed in the great business before them and he engaged to render the communication between him and the house as easy and as safe as possible he assured them that he would attend as heretofore to the duties of his office and that he was well disposed to restore that harmony which had been unhappily interrupted this message produced a joint address from the council and house of burgesses in which they represented his lordships fears to be groundless and declared their willingness to concur in any measure he would propose for the security of himself and family and concluded by entreating his return to the palace lord dunmore in a reply justified his apprehensions of danger from the threats which had been repeatedly thrown out he charged the house of burgesses with countenancing the violent proceedings of the people and with a design to usurp the executive power and subvert the constitution this produced a reply fraught with recrimination and defensive     arguments every incident afforded fresh room for altercation       there was a continued intercourse by addresses messages and answers between the house of burgesses and the fowey but little of the public business was completed his lordship was still acknowledged as the lawful governor of the province but did not think proper to set his foot on shore in the country over which his functions were to be exercised at length when the necessary bills were ready for ratification the council and burgesses jointly intreated the governors presence to give his assent to them and finish the session after several messages     and answers lord dunmore peremptorily refused to meet the assembly at the capital their usual place of deliberation but said he would be ready to receive them on the next monday at his present residence on board the fowey for the purpose of giving his assent to such bills as he should approve of upon receiving this answer the house of burgesses passed resolutions in which they declared that the message requiring them to attend the governor on board a ship of war was a high breach of their rights and privileges—that they had reason to fear a dangerous attack was meditated against the colony and it was therefore their opinion that they should prepare for the preservation of their rights and liberties after strongly professing loyalty to the king and amity to the mother country they broke up their session july     the royal government in virginia from that day ceased soon after a convention of delegates was appointed to supply the place of the assembly as these had an unlimited confidence reposed in them they became at once possessed of undefined discretionary powers both legislative and executive they exercised this authority for the security of their constituents they raised and embodied an armed force and took other measures for putting the colony in a state of defence they published a justification of their conduct and set forth the necessity of the measures they had adopted       they concluded with professions of loyalty and declared that though they were determined at every hazard to maintain their rights and privileges     it was also their fixed resolution to disband such forces as were raised for the defence of the colony whenever their dangers were removed the headstrong passions of lord dunmore precipitated him into farther follies with the aid of the loyalists run away negroes and some frigates that were on the station he established a marine force by degrees he equipped and armed a number of vessels of different kinds and sizes in one of which he constantly resided except when he went on shore in a hostile manner this force was calculated only for depredation and never became equal to any essential service obnoxious persons were seized and taken on board negroes were carried off—plantations ravaged—and houses burnt these proceedings occasioned the sending of some detachments of the new raised provincial forces to protect the coasts this produced a predatory war from which neither honour nor benefit could be     acquired and in which every necessary from on shore was purchased at the risque of blood oct     the forces under his lordship attempted to burn hampton but the crews of the royal vessels employed in that business though they had begun to cannonade it were so annoyed by riflemen from on shore that they were obliged to quit their station nov    in a few days after this repulse a proclamation was issued by the governor dated on board the ship william off norfolk declaring that as the civil law was at present insufficient to punish treason and traitors martial law should take place and be executed throughout the colony and requiring all persons capable of bearing arms to repair to his majestys standard or to be considered as traitors he also declared all indented servants negroes and others appertaining to rebels who were able and willing to bear arms and who joined his majestys forces to be free among the circumstances which induced the rulers of greatbritain to count on an easy conquest of america the great number of slaves had a considerable weight on the sea coast of five of the most southern provinces the number of slaves exceeded that of freemen       it was supposed that the proffer of freedom would detach them   0 from their masters interest and bind them by strong ties to support the royal standard perhaps under favourable circumstances these expectations would in some degree have been realised but lord dunmores indiscretion deprived his royal master of this resource six months had elapsed since his lordship first threatened its adoption the negroes had in a great measure ceased to believe and the inhabitants to fear it excited less surprize and produced less effect than if it had been more immediate and unexpected the country was now in a tolerable state of defence and the force for protecting the negroes in case they had closed with his lordships offer was far short of what would have been necessary for their security the injury done the royal cause by the bare proposal of the scheme far outweighed any advantage that resulted from it the colonists were struck with horror and filled with detestation of a government which was exercised in loosening the bands of society and destroying domestic security the union and vigor which was given to their opposition was great while the additional force acquired by his lordship was inconsiderable it nevertheless produced     some effect in norfolk and the adjoining country where his lordship was joined by several hundreds both whites and blacks the governor having once more got footing on the main amused himself with hopes of acquiring the glory of reducing one part of the province by means of the other the provincials had now an object against which they might direct their arms an expedition was therefore concerted against the force which had taken post at norfolk to protect his adherents lord dunmore constructed a fort at the great bridge on the norfolk side and furnished it with artillery the provincials also fortified themselves near to the same place with a narrow causeway in their front in this state both parties continued quiet for some days dec    the royalists commenced an attack captain fordyce at the head of about  0 british grenadiers passed the causeway and boldly marched up to the provincial entrenchments with fixed bayonets       they were exposed without cover to the fire of the provincials     in front and enfiladed by another part of their works the brave captain and several of his men fell the lieutenant with others were taken and all who survived were wounded the slaves in this engagement were more prejudicial to their british employers than to the provincials captain fordyce was interred by the victors with military honors the english prisoners were treated with kindness but the americans who had joined the kings standard experienced the resentment of their countrymen the royal forces on the ensuing night evacuated their post at the great bridge and lord dunmore shortly after abandoned norfolk and retired with his people on board his ships many of the tories a name which was given to those who adhered to the royal interest sought the same asylum for themselves and moveable effects the provincials took possession of norfolk and the fleet with its new incumberances moved to a greater distance the people on board cut off from all peaceable intercourse with the shore were distressed for provisions and necessaries of every kind this occasioned sundry unimportant contests between the provincial forces and the armed ships and boats at length on the arrival of the liverpool man of war from england a flag was sent on shore to put the question whether they would supply his majestys ships with provisions an answer was returned in the negative it was then determined to     destroy the town jan         this was carried into effect and norfolk was reduced to ashes the whole loss was estimated at  00000£ sterling the provincials to deprive the ships of every resource of supply destroyed the houses and plantations that were near the water and obliged the people to move their cattle provisions and effects farther into the country lord dunmore with his fleet continued for several months on the coast and in the rivers of virginia his unhappy followers suffered a complication of distresses the scarcity of water and provisions the closeness and filth of the small vessels produced diseases which were fatal to many especially to the negroes though his whole force was trifling when compared with     the resources of virginia yet the want of suitable armed vessels made its expulsion impracticable the experience of that day evinced the inadequacy of land forces for the defence of a maritime country and the extensive mischief which may be done by even an inconsiderable marine when unopposed in its own way the want of a navy was both seen and felt some arrangements to procure one were therefore made either the expectation of an attack from this quarter or the sufferings of the crews on board induced his lordship in the summer      to burn the least valuable of his vessels and to send the remainder amounting to  0 or  0 sail to florida bermuda and the westindies the hopes which lord dunmore had entertained of subduing virginia by the cooperation of the negroes terminated with this movement the unhappy africans who had engaged in it are said to have almost universally perished while these transactions were carrying on another scheme in which lord dunmore was a party in like manner miscarried it was in contemplation to raise a considerable force at the back of the colonies particularly in virginia and the carolinas one connelly a native of pennsylvania was the framer of the design he had gained the approbation of lord dunmore and had been sent by him to general gage at boston and from him he received a commission to act as colonel commandant it was intended that the british garrisons at detroit and some other remote posts with their artillery and ammunition should be subservient to this design connelly also hoped for the aid of the canadians and indians he was authorised to grant commissions and to have the supreme direction of the new     forces as soon as they were in readiness he was to penetrate through virginia and to meet lord dunmore near alexandria on the river potowmac connelly was taken up on suspicion by one of the committees in maryland while on his way to the scene of action the papers found in his possession betrayed the whole among these was a general sketch of the plan and a letter from lord dunmore to one of the indian chiefs       he was imprisoned     and the papers published so many fortunate escapes induced a belief among serious americans that their cause was favoured by heaven the various projects which were devised and put in operation against them pointed out the increasing necessity of union while the havock made on their coasts—the proffer of freedom to their slaves and the encouragement proposed to indians for making war on their frontier inhabitants quickened their resentment against greatbritain northcarolina was more fortunate than virginia the governors of both were perhaps equally zealous for the royal interest and the people of both equally attached to the cause of america but the former escaped with a smaller portion of public calamity several regulations were at this time adopted by most of the provinces councils of safety committees and conventions were common substitutes for regular government similar plans for raising arming and supporting troops and for training the militia were from north to south generally adopted in like manner royal governors throughout the provinces were exerting themselves in attaching the people to the schemes of greatbritain governor martin of northcarolina was particularly zealous in this business he fortified and armed his palace at newbern that it might answer the double purpose of a garrison and magazine while he was thus employed such commotions were excited among the people that he thought it expedient to retire on board a sloop of war in cape fear river the people on examining found powder and various military stores which had been buried in his garden and yard governor martin though he had abandoned his usual place of residence continued his exertions for reducing northcarolina to obedience he particularly addressed himself to the regulators and highland emigrants the former had acquired this name from their attempting to regulate the administration of justice in the remote settlements in a summary manner     subversive of the public peace       they had suffered the consequences of opposing royal government and from obvious principles of human nature were disposed to     support the authority whose power to punish they had recently experienced the highland emigrants had been but a short time in america and were yet more under the influence of european ideas than those which their new situation was calculated to inspire governor martin sent commissions among these people for raising and commanding regiments and he granted one to mr mdonald to act as their general he also sent them a proclamation commanding all persons on their allegiance to repair to the royal standard this was erected by general mdonald about the middle of february upon the first intelligence of their assembling brigadier general moore with some provincial troops and militia and some pieces of cannon marched to oppose them he took possession of rock fish bridge and threw up some works he had not been there many days when mdonald approached and sent a letter to moore enclosing the governors proclamation and advising him and his party to join the kings standard and adding that in case of refusal they must be treated as enemies to this moore replied that he and his officers considered themselves as engaged in a cause the most glorious and honourable in the world the defence of mankind and in his turn offered that if mdonalds party laid down their arms they should be received as friends but otherwise they must expect consequences similar to those which they threatened soon after this general mdonald with his adherents pushed on to join governor martin but colonels lillington and caswell with about  000 militia men took possession of moores creek bridge which lay in their way and raised a small breast work to secure themselves      feb    on the next morning the highland emigrants attacked the militia posted at the bridge but mcleod the second in command and some more of their officers being killed at the first onset they fled with precipitation general mdonald was taken prisoner and the whole of his party broken and dispersed this overthrow produced consequences very injurious to the british interest a royal fleet and army was expected on the coast a     junction formed between them and the highland emigrants in the interior country might have made a sensible impression on the province from an eagerness to do     something the insurgents prematurely took arms and being crushed before the arrival of proper support their spirits were so entirely broken that no future effort could be expected from them while the war raged only in massachusetts each province conducted as under the expectation of being next attacked georgia though a majority of its inhabitants were at first against the measures yet about the middle of this year joined the other colonies having not concurred in the petitions from congress to the king they petitioned by themselves and stated their rights and grievances in firm and decided language they also adopted the continental association and sent on their deputies to congress in southcarolina there was an eagerness to be prepared for defence which was not surpassed in any of the provinces regiments were raised—forts were built—the militia trained and every necessary preparation made for that purpose lord william campbell the royal governor endeavoured to form a party for the support of government and was in some degree successful distrusting his personal safety on shore about the middle of september he took up his residence on board an armed vessel then in the harbour the royal government still existed in name and form but the real power which the people obeyed was exercised by a provincial congress a council of safety and subordinate committees to conciliate the friendship of the indians the popular leaders sent a small supply of powder into their country they who were opposed to congress embodied and robbed the waggons which were employed in its transportation to inflame the minds of their adherents they propagated a report that the powder was intended to be given to the indians for the purpose of massacring the friends of royal government the inhabitants took arms some to support royal government but others to support the american measures       the royalists     acted feebly and were easily overpowered they were disheartened by the superior numbers that opposed them they every where gave way and were obliged either to fly or feign submission solicitations had been made about this time for royal forces to awe the southern provinces but without effect till the proper season was over one scheme for this purpose was frustrated by a singular device private intelligence had been received of an express being sent from sir     james wright governor of georgia to general gage by him the necessity of ordering a part of the royal army to the southward was fully stated the express was waylaid and compelled by two gentle men to deliver his letters one to general gage was kept back and another one forwarded in its room the seal and hand writing were so exactly imitated that the deception was not suspected the forged letter was received and acted upon it stated such a degree of peace and tranquility as induced an opinion that there was no necessity of sending royal troops to the southward while these states were thus left to themselves they had time and opportunity to prepare for extremities and in the mean time the friends of royal government were severally crushed a series of disasters followed the royal cause in the year      general gages army was cooped up in boston and rendered useless in the southern states where a small force would have made an impression the royal governors were unsupported much was done to irritate the colonists and to cement their union but very little either in the way of conquest or concession to subdue their spirits or conciliate their affections   0 in this year the people of america generally took their side every art was made use of by the popular leaders to attach the inhabitants to their royal cause nor were the votaries of the royal interest inactive but little impression was made by the latter except among the uninformed the great mass of the wealth learning and influence in all the southern colonies and in most of the northern was in favour of the american cause some aged persons were exceptions to the contrary       attached to ancient habits and enjoying the fruits of their industry     they were slow in approving new measures subversive of the former and endangering the latter a few who had basked in the sunshine of court favour were restrained by honour principle and interest from forsaking the fountain of their enjoyments some feared the power of britain and others doubted the perseverance of america but a great majority resolved to hazard every thing in preference to a tame submission in the beginning of the year the colonists were farmers merchants and mechanics but in its close they had assumed the profession of soldiers so sudden a transformation of so numerous and so dispersed a people is without a parallel this year was also remarkable for the general termination of royal government this was effected without any violence to its executive officers the new system was not so much forcibly imposed or designedly adopted as introduced through necessity and the imperceptible agency of a common danger operating uniformly on the mind of the public the royal governors for the most part voluntarily abdicated their governments and retired on board ships of war they assigned for reason that they apprehended personal danger but this in every instance was unfounded perhaps these representatives of royalty thought that as they were constitutionally necessary to the administration of justice the horrors of anarchy would deter the people from prosecuting their opposition if they acted from this principle they were mistaken their withdrawing from the exercise of their official duties both furnished an apology and induced a necessity for organising a system of government independent of royal authority by encouraging opposition to the popular measures they involved their friends in great distress the unsuccessful insurrections which they fomented being improperly timed and unsupported were easily overthrown and actually strengthened the popular government which they meant to destroy     history of the american revolution  chapter x fpage    lpage    chapter x transactions in massachusetts and evacuation of boston          as the year      drew near to a close the friends of congress were embarrassed with a new difficulty their army was temporary and only engaged to serve out the year the object for which they had taken up arms was not yet obtained every reason which had previously induced the provinces to embody a military force still existed and with increasing weight it was therefore resolved to form a new army the same flattering hopes were indulged that an army for the ensuing year would answer every purpose a committee of congress consisting of dr franklin mr lynch and mr harrison repaired to head quarters at cambridge and there in conjunction with general washington made arrangements for organizing an army for the year      it was presumed that the spirit which had hitherto operated on the yeomanry of the country would     induce most of the same individuals to engage for another twelvemonth but on experiment it was found that much of their military ardor had already evaporated the first impulse of passion and the novelty of the scene had brought many to the field who had great objections against continuing in the military line they found that to be soldiers required sacrifices of which when they assumed that character they had no idea so unacquainted were the bulk of the people with the mode of carrying on modern war that many of them flew to arms with the delusive expectation of settling the whole dispute by a few decisive and immediate engagements experience soon taught them to risque life in open fighting was but a part of the soldiers duty several of the inferior officers retired—the men frequently refused to enlist unless they were allowed to chuse their officers others would not engage unless they were indulged with furloughs fifty would apply together for leave of absence indulgence threatened less ruinous consequences than a refusal would probably have produced on the whole enlistments went on slowly       though the recruits     for the new army had not arrived yet the connecticut troops whose time expired on the first of december could not be persuaded to continue in service on their way home several of them were stopped by the country people and compelled to return when every thing seemed to be exposed by the departure of so great a part of the late army the militia was called on for a temporary aid a new difficulty obstructed as well the recruiting of the army as the coming in of the militia sundry persons infected with the small pox were sent out of boston and landed at point shirley such was the dread of that disease that the british army scarcely excited equal terror so many difficulties retarded the recruiting service that on the last day of the year      the whole american army amounted to no more than    0 men of the remarkable events with which this important year was replete it was not the least that within musket shot of twenty british regiments one army was disbanded and another enlisted all this time the british troops at boston were suffering the inconvenience of a blockade from the   th of april they were cut off from those refreshments which their situation required their supplies from britain did not reach the coast for a long time after     they were expected several were taken by the american cruisers and others were lost at sea this was in particular the fate of many of their coal ships the want of fuel was peculiarly felt in a climate where the winter is both severe and tedious they relieved themselves in part from their sufferings on this account by the timber of houses which they pulled down and burnt vessels were dispatched to the westindies to procure provisions but the islands were so straitened that they could afford but little assistance armed ships and transports were ordered to georgia with an intent to procure rice but the people of that province with the aid of a party from southcarolina so effectually opposed them that of eleven vessels only two got off safe with their cargoes       it was not till the stock of the garrison was nearly exhausted that the transports from england entered the port of   0 boston and relieved the distresses of the garrison while the troops within the lines were apprehensive of suffering from want of provisions the troops without were equally uneasy for want of employment used to labour and motion on their farms they but illy relished the inactivity and confinement of a camp life fiery spirits declaimed in favour of an assault they preferred a bold spirit of enterprize to that passive fortitude which bears up under present evils while it waits for favorable junctures to be in readiness for an attempt of this kind a council of war recommended to call in    0 militia men from newhampshire or connecticut january   –    this number added to the regular army before boston would have made an operating force of about   000 men the provincials laboured under great inconveniences from the want of arms and ammunition very early in the contest the king of greatbritain by proclamation forbad the exportation of warlike forces to the colonies great exertions had been made to manufacture salt petre and gun powder but the supply was slow and inadequate a secret committee of congress had been appointed with ample powers to lay in a stock of this necessary article some swift sailing vessels had been dispatched to the coast of africa to purchase what could be procured in that distant region a party from charleston forcibly took about   000 lbs of powder from a vessel near the bar of st augustine some time after commodore hopkins stripped providence one of the bahama islands of a quantity of artillery and     stores but the whole procured from all these quarters was far short of a sufficiency in order to supply the new army before boston with the necessary means of defence an application was made to massachusetts for arms but on examination it was found that their public stores afforded only  00 orders were issued to purchase firelocks from private persons but few had any to sell and fewer would part with them in the month of february there were  000 of the american infantry who were destitute of arms       powder was equally scarce and yet daily applications were made for dividends of the small quantity     which was on hand for the defence of various parts threatened with invasion the eastern colonies presented an unusual sight a powerful enemy safely intrenched in their first city while a fleet was ready to transport them to any part of the coast a numerous body of husbandmen was resolutely bent on opposition but without the necessary arms and ammunition for self defence the eyes of all were fixed on general washington and from him it was unreasonably expected that he would by a bold exertion free the town of boston from the british troops the dangerous situation of public affairs led him to conceal the real scarcity of arms and ammunition and with that magnanimity which is characteristical of great minds to suffer his character to be assailed rather than vindicate himself by exposing his many wants there were not wanting persons who judging from the superior numbers of men in the american army boldly asserted that if the commander in chief was not desirous of prolonging his importance at the head of an army he might by a vigorous exertion gain possession of boston such suggestions were reported and believed by several while they were uncontradicted by the general who chose to risque his fame rather than expose his army and his country agreeably to the request of the council of war about  000 of the militia had rendezvoused in february general washington stated to his officers that the troops in camp together with the reinforcements which had been called for and were daily coming in would amount nearly to   000 men—that he had not powder sufficient for a bombardment and asked their advice whether as reinforcements might be daily expected to the enemy it would not be prudent before that event took place to make an assault on the british lines the     proposition was negatived but it was recommended to take possession of dorchester heights to conceal this design and to divert the attention of the garrison a bombardment of the town from other directions commenced and was carried on for three days with as much briskness as a deficient stock of powder would admit       in this first essay      three of the mortars were broken either from a defect in their construction or more probably from ignorance of the proper mode of using them the night of the  th of march was fixed upon for taking possession of dorchester heights a covering party of about  00 men led the way these were followed by the carts with the intrenching tools and   00 of a working party commanded by general thomas in the rear there were more than  00 carts loaded with fascines and hay in bundles while the cannon were playing in other parts the greatest silence was kept by this working party the active zeal of the industrious provincials completed lines of defence by the morning which astonished the garrison the difference between dorchester heights on the evening of the  th and the morning of the  th seemed to realise the tales of romance the admiral informed general howe that if the americans kept possession of these heights he would not be able to keep one of his majestys ships in the harbour it was therefore determined in a council of war to attempt to dislodge them an engagement was hourly expected it was intended by general washington in that case to force his way into boston with  000 men who were to have embarked at the mouth of cambridge river the militia had come forward with great alertness each bringing three days provision in expectation of an immediate assault the men were in high spirits and impatiently waiting for the appeal they were reminded that it was the  th of march and were called upon to avenge the death of their countrymen killed on that day the many eminences in and near boston which overlooked the ground on which it was expected that the contending parties would engage were crouded with numerous spectators but general howe did not intend to attack till the next day in order to be ready for it the transports went down in the evening towards the castle in the night a most violent storm and towards morning a heavy flood of rain came on       a carnage was thus providentially prevented that     would probably have equalled if not exceeded the fatal       th of june at bunkershill in this situation it was agreed by the british in a council of war to evacuate the town as soon as possible in a few days after a flag came out of boston with a paper signed by four select men informingthat they had applied to general robertson who on application to general howe was authorised to assure them that he had no intention of burning the town unless the troops under his command were molested during their embarkation or at their departure by the armed force without when this paper was presented to general washington he replied that as it was an unauthenticated paper and without an address and not obligatory on general howe he could take no notice of it but at the same time intimated his good wishes for the security of the town a proclamation was issued by general howe ordering all woollen and linen goods to be delivered to crean brush esq shops were opened and stripped of their goods a licentious plundering took place much was carried off and more was wantonly destroyed these irregularities were forbidden in orders and the guilty threatened with death but nevertheless every mischief which disappointed malice could suggest was committed march    the british amounting to more than  000 men evacuated boston leaving their barracks standing and also a number of pieces of cannon spiked four large iron sea mortars and stores to the value of £  0000 they demolished the castle and knocked off the trunnions of the cannon various incidents caused a delay of nine days after the evacuation before they left nantasket road this embarkation was attended with many circumstances of distress and embarrassment on the departure of the royal army from boston a great number of the inhabitants attached to their sovereign and afraid of public resentment chose to abandon their country from the great multitude about to depart there was no possibility of procuring purchasers for their furniture neither was there a sufficiency of vessels for its convenient transportation mutual jealousy subsisted between the     army and navy each charging the other as the cause of some part of their common distress the army was full of discontent reinforcements though long promised had not arrived both officers and soldiers thought themselves neglected     five months had elapsed since they had received any advice of their destination wants and inconveniencies increased their ill humour their intended voyage to halifax subjected them to great dangers the coast at all times hazardous was eminently so at that tempestuous equinoctial season they had reason to fear they would be blown off to the westindies and without a sufficient stock of provisions they were also going to a barren country to add to their difficulties this dangerous voyage when completed was directly so much out of their way their business lay to the southward and they were going northward under all these difficulties and with all these gloomy prospects the fleet steered for halifax contrary to appearances the voyage thither was both short and prosperous they remained there for some time waiting for reinforcements and instructions from england when the royal fleet and army departed from boston several ships were left behind for the protection of vessels coming from england but the american privateers were so alert that they nevertheless made many prizes some of the vessels which they captured were laden with arms and warlike stores some transports with troops on board were also taken these had run into the harbour not knowing that the place was evacuated the boats employed in the embarkation of the british troops had scarcely completed their business when general washington with his army marched into boston he was received with marks of approbation more flattering than the pomps of a triumph the inhabitants released from the severities of a garrison life and from the various indignities to which they were subjected hailed him as their deliverer reciprocal congratulations between those who had been confined within the british lines and those who were excluded from entering them were exchanged with an ardor which cannot be discribed       general washington     was honoured by congress with a vote of thanks they also ordered a medal to be struck with suitable devices to perpetuate the remembrance of the great event the massachusetts council and house of representatives complimented him in a joint address in which they expressed their good wishes in the following words may you still go on approved by heaven—revered by all good men and dreaded by those tyrants who claim their fellow men as their property his answer was modest and proper     the evacuation of boston had been previously determined upon by the british ministry from principles of political expedience being resolved to carry on the war for purposes affecting all the colonies they conceived a central position to be preferable to boston reasoning of this kind had induced the adoption of the measure but the american works on roxbury expedited its execution the abandonment of their friends and the withdrawing their forces from boston was the first act of a tragedy in which evacuations and retreats were the scenes which most frequently occurred and the epilogue of which was a total evacuation of the united states     history of the american revolution  chapter xi fpage    lpage    chapter xi transactions in canada the tide of good fortune which in the autumn of      flowed in upon general montgomery induced congress to reinforce the army under his command chamblee st johns and montreal having surrendered to the americans a fair prospect opened of expelling the british from canada and of annexing that province to the united colonies while they were in imagination anticipating these events the army in which they confided was defeated and the general whom they adored was killed jan         the intelligence transmitted from general montgomery previous to his assault on quebec encouraged congress to resolve that nine battalions should be kept up and maintained in canada the repulse of their army     though discouraging did not extinguish the ardor of the americans it was no sooner known at headquarters in cambridge than general washington convened a   0 council of war by which it was resolved that as no troops could be spared from cambridge the colonies of massachusetts connecticut and newhampshire should be requested to raise three regiments and forward them to canada jan     congress also resolved to forward the reinforcements previously voted and to raise four battalions in newyork for the defence of that colony and to garrison crownpoint and the several posts to the southward of that fortress that the army might be supplied with blankets for this winter expedition a committee was appointed to procure from householders such as could be spared from their families to obtain a supply of hard money for the use of the army in canada proper persons were employed to exchange paper money for specie such was the enthusiasm of the times that many thousand mexican dollars were freely exchanged at par by individuals for the paper bills of congress it was also resolved to raise a corps of artillery for this service and to take into the pay of the colonies one thousand canadians in addition to colonel livingstons regiment moses hazen a native of massachusetts who had resided many years in canada was appointed to the command of this new corps jan    congress addressed a letter to the canadians in which they observed such is the lot of human nature that the best of causes are subject to vicissitudes but generous souls enlightened and warmed with the fire of liberty become more resolute as difficulties increase they stated to them that eight battalions were raising to proceed to their province and that if more force was necessary it should be sent they requested them to seize with eagerness the favourable opportunity then offered to cooperate in the present glorious enterprise and they advised them to establish associations in their different parishes—to elect deputies for forming a provincial assembly and for representing them in congress the cause of the americans had received such powerful aid from many patriotic publications in their gazettes     and from the fervent exhortations of popular preachers connecting the cause of liberty with the animating principles of religion       that it was determined to employ these two powerful instruments of revolutions—printing and preaching to operate on the minds of the canadians a complete apparatus for printing together with a printer and a clergyman were therefore sent into canada     congress also appointed dr franklin mr chase and mr carrol the two first of whom were members of their body and the last a respectable gentleman of the roman catholic persuasion to proceed to canada with the view of gaining over the people of that colony to the cause of america and authorised them to promise on behalf of the united colonies that canada should be received into their association on equal terms and also that the inhabitants thereof should enjoy the free exercise of their religion and the peaceable possession of all their ecclesiastical property the desire of effecting something decisive in canada before the approaching spring would permit relief to ascend the river st lawrence added to the enthusiasm of the day encountered difficulties which in less animated times would be reckoned unsurmountable arthur st clair who was appointed colonel of one of the pennsylvania regiments received his recruiting orders on the  0th of january and notwithstanding the shortness of the period his regiment was not only raised but six companies of it had in this extreme cold season completed their march from pennsylvania to canada a distance of several hundred miles and on the eleventh of april following joined the american army before quebec though congress and the states made great exertions to support the war in canada yet from the fall of montgomery their interest in that colony daily declined the reduction of quebec was an object to which their resources were inadequate their unsuccessful assault on quebec made an impression both on the canadians and indians unfavorable to their views       a woman infected with the smallpox had either been sent out or voluntarily came out of quebec and by mixing with the american soldiers     propagated that scourge of the new world to the great diminution of the effective force of their army the soldiers inoculated themselves though their officers issued positive orders to the contrary by the first of may so many new troops had arrived that the american army in name amounted to  000 but from the prevalence of the smallpox there were only  00 fit for duty the increasing number of invalids retarded their military operations and discouraged their friends while the opposite party was buoyed up with the expectation that the advancing season would soon bring them relief to these causes of the declining interest of congress it must be added that the affections of the canadians were     alienated they had many and well founded complaints against the american soldiers unrestrained by the terror of civil law and refusing obedience to a military code the hope of impunity and the love of plunder led many of the invading army to practices not less disgraceful to themselves than injurious to the cause in which they had taken arms not only the common soldiers but the officers of the american army deviated in their intercourse with the canadians from the maxims of sound policy several of them having been lately taken from obscure life were giddy with their exaltation far from home they were unawed by those checks which commonly restrain the ferocity of man the reduction of chamblee st johns and montreal together with the exposed situation of quebec being known in england measures were without delay adopted by the british ministry to introduce into canada as soon as possible a force sufficient for the double purpose of recovering what they had lost and of prosecuting offensive operations from that quarter against the revolted colonies may    the van of this force made good its passage very early in the spring through the ice up the river st lawrence the expectation of their coming had for some time damped the hopes of the besiegers and had induced them to think of a retreat the day before the first of the british reinforcements arrived that measure was resolved upon by a council of war and arrangements were made for carrying it into execution           governor carleton was too great a proficient in the art of war to delay seizing the advantages which the consternation of the besiegers and the arrival of a reinforcement afforded a small detachment of soldiers and marines from the ships which had just ascended the river st lawrence being landed and joined to the garrison in quebec he marched out at their head to attack the americans on his approach he found every thing in confusion the late besiegers abandoning their artillery and military stores had in great precipitation retreated in this manner at the expiration of five months the mixed siege and blockade of quebec was raised the fortitude and perseverance of the garrison reflected honour on both officers and privates the reputation acquired by general carleton in his military char acter     for bravely and judiciously defending the province committed to his care was exceeded by the superior applause merited from his exercise of the virtues of humanity and generosity among the numerous sick in the american hospitals several incapable of being moved were left behind may  0  the victorious general proved himself worthy of success by his treatment of these unfortunate men he not only fed and cloathed them but permitted them when recovered to return home apprehending that fear might make some conceal themselves in the woods rather than by applying for relief make themselves known he removed their doubts by a proclamation in which he engaged that as soon as their health was restored they should have free liberty of returning to the respective provinces this humane line of conduct was more injurious to the view of the leaders in the american councils than the severity practised by other british commanders the truly politic as well as humane general carleton dismissed these prisoners after liberally supplying their wants with a recommendation to go home mind their farms and keep themselves and their neighbours from all participation in the unhappy war      the small force which arrived at quebec early in may was followed by several british regiments together with   0 the brunswic troops in such a rapid succession that in a few weeks the whole was estimated at   000 men the americans retreated forty five miles before they stopped after a short halt they proceeded to the sorel at which place they threw up some slight works for their safety they were there joined by some battalions coming to reinforce them about this time general thomas the commander in chief in canada was seized with the small pox and died having forbidden his men to inoculate he conformed to his rule and refused to avail himself of that precaution on his death the command devolved at first on general arnold and afterwards on general sullivan it soon became evident that the americans must abandon the whole province of canada from a desire to do something which might counterbalance in the minds of the canadians the unfavorable impression which this farther retreat would communicate general thomson projected an attack on the british post at the three rivers this lies about half     way between quebec and montreal and is so called from the vicinity of one of the branches of a large river whose waters are discharged through three mouths into the st lawrence with this view a detachment of six hundred men was put under the command of colonel st clair at their head he advanced to the village of nicolette when every thing was ready for the enterprise intelligence was received that six transports escorted by two frigates from quebec had arrived and brought a large addition to the late force at the three rivers this caused some new movements and a delay till more troops could be brought forward general thomson then came on with a reinforcement and took the command of the whole it was determined to make the proposed attack in four different places at the same time one division commanded by colonel wayne was to gain the eastern extremity of the town one commanded by colonel maxwell was to enter from the northward about the center and the other two divisions commanded by colonels sinclair and irvine were to enter from the westward       the whole     having embarked at midnight landed at the point du lac about three hours before day at some distance from this point there are two ways of approaching three rivers one by a road that leads along the banks of the st lawrence the other by a road almost parallel but at a considerable distance it had been determined to advance on the last intelligence was brought to general thomson soon after his landing that a party of   or  00 men were posted at three miles distance the troops were instantly put in motion to dislodge them the intelligence proved to be false but it had carried the detachment some distance beyond the point where the roads separated to have returned would have consumed time that could not be spared as the day was fast approaching it was therefore resolved to proceed in a diagonal direction towards the road they had left after being much retarded by very difficult grounds they arrived at a morass which seemed impassable here the day broke when they were six miles from the object general thomson suspecting the fidelity of his guides put them under arrest—reversed the order of his march and again reached the road by the river he had advanced but a small distance before he was fired upon by two armed vessels all expectation of succeeding by surprise was now at an end it was therefore instantly     determined to make an open attack the sun was rising the drums were ordered to beat and the troops moved on with the greatest alacrity having advanced three miles farther the ships of war began to fire on them the american officer who led the advance struck into a road on the left which also led to the town and was covered from the fire of the ships this last road was circuitous and led through a vast tract of woodland at that season almost impassable he nevertheless entered the wood and the rest of the detachment followed after incredible labour and wading a rivulet breast deep they gained the open country north of the village a party of the british were soon discovered about a mile to the left of the americans and between them and the town colonel wayne ardent for action immediately attacked them the onset was gallant     and vigorous but the contest was unequal       the americans were soon repulsed and forced to retreat in the beginning of the action general thomson left the main body of his corps to join that which was engaged the woods were so thick that it was difficult for any person in motion after losing sight of an object to recover it the general therefore never found his way back the situation of colonel st clair the next in command became embarrassing in his opinion a retreat was necessary but not knowing the precise situation of his superior officer and every moment expecting his return he declined giving orders for that purpose at last when the british were discovered on the river road advancing in a direction to gain the rear of the americans colonel st clair in the absence of gen thomson ordered a retreat this was made by treading back their steps through the same dismal swamp by which they had advanced the british marched directly for the point du lac with the expectation of securing the american batteaux on their approach major wood in whose care they had been left retired with them to the sorel at the point du lac the british halted and took a very advantageous position as soon as it was discovered that the americans had retired a party of the british pursued them when the former arrived near the place of their embarkation they found a large party of their enemies posted in their front at the same time that another was only three quarters of a mile in their rear here was a new and trying dilemma and but little time left for consideration there was an immediate necessity     either to lay down their arms or attempt by a sudden march to turn the party in front and get into the country beyond it the last was thought practicable colonel st clair having some knowledge of the country from his having served in it in the preceding war gave them a route by the acadian village where the river de loups is fordable they had not advanced far when colonel st clair found himself unable to proceed from a wound occasioned by a root which had penetrated through his shoe       his men offered to carry him but this generous proposal was declined     he and two or three officers who having been worn down with fatigue remained behind with him found an asylum under cover of a large tree which had been blown up by the roots they had not been long in this situation when they heard a firing from the british in almost all directions they nevertheless lay still and in the night stole off from the midst of surrounding foes they were now pressed with the importunate cravings of hunger for they were entering on the third day without food after wandering for some time they accidentally found some peasants who entertained them with great hospitality in a few days they joined the army at sorel and had the satisfaction to find that the greatest part of the detachment had arrived safe before them in their way through the country although they might in almost every step of it have been made prisoners and had reason to fear that the inhabitants from the prospect of reward would have been tempted to take them yet they met with neither injury nor insult general thomson was not so fortunate after having lost the troops and falling in with colonel irwine and some other officers they wandered the whole night in thick swamps without being able to find their way out failing in their attempts to gain the river they had taken refuge in a house and were there made prisoners the british forces having arrived and a considerable body of them having rendezvoused at the three rivers a serious pursuit of the american army commenced had sir guy carleton taken no pains to cut off their retreat and at once attacked their post or rather their fortified camp at sorel it would probably have fallen into his hands but either the bold though unsuccessful attack at the three rivers had taught him to respect them or he wished to reduce them without bloodshed in the pursuit he made three divisions of his     army and arranged them so as to embrace the whole american encampment and to command it in every part the retreat was delayed so long that the americans evacuated sorel only about two hours before one division of the british made its appearance           while the americans were retreating they were daily assailed by the remonstrances of the inhabitants of canada who had either joined or befriended them great numbers of canadians had taken a decided part in their favour rendered them essential services and thereby incurred the heavy penalties annexed to the crime of supporting rebellion these though congress had assured them but a few months before that they would never abandon them to the fury of their common enemies were from the necessity of the case left exposed to the resentment of their provincial rulers several of them with tears in their eyes expostulated with the retreating army and bewailing their hard fate prayed for support the only relief the americans could offer was an assurance of continued protection if they retreated with them but this was a hard alternative to men who had wives children and immovable effects they generally concluded that it was the least of two evils to cast themselves on the mercy of that government against which they had offended the distresses of the retreating army were great the british were close on their rear and threatening them with destruction the unfurnished state of the colonies in point of ordnance imposed a necessity of preserving their cannon the men were obliged to drag their loaded batteaus up the rapids by mere strength and when they were to the middle in water the retreating army was also incumbered with great numbers labouring under the smallpox and other diseases two regiments at one time had not a single man in health another had only six and a fourth only forty and two more were in nearly the same condition to retreat in face of an enemy is at all times hazardous but on this occasion it was attended with an unusual proportion of embarrassments general sullivan who conducted the retreat nevertheless acted with so much judgment and propriety that the baggage and public stores were saved and the numerous sick brought off the american army reached crownpoint on the first of july and at that place made their first stand               a short time before the americans evacuated the province of canada general arnold convened the merchants of montreal and proposed to them to furnish a quantity of specified articles for the use of the army in the service of congress while they were deliberating on the subject he placed centinels at their shop doors and made such arrangements that what was at first only a request operated as a command a great quantity of goods were taken on pretence that they were wanted for the use of the american army but in their number were many articles only serviceable to women and to persons in civil life his nephew soon after opened a store in albany and publicly disposed of goods which had been procured at montreal the possession of canada so eminently favoured the plans of defence adopted by congress that the province was evacuated with great reluctance the americans were not only mortified at the disappointment of their favourite scheme of annexing it as a fourteenth link in the chain of their confederacy but apprehended the most serious consequences from the ascending of the british power in that quarter anxious to preserve a footing there they had persevered for a long time in stemming the tide of unfavorable events jun    general gates was about this time appointed to command in canada but on coming to the knowledge of the late events in that province he concluded to stop short within the limits of newyork the scene was henceforth reversed instead of meditating the recommencement of offensive operations that army which had lately excited so much terror in canada was called upon to be prepared for repelling an invasion threatened from that province the attention of the americans being exclusively fixed on plans of defence their general officers commanding in the northern department were convened to deliberate on the place and means most suitable for that purpose to form a judgment on this subject a recollection of the events of the late war between france and england was of advantage the same ground was to be fought over     and the same posts to be again contended for on the confines of lake george and lake champlain two inland seas which stretch almost from the sources of hudsons river to the st lawrence are     situated the famous posts of ticonderoga and crownpoint these are of primary necessity to any power which contends for the possession of the adjacent country for they afford the most convenient stand either for its annoyance or defence in the opinion of some american officers crownpoint to which the army on the evacuation of canada had retreated was the most proper place for erecting works of defence but it was otherwise determined by the council convened on this occasion it was also by their advice resolved to move lower down and to make the principal work on the strong ground east of ticonderoga and especially by every means to endeavour to maintain a naval superiority in lake champlain in conformity to these resolutions general gates with about   000 men which collected in the course of the summer was fixed in command of ticonderoga and a fleet was constructed at skenesborough august     this was carried on with so much rapidity that in a short time there were afloat in lake champlain one sloop three schooners and six gondolas carrying in the whole    guns    swivels and   0 men six other vessels were also nearly ready for launching at the same time the fleet was put under the command of general arnold and he was instructed by general gates to proceed beyond crownpoint down lake champlain to the split rock but most peremptorily restrained from advancing any farther as security against an apprehended invasion was the ultimate end of the armament the expulsion of the american invaders from canada was but a part of the british designs in that quarter they urged the pursuit no farther than st johns but indulged the hope of being soon in a condition for passing the lakes and penetrating through the country to albany so as to form a communication with newyork the objects they had in view were great and the obstacles in the way of their accomplishment equally so           before they could advance with any prospect of success a fleet superior to that of the americans on the lakes was to be constructed the materials of some large vessels were for this purpose brought from england but their transportation and the labour necessary to put them together required both time and patience the spirit of the british commanders rose in proportion to the difficulties which were to be encountered nevertheless it was so late as the month of october before their   0 fleet was prepared to face the american naval force on lake champlain the former consisted of the ship inflexible mounting    twelve pounders which was so expeditiously constructed that she sailed from st johns    days after laying her keel one schooner mounting    and another    six pounders a flat bottomed radeau carrying six    and six    pounders besides howitzers and a gondola with seven nine pounders there were also twenty smaller vessels with brass field pieces from   to    pounders or with howitzers some long boats were furnished in the same manner an equal number of large boats acted as tenders besides these vessels of war there was a vast number destined for the transportation of the army its stores artillery baggage and provisions the whole was put under the command of captain pringle the naval force of the americans from the deficiency of means was far short of what was brought against them their principal armed vessel was a schooner which mounted only    six and four pounders and their whole fleet in addition to this consisted of only fifteen vessels of inferior force no one step could be taken towards accomplishing the designs of the british on the northern frontiers of newyork till they had the command of lake champlain oct     with this view their fleet proceeded up the lake and engaged the americans the wind was so unfavorable to the british that their ship inflexible and some other vessel of force could not be brought to action this lessened the inequality between the contending fleets so much that the principal damage sustained by the americans was the loss of a schooner and gondola       at the     approach of night the action was discontinued the vanquished took the advantage which the darkness afforded to make their escape this was effected by general arnold with great judgment and ability by the next morning the whole fleet under his command was out of sight the british pursued with all the sail they could croud the wind having become more favorable they overtook the americans and brought them to action near crownpoint oct     a smart engagement ensued and was well supported on both sides for about two hours some of the american vessels which were most ahead escaped to ticonderoga two gallies and five gondolas remained and resisted an unequal force with a spirit approaching to desperation one of the gallies struck and was taken general arnold though he     knew that to escape was impossible and to resist unavailing yet instead of surrendering determined that his people should not become prisoners nor his vessels a reinforcement to the british this spirited resolution was executed with a judgment equal to the boldness with which it had been adopted he ran the congress galley on board of which he was together with the five gondolas on shore in such a position as enabled him to land his men and blow up the vessels in the execution of this perilous enterprise he paid a romantic attention to a point of honour he did not quit his own galley till she was in flames lest the british should board her and strike his flag the result of this action though unfavorable to the americans raised the reputation of general arnold higher than ever in addition to the fame of a brave soldier he acquired that of an able sea officer the american naval force being nearly destroyed the british had undisputed possession of lake champlain on this event a few continental troops which had been at crownpoint retired to their main body at ticonderoga general carleton took possession of the ground from which they had retreated and was there soon joined by his army he sent out several reconnoitering parties and at one time pushed forward a strong detachment on both sides of the lake which approached near     to ticonderoga       some british vessels appeared at the same time within cannon shot of the american works at that place it is probable he had it in contemplation if circumstances favoured to reduce the post and that the apparent strength of the works restrained him from making the attempt and induced his return to canada such was the termination of the northern campaign in      though after the surrender of montreal evacuations defeats and retreats had almost uninterruptedly been the portion of the americans yet with respect to the great object of defence on the one side and of conquest on the other a whole campaign was gained to them and lost to their adversaries the british had cleared canada of its invaders and destroyed the american fleet on the lakes yet from impediments thrown in their way they failed in their ulterior designs the delays contrived by general gates retarded the british for so great a part of the summer     that by the time they had reached ticonderoga their retreat on account of the approaching winter became immediately necessary on the part of the americans some men and a few armed vessels were lost but time was gained their army saved and the frontier of the adjacent states secured from a projected invasion on the part of the british the object of a campaign in which   000 men were employed and near a million of money expended was rendered in a great measure abortive     history of the american revolution  chapter xii fpage    lpage  0 chapter xii the proceedings of parliament against the colonies     –  operations in southcarolina newyork and newjersey the operations carried on against the united colonies in the year      were adapted to cases of criminal combination among subjects not in arms the military arrangements for that year were therefore made on the idea of a trifling addition to a peace establishment   0       it was either not known that a majority of the americans had determined to resist the power of greatbritain rather than submit to the late coercive laws or it was not believed that they had spirit sufficient to act in conformity to that determination the propensity in human nature to believe that to be true which is wished to be so had deceived the royal servants in america and the british ministry in england so far as to induce their general belief that a determined spirit on the part of government and a few thousand troops to support that determination would easily compose the troubles in america their military operations in the year      were therefore calculated on the small scale of strengthening the     civil power and not on the large one of resisting an organised army though it had been declared by parliament in february      that a rebellion existed in massachusetts yet it was not believed that the colonists would dare to abet their opposition by an armed force the resistance made by the militia at lexington the consequent military arrangements adopted first by massachusetts and afterwards by congress together with the defence of bunkershill all conspired to prove that the americans were far from being contemptible adversaries the nation finding itself by a fatal progression of the unhappy dispute involved in a civil war was roused to recollection though several corporate bodies and sundry distinguished individuals in greatbritain were opposed to coercive measures yet there was a majority for proceeding the pride of the nation was interested in humbling the colonists who had dared to resist the power which had lately triumphed over the combined force of france and spain the prospect of freeing their own estates from a part of the heavy taxes charged thereon induced numbers of the landed gentlemen in greatbritain to support the same measures they conceived the coercion of the colonies to be the most direct mode of securing their contribution towards sinking the national debt       influenced by these opinions such not only justified the adoption of rigorous measures but chearfully consented to present additional taxes with the same spirit     which induces litigants in private life to advance money for forwarding a lawsuit from the termination of which great profits are expected lord north the prime minister of england finding himself supported by so many powerful interests was encouraged to proceed he had already subdued a powerful party in the city of london and triumphed over the eastindia company the submission of the colonies was only wanting to complete the glory of his administration previous success emboldened him to attempt the arduous business he flattered himself that the accomplishment of it would not only restore peace to the empire but give a brilliancy to his name far exceeding that of any of his predecessors such was the temper of a great part of the nation and such the ambitious views of its prime minister when the parliament was convened on the   th of october      in the speech from the throne great complaints were made of the leaders in the colonies who were said by their misrepresentatives to have infused into the     minds of the deluded multitude opinions repugnant to their constitutional subordination and afterwards to have proceeded to the commencement of hostilities and the usurpation of the whole powers of government his majesty also charged his subjects in america with meaning only to amuse by vague expressions of attachment to the parent state while they were preparing for a general revolt and he farther asserted that the rebellious war now levied by them was become more general and manifestly carried on for the purpose of establishing an independent empire and that it was become the art of wisdom and in its effects of clemency to put a speedy end to these disorders by the most decisive exertions information was also given that the most friendly offers of foreign assistance had been received and that his majestys electoral troops were sent to the garrison of gibraltar and port mahon in order that a large number of the established forces of the kingdom might be applied to the maintenance of its authority       the severity of these assertions was mitigated by a declaration that when the unhappy and deluded multitude against     whom this force should be directed would become sensible of their error his majesty would be ready to receive the misled with tenderness and mercy and that to prevent inconveniences he should give authority to certain persons on the spot to grant general or particular pardons and indemnities to such as should be disposed to return to their allegiance the sentiments expressed in this speech and the heavy charges therein laid against the colonists were reechoed in addresses to the king from both houses of parliament but not without a spirited protest in the house of lords in this nineteen dissenting members asserted the american war to be unjust and impolitic in its principles and fatal in its consequences they also declared that they could not consent to an address which might deceive his majesty and the public into a belief of the confidence of their house in the present ministers who had disgraced parliament deceived the nation—lost the colonies and involved them in a civil war against their clearest interests and upon the most unjustifiable grounds wantonly spilling the blood of thousands of their fellow subjects the sanction of parliament being obtained for a vigorous prosecution of the american war estimates for the public service were agreed to on the idea of operating against the colonies as an hostile     armed foreign power to this end it was voted to employ   000 seamen and    00 land forces and the sanction of authority was not long after given to measures for engaging foreign mercenaries no ministry had in any preceding war exerted themselves more to prosecute military operations against alien enemies than the present to make the ensuing campaign decisive of the dispute between the mother country and the colonies nov  0       one legislative act was still wanting to give full efficacy to the intended prosecution of hostilities this was brought into parliament in a bill interdicting all trade and intercourse with the thirteen united colonies by it all property of americans whether of ships or goods on the high seas or in harbour was declared to be forfeited to the captors being the officers and crews of his majestys ships of war it farther enacted     that the masters crews and other persons found on board captured american vessels should be entered on board his majestys vessels of war and there considered to be in his majestys service to all intents and purposes as if they had entered of their own accord this bill also authorised the crown to appoint commissioners who over and above granting pardons to individuals were empowered to enquire into general and particular grievances and to determine whether any colony or part of a colony was returned to that state of obedience which might entitle it to be received within the kings peace and protection in that case upon a declaration from the commissioners the restrictions of the proposed law were to cease it was said in favour of this bill that as the americans were already in a state of war it became necessary that hostilities should be carried on against them as was usual against alien enemies that the more vigorously and extensively military operations were prosecuted the sooner would peace and order be restored that as the commissioners went out with the sword in one hand and terms of conciliation in the other it was in the power of the colonists to prevent the infliction of any real or apparent severities in the proposed statute in opposition to it it was said that treating the americans as a foreign nation was chalking out the way for their independence     one member observed that as the indiscriminate rapine of property authorised by the bill would oblige the colonists to coalesce as one man its title ought to be a bill for carrying more effectually into execution the resolves of congress the clause for vesting the property of the seizures in the captors was reprobated as tending to extinguish in the breasts of seamen the principles of patriotism—of national pride and glory and to substitute in their room habits of cruelty of piracy and robbery but of all parts of this bill none was so severely condemned as that clause by which persons taken on board the american vessels were indiscriminately compelled to serve as common sailors in british ships of war this was said to be a refinement of     tyranny worse than death       it was also said that no man could be despoiled of his goods as a foreign enemy and at the same time obliged to serve as a citizen and that compelling captives to bear arms against their families kindred friends and country—and after being plundered themselves to become accomplices in plundering their brethren was unexampled except among pirates the outlaws and enemies of human society to all these high charges the ministry replied that the measure was an act of grace and favour for said they the crews of american vessels instead of being put to death the legal punishment of their demerits as traitors and rebels are by this law to be rated on the kings books and treated as if they were on the same footing with a great body of his most useful and faithful subjects it was also said that their pay and emoluments in the service of their lawful sovereign would be a compensation for all scruples that might arise from the supposed violation of their principles in the progress of the debates on this bill lord mansfield declared that the questions of original right and wrong were no longer to be considered—that they were engaged in a war and must use their utmost efforts to obtain the ends proposed by it that they must either fight or be pursued and that the justice of the cause must give way to their present situation perhaps no speech in or out of parliament operated more extensively on the irritated minds of the colonists than this one the great abilities and profound legal knowledge of lord mansfield     were both known and admired in america that this illustrious oracle of law should declare from the seat of legislation that the justice of the cause was no longer to be regarded excited the astonishment and cemented the union of the colonists greatbritain said they has commenced war against us for maintaining our constitutional liberties and her lawgivers now declare they must proceed without any retrospect to the merits of the original ground of dispute our peace and happiness must be sacrificed to british honour and consistency in their continuing to prosecute     an unjust invasion of our rights dec          a number of lords as usual entered a spirited protest against the bill but it was carried by a great majority in both houses of parliament and soon after received the royal assent this law arrived in the colonies in march      the effects resulting from it were such as had been predicted by its opposers it not only united the colonies in resisting greatbritain but produced a favorable opinion of independence in the minds of thousands who previously reprobated that measure it was considered from newhampshire to georgia as a legal discharge from allegiance to their native sovereign what was wanting to produce a decided majority of the party for breaking off all connexion with greatbritain was speedily obtained from the irritation excited by the hiring of foreign troops to fight against the colonists this measure was nearly coincident with the ratification of the prohibitory law just mentioned and intelligence of both arrived in the colonies about the same time the treaties which had been lately concluded with the landgrave of hesse cassel the duke of brunswic and the hereditary prince of hesse cassel for hiring their troops to the king of greatbritain to be employed in the american service being laid before the house of commons a motion was made thereon for referring them to the committee of supply feb          this occasioned a very interesting debate on the propriety of employing foreign troops against the americans the measure was supported on the necessity of prosecuting the war and the impracticability of raising a sufficient number of domestic levies it was also urged that foreign troops inspired with the military maxims and ideas of implicit submission would be less apt to be biassed by that false lenity which native soldiers might indulge at the expence of national interest it was said     are we to sit still and suffer an unprovoked rebellion to terminate in the formation of an independent hostile empire are we to suffer our colonies the object of the great national expence and of two bloody wars to be lost forever to us and given away to strangers from a scruple of           employing foreign troops to preserve our just rights over colonies for which we have paid so dear a purchase as the americans by refusing the obedience and taxes of subjects deny themselves to be a part of the british empire and make themselves foreigners they cannot complain that foreigners are employed against them on the other side the measure was severely condemned the necessity of the war was denied and the nation was represented as disgraced by applying to the petty princes of germany for succours against her own rebellious subjects the tendency of the example to induce the americans to form alliances with foreign powers was strongly urged it was said hitherto the colonists have ventured to commit themselves singly in this arduous contest without having recourse to foreign aid but it is not to be doubted that in future they will think themselves fully justified both by our example and the laws of self preservation to engage foreigners to assist them in opposing those mercenaries whom we are about to transport for their destruction nor is it doubtful that in case of their application european powers of a rank far superior to that of those petty princes to whom we have so abjectly sued for aid will consider themselves to be equally entitled to interfere in the quarrel between us and our colonies the supposition of the americans receiving aid from france or spain was on this and several other occasions ridiculed on the idea that these powers would not dare to set to their own colonies the dangerous example of encouraging those of greatbritain in opposing their sovereign it was also supposed that they would be influenced by considerations of future danger to their american possessions from the establishment of an independent empire in their vicinity in this session of parliament between the   th of october      and the   d of may      the ultimate plan for reducing the colonies was completely fixed the americans were declared out of the royal protection and   000 foreign mercenaries employed by national   0 authority to effect their subjugation       these measures     induced congress in the following summer to declare themselves independent and to seek for foreign aid events which shall be hereafter more fully explained parliamentary sanction for carrying on the war against the colonists as against alien enemies being obtained it became necessary to fix on a commander of the royal forces to be employed on this occasion this as a matter of right was in the first instance offered to general oglethorpe as being the first on the list of general officers to the surprise of the minister that respectable veteran readily accepted the command on condition of his being properly supported a numerous well appointed army and a powerful fleet were promised him to which he replied i will undertake the business without a man or a ship of war provided you will authorise me to assure the colonists on my arrival among them that you will do them justice he added farther i know the people of america well and am satisfied that his majesty has not in any part of his dominions more obedient or more loyal subjects you may secure their obedience by doing them justice but you will never subdue them by force of arms these opinions so favourable to the americans proved general oglethorpe to be an improper person for the purpose intended by the british ministry he was therefore passed over and the command given to sir william howe it was resolved to open the campaign with such a powerful force as would look down all opposition and effectuate submission without bloodshed and to direct its operations to the accomplishment of three objects the first was the relief of quebec and the recovery of canada which also included a subsequent invasion of the northwestern frontiers of the adjacent provinces the second was a strong impression on some of the southern colonies the third and principal was to take possession of newyork with a force sufficiently powerful to keep possession of hudsonsriver and form a line of communication with the royal army in canada or to overrun the adjacent country the partial success of the first part of this plan has been in the preceding chapter explained the execution     of the second part was committed to general clinton and sir peter parker the former     with a small force having called at newyork and also visited in virginia lord dunmore the late royal governor of that colony and finding that nothing could be done at either place proceeded to capefearriver at that place he issued a proclamation from on board the pallas transport offering free pardon to all such as should lay down their arms excepting cornelius hasnett and robert howe but the recent defeat of the regulators and highlanders restrained even their friends from paying any attention to this act of grace at capefear a junction was formed between sir henry clinton and sir peter parker the latter of whom had sailed with his squadron directly from europe they concluded to attempt the reduction of charleston as being of all places within the line of their instructions the object at which they could strike with the greatest prospect of advantage they had   00 land forces which they hoped with the cooperation of their shipping would be fully sufficient for some months past every exertion had been made to put the colony of southcarolina and especially its capital charleston in a respectable posture of defence in subserviency to this view works had been erected on sullivans island which is situated so near the channel leading up to the town as to be a convenient post for annoying vessels approaching it sir peter parker attacked the fort on that island with two fifty gun ships the bristol and experiment four frigates the active acteon solebay and syron each of    guns the sphynx of  0 guns the friendship armed vessel of    guns ranger sloop and thunder bomb each of   guns on the fort were mounted    cannon       and   pounders the attack commenced between ten and eleven in the forenoon and was continued for upwards of ten hours the garrison consisting of     regulars and a few militia under the command of colonel moultrie made a most gallant defence they fired deliberately for the most part took     aim and seldom missed their object       the ships were torn almost to pieces and the killed and wounded on board exceeded  00 men the loss of the garrison was only ten men killed and    wounded the fort being built of palmetto was little damaged the shot which struck it were ineffectually buried in its soft wood general clinton had some time before the engagement landed with a number of troops on longisland and     it was expected that he would have cooperated with sir peter parker by crossing over the narrow passage which divides the two islands and attacking the fort in its unfinished rear but the extreme danger to which he must unavoidably have exposed his men induced him to decline the perilous attempt colonel thomson with   or  00 men was stationed at the east end of sullivans island to oppose their crossing no serious attempt was made to land either from the fleet or the detachment commanded by sir henry clinton the firing ceased in the evening and soon after the ships slipped their cables before morning they had retired about two miles from the island within a few days more the troops reembarked and the whole sailed from newyork the thanks of congress were given to general lee who had been sent on by congress to take the command in carolina and also to colonels moultrie and thomson for their good conduct on this memorable day in compliment to the commanding officer the fort from that time was called fort moultrie during the engagement the inhabitants stood with arms in their hands at their respective posts prepared to receive the enemy wherever they might land impressed with high ideas of british power and bravery they were apprehensive that the fort would be either silenced or passed and that they should be called to immediate action they were cantoned in the various landing places near charleston and their resolution was fixed to meet the invaders at the waters edge and dispute every inch of ground trusting the event to heaven by the repulse of this armament the southern states obtained a respite from the calamities of war for two years and a half       the defeat the british met with at charleston   0 seemed in some measure to counterbalance the unfavourable impression made by their subsequent successes to the northward throughout the whole summer and till the close of the year congress had little else than the victory on sullivans island to console them under the various evacuations retreats and defeats to which as shall hereafter be related their armies were obliged to submit in every other part of the union the event of the expedition contributed greatly to establish the cause which it was intended to overset in opposition to the bold assertions of some and the desponding fears of others experience     proved that america might effectually resist a british fleet and army those who from interested motives had abetted the royal government ashamed of their opposition to the struggles of an infant people for their dearest rights retired into obscurity the effects of this victory in animating the americans were much greater than could be warranted by the circumstances of the action as it was the first attack made by the british navy its unsuccessful issue inspired a confidence which a more exact knowledge of military calculations would have corrected the circumstance of its happening in the early part of the war and in one of the weaker provinces were happily instrumental in dispelling the gloom which overshadowed the minds of many of the colonists on hearing of the powerful fleets and numerous armies which were coming against them the command of the force which was designed to operate against newyork in this campaign was given to admiral lord howe and his brother sir william officers who as well from their personal characters as the known bravery of their family stood high in the confidence of the british nation to this service was allotted a very powerful army consisting of about  0000 men this force was far superior to any thing that america had heretofore seen the troops were amply provided with artillery military stores and warlike materials of every kind and were supported by a numerous fleet the admiral and general in addition to their military powers were appointed commissioners for restoring peace to the colonies           general howe having in vain waited two months at halifax for his brother and the expected reinforcements from england impatient of farther delays sailed from that harbour with the force which he had previously commanded in boston jun  0  and directing his course towards newyork arrived in the latter end of june off sandyhook admiral lord howe with part of the reinforcement from england arrived at halifax soon after his brothers departure jun     without dropping anchor he followed and soon after joined him near statenisland the british general on his approach found every part of newyork island and the most exposed parts of longisland fortified and well defended by artillery about fifty british transports anchored near statenisland which had not been so much the object of attention the inhabitants thereof either from fear policy or     affection expressed great joy on the arrival of the royal forces general howe was there met by tryon late governor of the province and by several of the loyalists who had taken refuge with him in an armed vessel he was also joined by about sixty persons from newjersey and  00 of the inhabitants of statenisland were embodied as a royal militia from these appearances great hopes were indulged that as soon as the army was in a condition to penetrate into the country and protect the loyalists such numbers would flock to their standard as would facilitate the attainment of the objects of the campaign on the fourth day after the british transports appeared off sandyhook congress though fully informed of the numbers and appointment of the force about to be employed against the colonies ratified their famous declaration of independence this was publicly read to the american army and received by them with unfeigned acclamations of joy though it was well known that greatbritain had employed a force of   000 men to war upon the newformed states and that the continental army was not near equal to half that number and only engaged for a few months and that congress was without any assurance of foreign aid yet both the american     officers and privates gave every evidence       of their hearty approbation of the decree which severed the colonies from greatbritain and submitted to the decision of the sword whether they should be free states or conquered provinces now said they we know the ground on which we stand now we are a nation no more shall the opprobrious term of rebel with any appearance of justice be applied to us should the fortune of war throw us into the hands of our enemies we may expect the treatment of prisoners and not the punishment of rebels the prize for which we contend is of such magnitude that we may freely risque our lives to obtain it it had early occurred to general washington that the possession of newyork would be with the british a favourite object its central situation and contiguity to the ocean enabled them to carry with facility the war to any part of the sea coast the possession of it was rendered still more valuable by the ease with which it could be maintained surrounded on all sides by water it was defensible by a small number of british ships against adversaries whose whole     navy consisted only of a few frigates hudsons river being navigable for ships of the largest size to a great distance afforded an opportunity of severing the eastern from the more southern states and of preventing almost any communication between them from these well known advantages it was presumed by the americans that the british would make great exertions to effect the reduction of newyork general lee while the british were yet in possession of the capital of massachusetts had been detached from cambridge to put longisland and newyork into a posture of defence as the departure of the british from boston became more certain the probability of their instantly going to newyork increased the necessity of collecting a force for its safety march     it had been therefore agreed in a council of war that five regiments together with a rifle battalion should march without delay to newyork and that the states of newyork and newjersey should be requested to furnish the former two thousand and the     latter one thousand men for its immediate defence       general washington soon followed and early in april fixed his head quarters in that city a new distribution of the american army took place part was left in massachusetts between two and three thousand were ordered to canada but the greater part rendezvoused at newyork experience had taught the americans the difficulty of attacking an army after it had effected a lodgment they therefore made strenuous exertions to prevent the british from enjoying the advantages in newyork which had resulted from their having been permitted to land and fortify themselves in boston the sudden commencement of hostilities in massachusetts together with the previous undisturbed landing of the royal army allowed no time for deliberating on a system of war a change of circumstances indicated the propriety of fixing on a plan for conducting the defence of the new formed states on this occasion general washington after much thought determined on a war of posts this mode of conducting military operations gave confidence to the americans and besides it both retarded and alarmed their adversaries the soldiers in the american army were new levies and had not yet learned to stand uncovered before the instruments of death habituating them to the sound of fire arms while they were sheltered from danger was one     step towards inspiring them with a portion of mechanical courage the british remembered bunkershill and had no small reverence for even slight fortifications when defended by freemen from views of this kind works were erected in and about newyork on long island and the heights of haerlem these besides batteries were field redoubts formed of earth with a parapet and ditch the former were sometimes fraised and the latter palisadoed but they were in no instance formed to sustain a siege slight as they were the campaign was nearly wasted away before they were so far reduced as to permit the royal army to penetrate into the country           the war having taken a more important turn than in the preceding year had been foreseen congress at the opening of the campaign found themselves distitute of a force sufficient for their defence they therefore in june determined on a plan to reinforce their continental army by bringing into the field a new species of troops that would be more permanent than the common militia and yet more easily raised than regulars with this view they instituted a flying camp to consist of an intermediate corps between regular soldiers and militia june    ten thousand men were called for from the states of pennsylvania maryland and delaware to be in constant service to the first day of the ensuing december congress at the same time called for    00 of the common militia from massachusetts connecticut newyork and newjersey the men for forming the flying camp were generally procured but there were great deficiencies of the militia and many of those who obeyed their countrys call so far as to turn out manifested a reluctance to submit to the necessary discipline of camps the difficulty of providing the troops with arms while before boston was exceeded by the superior difficulty of supplying them in their new position by the returns of the garrison at fort montgomery in the highlands in april it appeared that there were  0  privates and only forty one guns fit for use in the garrison at fort constitution there were     men and only    guns fit for use flints were also much wanted lead would have been equally deficient had not a supply for the musquetry been obtained by stripping dwelling houses the uncertainty of the place where the british would commence     their operations added much to the imbarrassment of general washington not only each colony but each seaport town supposed itself to be the object of the british and was ardent in its supplications to the commander in chief for his puculiar attention the people of massachusetts were strongly impressed with an idea that the evacuation of boston was only a feint and that the british army would soon return       they were for that reason very desirous that the continental troops should not be withdrawn     from their state the inhabitants of rhodeisland urged in a long petition that their maritime situation exposed them to uncommon danger while their great exertions in fitting out armed vessels had deprived them of many of their citizens they therefore prayed for a body of continental soldiers to be stationed for their constant and peculiar defence so various were the applications for troops so numerous the calls for arms that a decided conduct became necessary to prevent the feeble american force and the deficient stock of public arms from being divided and subdivided so as to be unequal to the proper defence of any one place in this crisis of particular danger the people of newyork acted with spirit though they knew they were to receive the first impression of the british army yet their convention resolved that all persons residing within the state of newyork and claiming protection from its laws owed it allegiance and that any person owing it allegiance and levying war against the state or being an adherent to the king of greatbritain should be deemed guilty of treason and suffer death they also resolved that one fourth of the militia of westchester dutchess and orange counties should be forthwith drawn out for the defence of the liberties property wives and children of the good people of the state to be continued in service till the last day of december and that as the inhabitants of kings county had determined not to oppose the enemy a committee should be appointed to enquire into the authenticity of these reports and to disarm and secure the disaffected to remove or destroy the stock of grain and if necessary to lay the whole country waste the two royal commissioners admiral and general howe thought proper before they commenced their military operations to try what might be done in their civil capacity towards effecting a reunion     between greatbritain and the colonies it was one of the first acts of lord howe to send on shore a circular letter to several of the royal governors in america informing them of the late act of parliament       for restoring peace to the colonies     and granting pardon to such as should deserve mercy and desiring them to publish a declaration which accompanied the same in this he informed the colonists of the power with which his brother and he were intrusted of granting general or particular pardons to all those who though they had deviated from their allegiance were willing to return to their duty and of declaring any colony province county or town port district or place to be at the peace of his majesty congress impressed with a belief that the proposals of the commissioners instead of disuniting the people would have a contrary effect ordered them to be speedily published in the several american newspapers had a redress of grievances been at this late hour offered though the honour of the states was involved in supporting their late declaration of independence yet the love of peace and the bias of great numbers to their parent state would in all probability have made a powerful party for rescinding the act of separation and for reuniting with greatbritain but when it appeared that the power of the royal commissioners was little more than to grant pardons congress appealed to the good sense of the people for the necessity of adhering to the act of independence the resolution for publishing the circular letter and the declaration of the royal commissioners assigned as a reason thereof that the good people of the united states may be informed of what nature are the commissioners and what the terms with expectation of which the insidious court of greatbritain had endeavoured to amuse and disarm them and that the few who still remain suspended by a hope founded either in the justice or moderation of their late king may now at length be convinced that the valour alone of their country is to save its liberties about the same time flags were sent ashore by lord howe with a letter directed to george washington esq which he refused to receive as not being addressed to him with the title due to his rank       in his letter to congress on this subject he wrote as follows i would     not on any occasion sacrifice essentials to punctilio but in this instance i deemed it a duty to my country and appointment to insist     on that respect which in any other than a public view i would willingly have waved congress applauded his conduct in a public resolution and at the same time directed that no letter or message should be received on any occasion whatever from the enemy by the commander in chief or others the commanders of the american army but such as were directed to them in the characters they severally sustained some time after adjutant general patterson was sent to newyork by general howe with a letter addressed to george washington c c c on an interview the adjutant general after expressing his high esteem for the person and character of the american general and declaring that it was not intended to derogate from the respect due to his rank expressed his hopes that the et ceteras would remove the impediments to their correspondence general washington replied that a letter directed to any person in a public character should have some description of it otherwise it would appear a mere private letter that it was true the et ceteras implied every thing but they also implied any thing and that he should therefore decline the receiving any letter directed to him as a private person when it related to his public station a long conference ensued in which the adjutant general observed that the commissioners were armed with great powers and would be very happy in effecting an accommodation he received for answer that from what appeared their powers were only to grant pardon that they who had committed no fault wanted no pardon soon after this interview a letter from howe respecting prisoners which was properly addressed to washington was received while the british by their manifestoes and declarations were endeavouring to separate those who preferred a reconciliation with greatbritain from those who were the friends of independence congress by a similiar policy was attempting to detach the foreigners who had come with the royal troops from the service of his britannic majesty before hostilities had commenced the following resolution was adopted and circulated among those     on whom it was intended to operate   0 august    resolved that these states will receive all such foreigners who shall leave the armies of his britannic majesty in america and shall chuse to become members of any of these states and they shall be protected in the free exercise of their respective religions and be invested with the rights privileges and immunities of natives as established by the laws of these states and moreover that this congress will provide for every such person fifty acres of unappropriated lands in some of these states to be held by him and his heirs as absolute property the numbers which were prepared to oppose the british when they should disembark made them for some time cautious of proceeding to their projected land operations but the superiority of their navy enabled them to go by water whithersoever they pleased july    a british forty gun ship with some smaller vessels sailed up northriver without receiving any damage of consequence though fired upon from the batteries of newyork pauleshook redbank and governors island an attempt was made not long after with two fire ships to destroy the british vessels in the northriver but without effecting any thing more than the burning of a tender they were also attacked with row gallies but to little purpose after some time the phoenix and rose men of war came down the river and joined the fleet every effort of the americans from their batteries on land as well as their exertions on the water proved ineffectual the british ships passed with less loss than was generally expected but nevertheless the damage they received was such as deterred them from frequently repeating the experiment in two or three instances they ascended the northriver and in one or two the eastriver but those which sailed up the former speedily returned and by their return a free communication was opened through the upper part of the state the american army in and near newyork amounted to       men these were mostly new troops and were divided in many small and unconnected posts some of which were fifteen miles removed from others       the     british force before newyork was increasing by frequent successive arrivals from halifax southcarolina florida the westindies and europe but so many unforeseen delays had taken place that the month of august was far advanced before they were in a condition to open the campaign     when all things were ready the british commanders resolved to make their first attempt on longisland this was preferred to newyork as it abounded with those supplies which their forces required the british landed without opposition between two small towns utrecht and gravesend the american works protected a small peninsula having wallaboutbay to the left and stretching over to redhook on the right and the eastriver being in their rear general sullivan with a strong force was encamped within these works at brooklyne from the eastside of the narrows runs a ridge of hills covered with thick wood about five or six miles in length which terminates near jamaica there were three passes through these hills one near the narrows a second on the flatbush road and a third on the bedford road and they are all defensible these were the only roads which could be passed from the southside of the hills to the american lines except a road which led round the easterly end of the hills to jamaica the americans had  00 men on each of these roads and colonel miles was placed with his battalion of riflemen to guard the road from the south of the hills to jamaica and to watch the motions of the british august    general de heister with his hessians took post at flatbush in the evening in the following night the greater part of the british army commanded by general clinton marched to gain the road leading round the easterly end of the hills to jamaica and to turn the left of the americans he arrived about two hours before day within half a mile of this road one of his parties fell in with a patrol of american officers and took them all prisoners which prevented the early transmission of intelligence       upon the first appearance of day general clinton advanced and took possession of the heights over  00 which the road passed general grant with the left wing advanced along the coast by the west road near the narrows but this was intended chiefly as a feint the guard which was stationed at this road fled without making any resistance a few of them were afterwards rallied and lord stirling advanced with   00 men and took possession of a hill about two miles from the american camp and in front of general grant aug    an attack was made very early in the morning by the hessians from flatbush under general de heister and by general grant on     the coast and was well supported for a considerable time by both sides the americans who opposed general de heister were first informed of the approach of general clinton who had come round on their left they immediately began to retreat to their camp but were intercepted by the right wing under general clinton who got into the rear of their left and attacked them with his light infantry and dragoons while returning to their lines they were driven back till they were met by the hessians they were thus alternately chased and intercepted between general de heister and general clinton some of their regiments nevertheless found their way to the camp the americans under lord stirling consisting of colonel miles two battalions colonel atlees colonel smallwoods and colonel hatches regiments who were engaged with general grant fought with great resolution for about six hours they were uninformed of the movements made by general clinton till some of the troops under his command had traversed the whole extent of country in their rear their retreat was thus intercepted but several notwithstanding broke through and got into the woods many threw themselves into the marsh some were drowned and others perished in the mud but a considerable number escaped by this way to their lines the kings troops displayed great valour throughout the whole day the variety of the ground occasioned a succession of small engagements pursuits and slaughter which lasted for many hours       british discipline in every instance triumphed over the native valour of raw troops  0  who had never been in action and whose officers were unacquainted with the stratagems of war the loss of the british and hessians was about   0 the killed wounded and prisoners of the americans including those who were drowned or perished in the woods or mud considerably exceeded a thousand among the prisoners of the latter were two of their general officers sullivan and lord stirling three colonels   lieutenant colonels   majors    captains    lieutenants and    ensigns smallwoods regiment the officers of which were young men of the best families in the state of maryland sustained a loss of     men the british after their victory were so impetuous that it was with difficulty they could be restrained from attacking the american lines     in the time of and subsequent to the engagement general washington drew over to longisland the greatest part of his army after he had collected his principal force there it was his wish and hope that sir william howe would attempt to storm the works on the island these though insufficient to stand a regular siege were strong enough to resist a coup de main the rememberance of bunkershill and a desire to spare his men restrained the british general from making an assault on the contrary he made demonstrations of proceeding by siege and broke ground within three hundred yards to the left at putnams redoubt aug  0  though general washington wished for an assault yet being certain that his works would be untenable when the british batteries should be fully opened he called a council of war to consult on the measures proper to be taken it was then determined that the objects in view were in no degree proportioned to the dangers to which by a continuation on the island they would be exposed conformably to this opinion dispositions were made for an immediate retreat this commenced soon after it was dark from two points the upper and lower ferries on east river general mdougal regulated the embarkation at one and colonel knox at the other       the intention of evacuating the island had been so prudently concealed  0  from the americans that they knew not whither they were going but supposed to attack the enemy the field artillery tents baggage and about  000 men were conveyed to the city of newyork over east river more than a mile wide in less than    hours and without the knowledge of the british though not six hundred yards distant providence in a remarkable manner favoured the retreating army for some time after the americans began to cross the state of the tide and a strong northeast wind made it impossible for them to make use of their sail boats and their whole number of row boats was insufficient for completing the business in the course of the night but about eleven oclock the wind died away and soon after sprung up at southeast and blew fresh which rendered the sail boats of use and at the same time made the passage from the island to the city direct easy and expeditious towards morning an extreme thick fog came up which hovered over longisland and by concealing the americans enabled them to complete their retreat without interruption though the day     had begun to dawn some time before it was finished by a mistake in the transmission of orders the american lines were evacuated for about three quarters of an hour before the last embarkation took place but the british though so near that their working parties could be distinctly heard being enveloped in the fog knew nothing of the matter the lines were repossessed and held till six oclock in the morning when every thing except some heavy cannon was removed general mifflin who commanded the rear guard left the lines and under the cover of the fog got off safe in about half an hour the fog cleared away and the british entered the works which had been just relinquished had the wind not shifted the half of the american army could not have crossed and even as it was if the fog had not concealed their rear it must have been discovered and could hardly have escaped general sullivan who was taken prisoner on longisland was immediately sent on parole with the following verbal message from lord howe to congress      that though he could not at present treat  0  with them in that character yet he was very desirous of having a conference with some of the members whom he would consider as private gentlemen that he with his brother the general had full powers to compromise the dispute between greatbritain and america upon terms advantageous to both—that he wished a compact might be settled at a time when no decisive blow was struck and neither party could say it was compelled to enter into such agreement that were they disposed to treat many things which they had not yet asked might and ought to be granted and that if upon conference they found any probable ground of accommodation the authority of congress would be afterwards acknowledged to render the treaty complete three days after this message was received general sullivan was requested to inform lord howe that congress being the representatives of the free and independent states of america they cannot with propriety send any of their members to confer with his lordship in their private characters but that ever desirous of establishing peace on reasonable terms they will send a committee of their body to know whether he has any authority to treat with persons authorised by congress for that purpose on behalf of     america and what that authority is and to hear such propositions as he shall think fit to make respecting the same they elected dr franklin john adams and edward rutledge their committee for this purpose in a few days they met lord howe on statenisland and were received with great politeness on their return they made a report of their conference which they summed up by saying it did not appear to your committee that his lordships commission contained any other authority than that expressed in the act of parliament—namely that of granting pardons with such exceptions as the commissioners shall think proper to make and of declaring america or any part of it to be in the kings peace on submission for as to the power of enquiring into the state of america which his lordship mentioned to us and of conferring and consulting with any persons the commissioners might think proper       and representing the result  0  of such conversation to the ministry who provided the colonies would subject themselves might after all or might not at their pleasure make any alterations in the former instructions to governors or propose in parliament any amendment of the acts complained of we apprehended any expectation from the effect of such a power would have been too uncertain and precarious to be relied on by america had she still continued in her state of dependence lord howe had ended the conference on his part by expressing his regard for america and the extreme pain he would suffer in being obliged to distress those whom he so much regarded dr franklin thanked him for his regards and assured him that the americans would shew their gratitude by endeavouring to lessen as much as possible all pain he might feel on their account by exerting their utmost abilities in taking good care of themselves the committee in every respect maintained the dignity of congress their conduct and sentiments were such as became their character the friends to independence rejoiced that nothing resulted from this interview that might disunite the people congress trusting to the good sense of their countrymen ordered the whole to be printed for their information all the states would have then rejoiced at less beneficial terms than they obtained about seven years later but     greatbritain counted on the certainty of their absolute conquest or unconditional submission her offers therefore comported so little with the feelings of america that they neither caused demur nor disunion among the new formed states the unsuccessful termination of the action on the   th led to consequences more seriously alarming to the americans than the loss of their men their army was universally dispirited the militia ran off by companies their example infected the regular regiments the loose footing on which the militia came to camp made it hazardous to exercise over them that discipline without which an army is a mob to restrain one part of an army while another claimed and exercised the right of doing as they pleased was no less impracticable than absurd  0        a council of war recommended to act on the defensive and not to risque the army for the sake of newyork sept    to retreat subjected the commander in chief to reflections painful to bear and yet impolitic to refute to stand his ground and by suffering himself to be surrounded to hazard the fate of america on one decisive engagement was contrary to every rational plan of defending the wide extended states committed to his care a middle line between abandoning and defending was therefore for a short time adopted the public stores were moved to dobbs ferry about    miles from newyork   000 men were ordered to the northern extremity of newyork island and   00 to remain for the defence of the city while the remainder occupied the intermediate space with orders either to support the city or kingsbridge as exigencies might require before the british landed it was impossible to tell what place would be first attacked this made it necessary to erect works for the defence of a variety of places as well as of newyork though every thing was abandoned when the crisis came that either the city must be relinquished or the army risqued for its defence yet from the delays occasioned by the redoubts and other works which had been erected on the idea of making the defence of the states a war of posts a whole campaign was lost to the british and saved to the americans the year began with hopes that greatbritain would recede from her demands and therefore every plan of defence was on a temporary system the declaration of independence which the     violence of greatbritain forced the colonies to adopt in july though neither foreseen nor intended at the commencement of the year pointed out the necessity of organising an army on new terms correspondent to the enlarged objects for which they had resolved to contend sep     congress accordingly determined to raise    battalions to serve during the war under these circumstances to wear away the campaign with as little misfortune as possible and thereby to gain time for raising a permanent army against the next year was to the americans a matter of the last importance       though the commander in chief abandoned those works  0  which had engrossed much time and attention yet the advantage resulting from the delays they occasioned far overbalanced the expence incurred by their erection the same shortsighted politicians who had before censured general washington for his cautious conduct in not storming the british lines at boston renewed their clamors against him for adopting this evacuating and retreating system supported by a consciousness of his own integrity and by a full conviction that these measures were best calculated for securing the independence of america he for the good of his country voluntarily subjected his fame to be overshadowed by a temporary cloud sep    general howe having prepared every thing for a descent on newyork island began to land his men under cover of ships of war between keppsbay and turtle bay a breast work had been erected in the vicinity and a party stationed in it to oppose the british in case of their attempting to land but on the first appearance of danger they ran off in confusion the commander in chief came up and in vain attempted to rally them though the british in sight did not exceed sixty he could not either by example intreaty or authority prevail on a superior force to stand their ground and face that inconsiderable number such dastardly conduct raised a tempest in the usually tranquil mind of general washington having embarked in the american cause from the purest principles he viewed with infinite concern this shameful behaviour as threatening ruin to his country he recollected the many declarations of congress of the army and of the inhabitants preferring liberty to life and death to dishonour and contrasted them with their present scandalous flight     his soul was harrowed up with apprehensions that his country would be conquered—her army disgraced and her liberties destroyed he anticipated in imagination that the americans would appear to posterity in the light of high sounding boasters who blustered when danger was at a distance but shrunk at the shadow of opposition extensive confiscations and numerous attainders presented themselves in full view to his agitated mind       he saw in imagination new formed states with  0  the means of defence in their hands and the glorious prospects of liberty before them levelled to the dust and such constitutions imposed on them as were likely to crush the vigour of the human mind while the unsuccessful issue of the present struggle would for ages to come deter posterity from the bold design of asserting their rights impressed with these ideas he hazarded his person for some considerable time in rear of his own men and in front of the enemy with his horses head towards the latter as if in expectation that by an honourable death he might escape the infamy he dreaded from the dastardly conduct of troops on whom he could place no dependance his aids and the confidential friends around his person by indirect violence compelled him to retire in consequence of their address and importunity a life was saved for public service which otherwise from a sense of honour and a gust of passion seemed to be devoted to almost certain destruction on the day after this shameful flight of part of the american army a skirmish took place between two battalions of light infantry and highlanders commanded by brigadier leslie and some detachments from the american army under the command of lieutenant colonel knowlton of connecticut and major leitch of virginia the colonel was killed and the major badly wounded their men behaved with great bravery and fairly beat their adversaries from the field most of these were the same men who had disgraced themselves the day before by running away struck with a sense of shame for their late misbehaviour they had offered themselves as volunteers and requested the commander in chief to give them an opportunity to retrieve their honour their good conduct at this second engagement proved an antidote to the poison of their example on the preceding day it demonstrated that the americans only wanted resolution and good officers to be on a footing with the british and inspired them     with hopes that a little more experience would enable them to assume not only the name and garb but the spirit and firmness of soldiers the americans having evacuated the city of newyork  0  a brigade of the british army marched into it       they had been but a few days in possession when a dreadful fire most probably occasioned by the disorderly conduct of some british sailors who had been permitted to regale themselves on shore broke out and consumed about a thousand houses dry weather and a brisk wind spread the flames to such an extent that had it not been for great exertions of the troops and sailors the whole city must have shared the same fate after the americans had evacuated newyork they retired to the north end of the island on which that city is erected in about four weeks general howe began to execute a plan for cutting off general washingtons communication with the eastern states and enclosing him so as to compel a general engagement on the island with this view the greater part of the royal army passed through hellgate entered the sound and landed on frogs neck in westchester county oct     two days after they made this movement general lee arrived from his late successful command to the southward oct     he found that there was a prevailing disposition among the officers in the american army for remaining on newyork island oct     a council of war was called in which general lee gave such convincing reasons for quitting it that they resolved immediately to withdraw the bulk of the army he also pressed the expediency of evacuating fort washington but in this he was opposed by general greene who argued that the possession of that post would divert a large body of the enemy from joining their main force and in conjunction with fort lee would be of great use in covering the transportation of provisions and stores up the northriver for the service of the american troops he added farther that the garrison could be brought off at any time by boats from the jersey side of the river his opinion prevailed though the system of evacuating and retreating was in general adopted an exception was made in favour of fort washington and near  000 men were assigned for its defence oct         the royal army after a halt of six days at frogs neck advanced near to newrochelle on their march they  0  sustained a   0 considerable loss by a party of americans whom general lee posted behind a wall oct     after three days general howe moved the right and centre of his army two miles to the northward of new rochelle on the road to the white plains and there he received a large reinforcement general washington while retreating from newyork island was careful to make a front towards the british from eastchester almost to white plains in order to secure the march of those who were behind and to defend the removal of the sick the cannon and stores of his army in this manner his troops made a line of small detached and intrenched camps on the several heights and strong grounds from valentines hill on the right to the vicinity of the white plains on the left oct    the royal army moved in two columns and took a position with the brunx in front upon which the americans assembled their main force at white plains behind entrenchments a general action was hourly expected and a considerable one took place in which several hundreds fell oct     the americans were commanded by general mdougal and the british by general leslie while they were engaged the american baggage was moved off in full view of the british army soon after this general washington changed his front his left wing stood fast and his right fell back to some hills in this position which was an admirable one in a military point of view he both desired and expected an action but general howe declined it and drew off his forces towards dobbs ferry the americans afterwards retired to northcastle general washington with part of his army crossed the northriver and took post in the neighborhood of fortlee a force of about   00 men was left at northcastle under general lee nov    the americans having retired sir william howe determined to improve the opportunity of their absence for the reduction of fort washington this the only post the americans then held on newyork island was under the command of colonel magaw the royal army made four attacks upon it the first on the north   0 side was led on by general kniphausen the second on the east by general mathews supported by lord cornwallis nov     the third was under the direction of lieutenant colonel stirling and the fourth was commanded     by lord piercy the troops under kniphausen when advancing to the fort had to pass through a thick wood which was occupied by colonel rawlings regiment of riflemen and suffered very much from their well directed fire during this attack a body of the british light infantry advanced against a party of the americans who were annoying them from behind rocks and trees and obliged them to disperse lord piercy carried an advance work on his side and lieutenant colonel stirling forced his way up a steep height and took   0 prisoners their outworks being carried the americans left their lines and crouded into the fort colonel rahl who led the right column of kniphausens attack pushed forward and lodged his column within a hundred yards of the fort and was there soon joined by the left column—the garrison surrendered on terms of capitulation by which the men were to be considered as prisoners of war and the officers to keep their baggage and side arms the number of prisoners amounted to   00 the loss of the british inclusive of killed and wounded was about   00 shortly after fort washington had surrendered nov     lord cornwallis with a considerable force passed over to attack fort lee on the opposite jersey shore the garrison was saved by an immediate evacuation but at the expense of their artillery and stores general washington about this time retreated to newark having abundant reason from the posture of affairs to count on the necessity of a farther retreat he asked colonel reed—should we retreat to the back parts of pennsylvania will the pennsylvanians support us the colonel replied if the lower counties are subdued and give up the back counties will do the same the general replied we must retire to augusta county in virginia numbers will be obliged to repair to us for safety and we must try what we can do in carrying on a predatory war and if overpowered we must cross the allegany mountains           while a tide of success was flowing in upon general howe he and his brother as royal commissioners issued a proclamation in which they commanded all persons assembled in arms against his majestys government to disband and all general or provincial congresses to desist from their treasonable actings and to relinquish their usurped power they also declared that every person who within sixty days should appear before the governor lieutenant     governor or commander in chief of any of his majestys colonies or before the general or commanding officer of his majestys forces and claim the benefit of the proclamation and testify his obedience to the laws by subscribing a certain declaration should obtain a full and free pardon of all treasons by him committed and of all forfeitures and penalties for the same many who had been in office and taken an active part in support of the new government accepted of these offers and made their peace by submission some who had been the greatest blusterers in favour of independence veered round to the strongest side men of fortune generally gave way the few who stood firm were mostly to be found in the middle ranks of the people the term of time for which the american soldiers had engaged to serve ended in november or december with no other exception than that of two companies of artillery belonging to the state of newyork which were engaged for the war the army had been organized at the close of the preceding year on the fallacious idea that an accommodation would take place within a twelve month even the flying camp though instituted after the prospect of that event had vanished was enlisted only till the first of december from a presumption that the campaign would terminate by that time when it was expected that the conquerors would retire to winter quarters they commenced a new plan of operations more alarming than all their previous conquests the reduction of fort washington the evacuation of fort lee and the diminution of the american army by the departure of those whose time of service had expired encouraged the british       notwithstanding the     severity of the winter and the badness of the roads to pursue the remaining inconsiderable continental force with the prospect of annihilating it by this turn of affairs the interior country was surprised into confusion and found an enemy within its bowels without a sufficient army to oppose it to retreat was the only expedient left this having commenced lord cornwallis followed and was close in the rear of general washington as he retreated successively to newark to brunswick to princeton to trenton and to the pennsylvania side of the delaware the pursuit was urged with so much rapidity that the rear of the one army pulling down bridges was often within sight and shot off the van of the other building them up     this retreat into and through newjersey was attended with almost every circumstance that could occasion embarrassment and depression of spirits it commenced in a few days after the americans had lost   00 men in fort washington in fourteen days after that event the whole flying camp claimed their discharge this was followed by the almost daily departure of others whose engagements terminated nearly about the same time a farther disappointment happened to general washington at this time gates had been ordered by congress to send two regiments from ticonderoga to reinforce his army two jersey regiments were put under the command of general st clair and forwarded in obedience to this order but the period for which they were enlisted was expired and the moment they entered their own state they went off to a man a few officers without a single private were all that general st clair brought off these two regiments to the aid of the retreating american army the few who remained with general washington were in a most forlorn condition they consisted mostly of the troops which had garrisoned fort lee and had been compelled to abandon that post so suddenly that they commenced their retreat without tents or blankets and without any utensils to dress their provisions in this situation they performed a march of about ninety miles and had the address to prolong it to     the space of nineteen days       as the retreating americans marched through the country scarcely one of the inhabitants joined them while numbers were daily flocking to the royal army to make their peace and obtain protection they saw on the one side a numerous well appointed and full clad army dazzling their eyes with the elegance of uniformity on the other a few poor fellows who from their shabby cloathing were called ragamuffins fleeing for their safety not only the common people changed sides in this gloomy state of public affairs but some of the leading men in newjersey and pennsylvania adopted the same expedient among these mr galloway and the family of the allens of philadelphia were most distinguished the former and one of the latter had been members of congress in this hour of adversity they came within the british lines and surrendered themselves to the conquerors alledging in justification of their conduct that though they had joined with their countrymen in seeking for a redress of     grievances in a constitutional way they had never approved of the measures lately adopted and were in particular at all times averse to independence on the day general washington retreated over the delaware the british took possession of rhodeisland without any loss and at the same time blocked up commodore hopkins squadron and a number of privateers at providence in this period when the american army was relinquishing its general—the people giving up the cause some of their leaders going over to the enemy and the british commanders succeeding in every enterprise general lee was taken prisoner at baskenridge by lieutenant colonel harcourt this caused a depression of spirits among the americans far exceeding any real injury done to their essential interests he had been repeatedly ordered to come forward with his division and join general washington but these orders were not obeyed       this circumstance and the dangerous crisis of public affairs together with his being alone at some distance from the troops which he commanded begat suspicions that he chose to     fall into the hands of the british though these apprehensions were without foundation they produced the same extensive mischief as if they had been realities the americans had reposed extravagant confidence in his military talents and experience of regular european war merely to have lost such an idol of the states at any time would have been distressful but losing him under circumstances which favoured an opinion that despairing of the american cause he chose to be taken a prisoner was to many an extinguishment of every hope by the advance of the british into newjersey the neighbourhood of philadelphia became the seat of war this prevented that undisturbed attention to public business which the deliberations of congress required dec     0  they therefore adjourned themselves to meet in eight days at baltimore resolving at the same time that general washington should be possessed of full powers to order and direct all things relative to the department and the operations of war the activity of the british in the close of the campaign seemed in some measure to compensate for their tardiness in the beginning of it     hitherto they had succeeded in every scheme they marched up and down the jersey side of the river delaware and through the country without any molestation all opposition to the reestablishment of royal government seemed to be on the point of expiring the americans had thus far acted without system or rather feebly executed what had been tardily adopted though the war was changed from its first ground a redress of grievances to a struggle for sovereignty yet some considerable time elapsed before arrangements conformable to this new system were adopted and a much longer before they were carried into execution with the year      a retreating half naked army was to be dismissed and the prospect of a new one was both distant and uncertain the recently assumed independence of the states was apparently on the verge of dissolution it was supposed by many that the record of their existence would have been no more than that      a fickle people impatient of the restraints of regular government     had in a fit of passion abolished that of greatbritain and established in its room free constitutions of their own but these new establishments from want of wisdom in their rulers or of spirit in their people were no sooner formed than annihilated the leading men in their respective governments and the principal members of congress for by this name the insurgents distinguished their supreme council were hanged and their estates confiscated washington the gallant leader of their military establishments—worthy of a better fate—deserted by his army—abandoned by his country—rushing on the thickest battalions of the foe provoked a friendly british bayonet to deliver him from an ignominious death to human wisdom it appeared probable that such a paragraph would have closed some small section in the history of england treating of the american troubles but there is in human affairs an ultimate point of elevation or depression beyond which they neither grow better nor worse but turn back in a contrary course in proportion as difficulties increased congress redoubled their exertions to oppose them dec  0  they addressed the states in animated language calculated to remove their despondency—renew their hopes—and confirm their resolutions     they at the same time dispatched gentlemen of character and influence to excite the militia to take the field general mifflin was on this occasion particularly useful he exerted his great abilities in rousing his fellow citizens by animated and affectionate addresses to turn out in defence of their endangered liberties    congress also recommended to each of the united states to appoint a day of solemn fasting and humiliation to implore of almighty god the forgiveness of their many sins and to beg the countenance and assistance of his providence in the prosecution of the present just and necessary war in the dangerous situation to which every thing dear to the friends of independence was reduced congress transferred extraordinary powers to general washington by a resolution expressed in the following words           the unjust but determined purposes of the british court to enslave these free states obvious through every delusive insinuation to the contrary dec     having placed things in such a situation that the very existence of civil liberty now depends on the right execution of military powers and the vigorous decisive conduct of these being impossible to distant numerous and deliberative bodies this congress having maturely considered the present crisis and having perfect reliance on the wisdom vigour and uprightness of general washington do hereby resolve that general washington shall be and he is hereby vested with full ample and complete powers to raise and collect together in the most speedy and effectual manner from any or all of these united states sixteen battalions of infantry in addition to those already voted by congress to appoint officers for the said battalions of infantry to raise officer and equip  000 lighthorse three regiments of artillery and a corps of engineers and to establish their pay to apply to any of the states for such aid of the militia as he shall judge necessary to form such magazines of provisions and in such places as he shall think proper to displace and appoint all officers under the rank of brigadier general and to fill up all vacancies in every other department in the american armies to take wherever he may be whatever he may want for the use of the army if the inhabitants will not sell it allowing a reasonable price for the same to arrest and confine persons who refuse to take the continental currency or are otherwise disaffected to the american cause and return to the states of which they are citizens     their names and the nature of their offences together with the witnesses to prove them that the foregoing powers be vested in general washington for and during the term of six months from the date hereof unless sooner determined by congress in this hour of extremity the attention of the congress was employed in devising plans to save the states from sinking under the heavy calamities which were bearing them down       it is remarkable that neither in the present condition though trying and severe nor in any other     since the declaration of independence was congress influenced either by force distress artifice or persuasion to entertain the most distant idea of purchasing peace by returning to the condition of british subjects so low were they reduced in the latter end of      that some members distrustful of their ability to resist the power of greatbritain proposed to authorise their commissioners at the court of france whose appointment shall be hereafter explained to transfer to that country the same monopoly of their trade which greatbritain had hitherto enjoyed on examination it was found that concessions of this kind would destroy the force of many arguments heretofore used in favour of independence and probably disunite their citizens it was next proposed to offer a monopoly of certain enumerated articles of produce to this the variant interests of the different states were so directly opposed as to occasion a speedy and decided negative some proposed offering to france a league offensive and defensive in case she would heartily support american independence but this was also rejected the more enlightened members of congress argued though the friendship of small states might be purchased that of france could not they alledged that if she would risque a war with greatbritain by openly espousing their cause it would not be so much from the prospect of direct advantages as from a natural desire to lessen the overgrown power of a dangerous rival it was therefore supposed that the only inducement likely to influence france to an interference was an assurance that the united states were determined to persevere in refusing a return to their former allegiance instead of listening to the terms of the royal commissioners or to any founded on the idea of their resuming their character of british subjects it     was therefore again resolved to abide by their declared independence and proffered freedom of trade to every foreign nation trusting the event to providence and risquing all consequences copies of these resolutions were sent to the principal courts of europe and proper persons were appointed to solicit their friendship to the new formed states       these despatches fell into the hands of the british     and were by them published this was the very thing wished for by congress they well knew that an apprehension of their making up all differences with greatbritain was the principal objection to the interference of foreign courts in what was represented to be no more than a domestic quarrel a resolution adopted in the deepest distress and the worst of times that congress would listen to no terms of reunion with their parent state convinced those who wished for the dismemberment of the british empire that it was sound policy to interfere so far as would prevent the conquest of the united states these judicious determinations in the cabinet were accompanied with vigorous exertions in the field in this crisis of danger   00 of the pennsylvania militia embodied to reinforce the continental army the merchant the farmer the tradesman and the labourer cheerfully relinquished the conveniences of home to perform the duties of private soldiers in the severity of a winter campaign though most of them were accustomed to the habits of a city life they slept in tents barns and sometimes in the open air during the cold months of december and january there were nevertheless only two instances of sickness and only one of death in that large body of men in the course if six weeks the delay so judiciously contrived on the retreat through jersey afforded time for these volunteer reinforcements to join general washington the number of troops under his command at that time fluctuated between two and three thousand men to turn round and face a victorious and numerous foe with this inconsiderable force was risquing much but the urgency of the case required that something should be attempted the recruiting business for the proposed new continental army was at a stand while the british were driving the americans before them the present regular soldiers could as a matter of right in less than a week claim their discharge and scarce a single recruit offered to supply their place under these circumstances the bold resolution     was formed of recrossing into the state of jersey and attacking that part of the enemy which was posted at trenton           when the americans retreated over the delaware the boats in the vicinity were removed out of the way of their pursuers—this arrested their progress but the british commanders in the security of conquest cantoned their army in burlington bordenton trenton and other towns of newjersey in daily expectation of being enabled to cross into pennsylvania by means of ice which is generally formed about that time of all events none seemed to them more improbable than that their late retreating half naked enemies should in this extreme cold season face about and commence offensive operations they indulged themselves in a degree of careless inattention to the possibility of a surprise which in the vicinity of an enemy however contemptible can never be justified it has been said that colonel rahl the commanding officer in trenton being under some apprehension for that frontier post applied to general grant for a reinforcement and that the general returned for answer tell the colonel he is very safe i will undertake to keep the peace in newjersey with a corporals guard in the evening of christmas day general washington made arrangements for recrossing the delaware in three divisions at m konkeys ferry at trenton ferry and at or near bordenton the troops which were to have crossed at the two last places were commanded by generals ewing and cadwallader they made every exertion to get over but the quantity of ice was so great that they could not effect their purpose the main body which was commanded by general washington crossed at m konkeys ferry but the ice in the river retarded their passage so long that it was three oclock in the morning before the artillery could be got over on their landing in jersey they were formed into two divisions commanded by general sullivan and greene who had under their command brigadiers lord stirling mercer and st clair one of these divisions was ordered to proceed on the lower or river road the other on the upper or pennington road col stark with some light troops was also directed to advance near to the river and to possess himself   0 of that part of the town which is beyond the bridge the  00 divisions having nearly the same distance to march were ordered immediately on forcing the out guards to push directly into trenton that they might charge the enemy before they had time to form though they marched different roads yet they arrived at the enemys advanced post within three minutes of each other the out guards of the hessian troops at trenton soon fell back but kept up a constant retreating fire their main body being hard pressed by the americans who had already got possession of half their artillery attempted to file off by a road leading towards princeton but were checked by a body of troops thrown in their way finding they were surrounded they laid down their arms the number which submitted was    officers and     men between  0 and  0 of the hessians were killed and wounded colonel rahl was among the former and seven of his officers among the latter captain washington of the virginia troops and five or six of the americans were wounded two were killed and two or three were frozen to death the detachment in trenton consisted of the regiments of rahl losberg and kniphausen amounting in the whole to about   00 men and a troop of british light horse all these were killed or captured except about  00 who escaped by the road leading to bordenton the british had a strong battalion of light infantry at princeton and a force yet remaining near the delaware superior to the american army general washington therefore in the evening of the same day thought it most prudent to recross into pennsylvania with his prisoners the effects of this successful enterprize were speedily felt in recruiting the american army about   00 regular soldiers whose time of service was on the point of expiring agreed to serve six weeks longer on a promised gratuity of ten paper dollars to each men of influence were sent to different parts of the country to rouse the militia       the rapine and impolitic conduct of the british operated more forcibly on the inhabitants to expel them     the original paging errs skipping over    –   from the state than either patriotism or persuasion to prevent their overrunning it dec    the hessian prisoners taken on the   th being secured general washington recrossed the delaware and took possession of trenton the detachments which had been distributed over newjersey  0  previous to the capture of the hessians immediately after that event assembled at princeton and were joined by the army from brunswick under lord cornwallis       from this position they came forward towards trenton in great force hoping by a vigorous onset to repair the injury their cause had sustained by the late defeat jan  d  truly delicate was the situation of the feeble american army to retreat was to hazard the city of philadelphia and to destroy every ray of hope which had begun to dawn from their late success to risque an action with a superior force in front and a river in rear was dangerous in the extreme to get round the advanced party of the british and by pushing forwards to attack in their rear was deemed preferable to either jan  d  the british on their advance from princeton about   pm attacked a body of americans which were posted with four field pieces a little to the northward of trenton and compelled them to retreat the pursuing british being checked at the bridge over sanpink creek which runs through that town by some field pieces which were posted on the opposite banks of that rivulet fell back so far as to be out of reach of the cannon and kindled their fires the americans were drawn up on the other side of the creek and in that position remained till night cannonading the enemy and receiving their fire in this critical hour two armies on which the success or failure of the american revolution materially depended were crouded into the small village of trenton and only separated by a creek in many places fordable the british believing they had all the advantages they could wish for and that they could use them when they pleased discontinued all further operations and kept themselves in readiness to make the attack next morning sir william erskine is reported to have advised an immediate attack or at least to place a strong     guard at a bridge over sanpink creek which lay in the route the americans took to princeton giving for reason that otherwise washington if a good general would make a move to the left of the royal army and attack the post at princeton in their rear the next morning presented a scene as brilliant on the one side as it was unexpected on the other soon after it became dark gen washington ordered all his baggage to be silently removed and having left guards for the purpose of deception marched with his whole force by a circuitous route to princeton this manoeuvre  0  was determined upon in a council of war from a conviction that it would avoid the appearance of a retreat and at the same time the hazard of an action in a bad position and that it was the most likely way to preserve the city of philadelphia from falling into the hands of the british general washington also presumed that from an eagerness to efface the impressions made by the late capture of hessians at trenton the british commanders had pushed forward their principal force and that of course the remainder in the rear at princeton was not more than equal to his own the event verified this conjecture the more effectually to disguise the departure of the americans from trenton fires were lighted up in front of their camp these not only gave an appearance of going to rest but as flame cannot be seen through concealed from the british what was transacting behind them in this relative position they were a pillar of fire to the one army and a pillar of a cloud to the other providence favoured this movement of the americans the weather had been for some time so warm and moist that the ground was soft and the roads so deep as to be scarcely passable but the wind suddenly changed to the northwest and the ground in a short time was frozen so hard that when the americans took up their line of march they were no more retarded than if they had been upon a solid pavement jan        general washington reached princeton early in the morning and would have completely surprised the british had not a party which was on their way to trenton     descried his troops when they were about two miles distant and sent back couriers to alarm their unsuspecting fellow soldiers in their rear these consisted of the   th the  0th    th regiments of british infantry and some of the royal artillery with two field pieces and three troops of light dragoons the center of the americans consisting of the philadelphia militia while on their line of march was briskly charged by a party of the british and gave way in disorder the moment was critical general washington pushed forward and placed himself between his own men and the british with his horses head fronting the latter the americans encouraged by his example and exhortations made a stand and returned the british fire the general though between both parties was providentially uninjured by either a party of the british fled into the college and were there attacked with field pieces  0  which were fired into it the seat of the muses became for some time the scene of action the party which had taken refuge in the college after receiving a few discharges from the american field pieces came out and surrendered themselves prisoners of war in the course of the engagement sixty of the british were killed and a greater number wounded and about  00 of them were taken prisoners the rest made their escape some by pushing on towards trenton others by returning towards brunswick the americans lost only a few but colonels haslet and potter and capt neal of the artillery were among the slain general mercer received three bayonet wounds of which he died in a short time he was a scotchman by birth but from principle and affection had engaged to support the liberties of his adopted country with a zeal equal to that of any of its native sons in private life he was amiable and his character as an officer stood high in the public esteem while they were fighting in princeton the british in trenton were under arms and on the point of making an assault on the evacuated camp of the americans with so much address had the movement to princeton been conducted that though from the critical situation of the two armies every ear may be supposed to have been     open and every watchfulness to have been employed       yet general washington moved completely off the ground with his whole force stores baggage and artillery unknown to and unsuspected by his adversaries the british in trenton were so entirely deceived that when they heard the report of the artillery at princeton though it was in the depth of winter they supposed it to be thunder that part of the royal army which having escaped from princeton retreated towards newbrunswick was pursued for three or four miles another party which had advanced as far as maidenhead on their way to trenton hearing the frequent discharge of fire arms in their rear wheeled round and marched to the aid of their companions the americans by destroying bridges retarded these though close in their rear so long as to gain time for themselves to move off in good order to pluckemin so great was the consternation of the british at these unexpected movements that they instantly evacuated both trenton and princeton and retreated with their whole force to newbrunswick the  0  american militia collected and forming themselves into parties waylaid their enemies and cut them off whensoever an opportunity presented in a few days they overran the jerseys general maxwell surprised elisabethtown and took near  00 prisoners newark was abandoned and the late conquerors were forced to leave woodbridge the royal troops were confined to amboy and brunswick which held a water communication with newyork thus in the short space of a month that part of jersey which lies between newbrunswick and delaware was both overrun by the british and recovered by the americans the retreat of the continental army the timid policy of the jersey farmers who chose rather to secure their property by submission than defend it by resistance made the british believe their work was done and that little else remained but to reap a harvest of plunder as the reward of their labours       unrestrained by the terrors of civil law uncontrolled by the severity of discipline and elated with their success the soldiers of the royal army and particularly     the hessians gave full scope to the selfish and ferocious passions of human nature a conquered country and submitting inhabitants presented easy plunder equal to their unbounded rapacity infants children old men and women were stripped of their blankets and cloathing furniture was burnt or otherwise destroyed domestic animals were carried off and the people robbed of their necessary household provisions the rapes and brutalities committed on women and even on very young girls would shock the ears of modesty if particularly recited these violences were perpetrated on inhabitants who had remained in their houses and received printed protections signed by order of the commander in chief it was in vain that they produced these protections as a safeguard the hessians could not read them and the british soldiers thought they were entitled to a share of the booty equally with their foreign associates such in all ages has been the complexion of the bulk of armies that immediate and severe punishments are indispensably necessary to keep them from flagrant enormities that discipline without which an army is a band of armed plunderers was as far as respected the inhabitants either neglected or but feebly administered in the royal army the soldiers finding they might take with impunity what they  0  pleased were more strongly urged by avarice than checked by policy or fear had every citizen been secured in his rights protected in his property and paid for his supplies the consequences might have been fatal to the hopes of those who were attached to independence what the warm recommendations of congress and the ardent supplications of general washington could not effect took place of its own accord in consequence of the plundering and devastations of the royal army the whole country became instantly hostile to the invaders sufferers of all parties rose as one man to revenge their personal injuries those who from age or infirmities were incapable of bearing arms kept a strict watch on the movements of the royal army and from time to time communicated information to their countrymen     in arms       those who lately declined all military opposition though called upon by the sacred tie of honour pledged to each other on the declaration of independence chearfully embodied when they found submission to be unavailing for the security of their estates this was not done originally in consequence of the victories of trenton and princeton in the very moment of these actions or before the news of them had circulated sundry individuals unknowing of general washingtons movements were concerting private insurrections to revenge themselves on the plunderers the dispute originated about property or in other words about the right of taxation from the same source at this time it received a new and forcible impulse the farmer who could not trace the consequences of british taxation nor of american independence felt the injuries he sustained from the depredation of licentious troops the militia of newjersey who had hitherto behaved most shamefully from this time forward redeemed their character and throughout a tedious war performed services with a spirit and discipline in many respects equal to that of regular soldiers the victories of trenton and princeton seemed to be like a resurrection from the dead to the desponding friends of independence a melancholy gloom had in the first    days of december overspread the united states but from the memorable era of the   th of same month their prospects began to brighten the recruiting service which for some time had been at a stand was successfully  0  renewed and hopes were soon indulged that the commander in chief would be enabled to take the field in the spring with a permanent regular force general washington retired to morristown that he might afford shelter to his suffering army the american militia had sundry successful skirmishes with detachments of their adversaries within four days after the affair at princeton between forty and fifty waldeckers were killed wounded or taken at springfield by an equal number of the same newjersey militia which but a month before suffered the british to overrun their country     without opposition       this enterprise was conducted by colonel spencer whose gallantry on the occasion was rewarded with the command of a regiment during the winter movements which have been just related the soldiers of both armies underwent great hardships but the americans suffered by far the greater many of them were without shoes though marching over frozen ground which so gashed their naked feet that each step was marked with blood there was scarcely a tent in their whole army the city of philadelphia had been twice laid under contribution to provide them with blankets officers had been appointed to examine every house and after leaving a scanty covering for the family to bring off the rest for the use of the troops in the field but notwithstanding these exertions the quantity procured was far short of decency much less of comfort the officers and soldiers of the american army were about this time inoculated in their cantonment at morristown as very few of them had ever had the small pox the inoculation was nearly universal the disorder had previously spread among them in the natural way and proved mortal to many but after inoculation was introduced though whole regiments were inoculated in a day there was little or no mortality from the small pox and the disorder was so slight that from the beginning to the end of it there was not a single day in which they could not and if called upon would not have turned out and fought the british to induce the inhabitants to accommodate officers and soldiers in their houses while under the small pox they and their families were inoculated gratis by the military surgeons thus in a short time the whole army and the inhabitants in and near morristown were subjected to the small pox and with very little inconvenience to either  0  three months which followed the actions of trenton and princeton passed away without any important military enterprise on either side major general putnam was directed to take post at princeton and cover the country in the vicinity he had only a few hundred troops though he was no more than eighteen miles distant from   0 the strong garrison of the british at brunswick       at one period he had fewer men for duty than he had miles of frontier to guard the situation of general washington at morristown was not more eligible his force was trifling when compared with that of the british but the enemy and his own countrymen believed the contrary their deception was cherished and artfully continued by the specious parade of a considerable army the american officers took their station in positions of difficult access and kept up a constant communication with each other this secured them from insult and surprise while they covered the country they harassed the foraging parties of the british and often attacked them with success of a variety of these the two following are selected as most worthy of notice jan  0  general dickenson with four hundred jersey militia and fifty of the pennsylvania riflemen crossed millstoneriver near somerset courthouse and attacked a large foraging party of the british with so much spirit that they abandoned their convoy and fled nine of them were taken prisoners forty waggons and upwards of one hundred horses with a considerable booty fell into the hands of the general while the british were loading their waggons a single man began to fire on them from the woods he was soon joined by more of his neighbors who could not patiently see their propertys carried away after the foragers had been annoyed for some time by these unseen marksmen they fancied on the appearance of general dickenson that they were attacked by a superior force and began a precipitate flight feb    in about a month after the affair of somerset courthouse colonel nelson of brunswick with a detachment of   0 militiamen surprised and captured at lawrences neck a major and fiftynine privates of the refugees who were in british pay throughout the campaign of      an uncommon degree of sickness raged in the american army husbandmen transferred at once from the conveniences of domestic life to the hardships of a field encampment could not accommodate themselves to the sudden  0  change       the southern troops sickened from the     want of salt provisions linen shirts were too generally worn in contact with the skin the salutary influence of flannel in preventing the diseases of camps was either unknown or disregarded the discipline of the army was too feeble to enforce those regulations which experience has proved to be indispensably necessary for preserving the health of large bodies of men collected together cleanliness was also too much neglected on the  th of august the whole american army before newyork consisted of       men but of that number only  0    were fit for duty these numerous sick suffered much from the want of necessaries hurry and confusion added much to their distresses there was besides a real want of the requisites for their relief a proper hospital establishment was beyond the abilities of congress especially as the previous arrangements were not entered upon till the campaign had begun many perhaps some thousands in the american army were swept off in a few months by sickness the country every where presented the melancholy sight of soldiers suffering poverty and disease without the aid of medicine or attendance those who survived gave such accounts of the sufferings of the sick as greatly discouraged the recruiting service a rage for plundering under the pretence of taking tory property infected many of the common soldiery and even some of the officers the army had been formed on such principles in some of the states that commissions were in several instances bestowed on persons who had no pretensions to the character of gentlemen several of the officers were chosen by their own men and they often preferred those from whom they expected the greatest indulgences in other cases the choice of the men was in favour of those who had consented to throw their pay into a joint stock with the privates from which officers and men drew equal shares the army consisting mostly of new recruits and unexperienced officers and being only engaged for a twelve month was very deficient in that mechanism and discipline which time and experience bestow on veteran troops general washington was unremitting in his     representations to congress favouring such alterations as promised permanency order and discipline in the army but his judicious  0  opinions on these subjects were slowly adopted the sentiments of liberty which then generally prevailed made some distinguished members of congress so distrustful of the future power and probable designs of a permanent domestic army that they had well nigh sacrificed their country to their jealousies the unbounded freedom of the savage who roams the woods must be restrained when he becomes a citizen of orderly government and from the necessity of the case must be much more so when he submits to be a soldier the individuals composing the army of america could not at once pass over from the full enjoyment of civil liberty to the discipline of a camp nor could the leading men in congress for some time be persuaded to adopt energetic establishments god forbid would such say that the citizen should be so far lost in the soldiers of our army that they should give over longing for the enjoyments of domestic happiness let frequent furloughs be granted rather than the endearments of wives and children should cease to allure the individuals of our army from camps to farms  the amiableness of this principle veiled the error of the sentiment the minds of the civil leaders in the councils of america were daily occupied in contemplating the rights of human nature and investigating arguments on the principles of general liberty to justify their own opposition to greatbritain warmed with these ideas they trusted too much to the virtue of their countrymen and were backward to enforce that subordination and order in their army which though it intrenches on civil liberty produces effects in the military line unequaled by the effusions of patriotism or the exertions of undisciplined valor the experience of two campaigns evinced the folly of trusting the defence of the country to militia or to levies raised only for a few months and had induced a resolution for recruiting an army for the war the good effects of this measure will appear in the sequel the campaign of      did not end till it had been     protracted into the first month of the year            the british had counted on the complete and speedy reduction of their late colonies but they found the work more difficult of execution than was supposed they wholly failed in their designs on the southern states in canada they recovered what in the preceding year they had lost—drove the   0 americans out of their borders and destroyed their fleet on the lakes but they failed in making their intended impression on the northwestern frontier of the states they obtained possession of rhodeisland but the acquisition was of little service—perhaps was of detriment for near three years several thousand men stationed thereon for its security were lost to every purpose of active cooperation with the royal forces in the field and the possession of it secured no equivalent advantages the british completely succeeded against the city of newyork and the adjacent country but when they pursued their victories into newjersey and subdivided their army the recoiling americans soon recovered the greatest part of what they had lost sir william howe after having nearly reached philadelphia was confined to limits so narrow that the fee simple of all he commanded would not reimburse the expence incurred by its conquest the war on the part of the americans was but barely begun hitherto they had engaged with temporary forces for a redress of grievances but towards the close of this year they made arrangements for raising a permanent army to contend with greatbritain for the sovereignty of the country to have thus far stood their ground with their new levies was a matter of great importance because of them delay was victory and not to be conquered was to conquer     history of the american revolution  chapter xiii fpage    lpage    chapter xiii of independence state constitutions and the confederation          in former ages it was common for a part of a community to migrate and erect themselves into an independent society since the earth has been more fully peopled and especially since the principles of union have been better understood a different policy has prevailed a fondness for planting colonies has for three preceding centuries given full scope to a disposition for emigration and at the same time the emigrants have been retained in a connexion with their parent state by these means europeans have made the riches both of the east and west subservient to their avarice and ambition though they occupy the smallest portion of the four quarters of the globe they have contrived to subject the other three to their influence or command the circumstances under which newengland was planted would     a few centuries ago have entitled them from their first settlement to the privileges of independence they were virtually exiled from their native country by being denied the rights of men—they set out on their own expence and after purchasing the consent of the native proprietors improved an uncultivated country to which in the eye of reason and philosophy the king of england had no title if it is lawful for individuals to relinquish their native soil and pursue their own happiness in other regions and under other political associations the settlers of newengland were always so far independent as to owe no obedience to their parent state but such as resulted from their voluntary assent the slavish doctrine of the divine right of kings and the corruptions of christianity by undervaluing heathen titles favoured an opposite system what for several centuries after the christian era would have been called the institution of a new government was by modern refinement denominated only an extension of the old in the form of a dependent colony       though the prevailing ecclesiastical and political creeds     tended to degrade the condition of the settlers in newengland yet there was always a party there which believed in their natural right to independence they recurred to first principles and argued that as they received from government nothing more than a charter founded on ideal claims of sovereignty they owed it no other obedience than what was derived from express or implied compact it was not till the present century had more than half elapsed that it occurred to any number of the colonists that they had an interest in being detached from greatbritain their attention was first turned to this subject by the british claim of taxation this opened a melancholy prospect boundless in extent and endless in duration the boston port act and the other acts passed in      and      which have been already the subject of comment progressively weakened the attachment of the colonists to the birth place of their forefathers the commencement of hostilities on the   th of april      exhibited the parent state in an odious point of view and abated the original dread of separating from it but nevertheless at that time and for a twelve month after a majority of the colonists wished for no more than to be reestablished as subjects in their antient rights had independence been their object even at the commencement of     hostilities they would have rescinded these associations which have been already mentioned and imported more largely than ever common sense revolts at the idea that colonists unfurnished with military stores and wanting manufactures of every kind should at the time of their intending a serious struggle for independence by a voluntary agreement deprive themselves of the obvious means of procuring such foreign supplies as their circumstances might make necessary instead of pursuing a line of conduct which might have been dictated by a wish for independence they continued their exports for nearly a year after they ceased to import this not only lessened the debts they owed to greatbritain but furnished additional means for carrying on the war against themselves       to aim at independence and at the same time to transfer their resources to their enemies could not have been     the policy of an enlightened people it was not till some time in      that the colonists began to take other ground and contend that it was for their interest to be forever separated from greatbritain in favour of this opinion it was said that in case of their continuing subjects the mother country though she redressed their present grievances might at pleasure repeat similar oppressions that she ought not to be trusted having twice resumed the exercise of taxation after it had been apparently relinquished the favourers of separation also urged that greatbritain was jealous of their increasing numbers and rising greatness—that she would not exercise government for their benefit but for her own that the only permanent security for american happiness was to deny her the power of interfering with their government or commerce to effect this purpose they were of opinion that it was necessary to cut the knot which connected the two countries by a public renunciation of all political connections between them the americans about this time began to be influenced by new views the military arrangements of the preceding year—their unexpected union and prevailing enthusiasm expanded the minds of their leaders and elevated the sentiments of the great body of their people decisive measures which would have been lately reprobated now met with approbation the favourers of subordination under the former constitution urged the advantages of a supreme head to control the disputes of interfering     colonies and also the benefits which flowed from union that independence was untried ground and should not be entered upon but in the last extremity they flattered themselves that greatbritain was so fully convinced of the determined spirit of america that if the present controversy was compromised she would not at any future period resume an injurious exercise of her supremacy they were therefore for proceeding no farther than to defend themselves in the character of subjects trusting that ere long the present hostile measures would be relinquished       and the harmony     of the two countries reestablished the favourers of this system were embarrassed and all their arguments weakened by the perseverance of greatbritain in her schemes of coercion a probable hope of a speedy repeal of a few acts of parliament would have greatly increased the number of those who were advocates for reconciliation but the certainty of intelligence to the contrary gave additional force to the arguments of the opposite party though new weight was daily thrown into the scale in which the advantages of independence were weighed yet it did not preponderate till about that time in      when intelligence reached the colonists of the act of parliament passed in december      for throwing them out of british protection and of hiring foreign troops to assist in effecting their conquest respecting the first it was said that protection and allegiance were reciprocal and that the refusal of the first was a legal ground of justification for withholding the last they considered themselves to be thereby discharged from their allegiance and that to declare themselves independent was no more than to announce to the world the real political state in which greatbritain had placed them this act proved that the colonists might constitutionally declare themselves independent but the hiring of foreign troops to make war upon them demonstrated the necessity of their doing it immediately they reasoned that if greatbritain called in the aid of strangers to crush them they must seek similar relief for their own preservation but they well knew this could not be expected while they were in arms against their acknowledged sovereign they had therefore only a choice of difficulties and must either seek foreign aid as independent states or continue in the awkward and hazardous situation of subjects     carrying on war from their own resources both against their king and such mercenaries as he chose to employ for their subjugation necessity not choice forced them on the decision submission without obtaining a redress of their grievances was advocated by none who possessed the public confidence       some of the popular leaders may have     secretly wished for independence from the beginning of the controversy but their number was small and their sentiments were not generally known while the public mind was balancing on this eventful subject several writers placed the advantages of independence in various points of view among these thomas paine in a pamphlet under the signature of common sense held the most distinguished rank the stile manner and language of this performance were calculated to interest the passions and to rouse all the active powers of human nature with the view of operating on the sentiments of a religious people scripture was pressed into his service and the powers and even the name of a king was rendered odious in the eyes of the numerous colonists who had read and studied the history of the jews as recorded in the old testament the folly of that people in revolting from a government instituted by heaven itself and the oppressions to which they were subjected in consequence of their lusting after kings to rule over them afforded an excellent handle for prepossessing the colonists in favour of republican institutions and prejudicing them against kingly government hereditary succession was turned into ridicule the absurdity of subjecting a great continent to a small island on the other side of the globe was represented in such striking language as to interest the honor and pride of the colonists in renouncing the government of greatbritain the necessity the advantages and practicability of independence were forcibly demonstrated nothing could be better timed than this performance it was addressed to freemen who had just received convincing proof that greatbritain had thrown them out of her protection had engaged foreign mercenaries to make war upon them and seriously designed to compel their unconditional submission to her unlimited power it found the colonists most thoroughly alarmed for their liberties and disposed to do and suffer any thing that promised their establishment in union with the feelings and sentiments     of the people it produced surprising effects       many thousands were convinced and were led to approve     and long for a separation from the mother country though that measure a few months before was not only foreign from their wishes but the object of their abhorrence the current suddenly became so strong in its favour that it bore down all opposition the multitude was hurried down the stream but some worthy men could not easily reconcile themselves to the idea of an eternal separation from a country to which they had been long bound by the most endearing ties they saw the sword drawn but could not tell when it would be sheathed they feared that the dispersed individuals of the several colonies would not be brought to coalesce under an efficient government and that after much anarchy some future caesar would grasp their liberties and confirm himself in a throne of despotism they doubted the perseverance of their countrymen in effecting their independence and were also apprehensive that in case of success their future condition would be less happy than their past some respectable individuals whose principles were pure but whose souls were not of that firm texture which revolutions require shrunk back from the bold measures proposed by their more adventurous countrymen to submit without an appeal to heaven though secretly wished for by some was not the avowed sentiment of any but to persevere in petitioning and resisting was the system of some misguided honest men the favourers of this opinion were generally wanting in that decision which grasps at great objects and influenced by that timid policy which does its work by halves most of them dreaded the power of britain a few on the score of interest or an expectancy of favours from royal government refused to concur with the general voice some of the natives of the parent state who having lately settled in the colonies had not yet exchanged european for american ideas together with a few others conscientiously opposed the measures of congress but the great bulk of the people and especially of the spirited and independent part of the community came with surprising unanimity into the project of independence   0       the eagerness for independence resulted more from feeling than reasoning the advantages of an unfettered trade the prospect of honours and emoluments in administering a new government     were of themselves insufficient motives for adopting this bold measure but what was wanting from considerations of this kind was made up by the perseverance of greatbritain in her schemes of coercion and conquest the determined resolution of the mother country to subdue the colonists together with the plans she adopted for accomplishing that purpose and their equally determined resolution to appeal to heaven rather than submit made a declaration of independence as necessary in      as was the nonimportation agreement of      or the assumption of arms in      the last naturally resulted from the first the revolution was not forced on the people by ambitious leaders grasping at supreme power but every measure of it was forced on congress by the necessity of the case and the voice of the people the change of the public mind of america respecting connexion with greatbritain is without a parallel in the short space of two years nearly three millions of people passed over from the love and duty of loyal subjects to the hatred and resentment of enemies june   the motion for declaring the colonies free and independent was first made in congress by richard henry lee of virginia he was warranted in making this motion by the particular instructions of his immediate constituents and also by the general voice of the people of all the states when the time for taking the subject under consideration arrived much knowledge ingenuity and eloquence were displayed on both sides of the question the debates were continued for some time and with great animation in these john adams and john dickinson took leading and opposite parts the former began one of his speeches by an invocation of the god of eloquence to assist him in defending the claims and in enforcing the duty of his countrymen he strongly urged the immediate dissolution of all political connexion of the colonies with greatbritain from the voice of the     people       from the necessity of the measure in order to obtain foreign assistance from a regard to consistency and from the prospects of glory and happiness which opened beyond the war to a free and independent people mr dickinson replied to this speech he began by observing that the member from massachusetts mr adams had introduced his defence of the declaration of independence by invoking an heathen god but     that he should begin his objections to it by solemnly invoking the governor of the universe so to influence the minds of the members of congress that if the proposed measure was for the benefit of america nothing which he should say against it might make the least impression he then urged that the present time was improper for the declaration of independence that the war might be conducted with equal vigor without it that it would divide the americans and unite the people of greatbritain against them he then proposed that some assurance should be obtained of assistance from a foreign power before they renounced their connexion with greatbritain and that the declaration of independence should be the condition to be offered for this assistance he likewise stated the disputes that existed between several of the colonies and proposed that some measures for the settlement of them should be determined upon before they lost sight of that tribunal which had hitherto been the umpire of all their differences after a full discussion the measure of declaring the colonies free and independent was approved by nearly an unanimous vote the anniversary of the day on which this great event took place has ever since been consecrated by the americans to religious gratitude and social pleasures it is considered by them as the birth day of their freedom the act of the united colonies for separating themselves from the government of greatbritain and declaring their independence was expressed in the following words      when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands     which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness—that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right     of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its power in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government the history of the present king of greatbritain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world he has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good      he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their     operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the danger of invasion from without and convulsions within he has endeavored to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands   0 he has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers he has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries he has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation           for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighbouring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies for taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments for suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever he has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation he has constrained our fellowcitizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian     savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions      in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned     for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people nor have we been wanting in attention to our british brethren we have warned them from time to time of attempts made by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence they too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity we must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends we therefore the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the name and by authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them and the state of greatbritain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that as free and independent states they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honour john hancock president newhampshire josiah bartlett william

hewes john penn southcarolina edward rutledge thomas heyward jun thomas lynch jun arthur middleton georgia button gwinnett lyman hall george walton from the promulgation of this declaration every thing assumed a new form the americans no longer appeared in the character of subjects in arms against their sovereign but as an independent people repelling the attacks of an invading foe the propositions and supplications for reconciliation were done away the dispute was brought to a single point whether the late british colonies should be conquered provinces or free and independent states the declaration of independence was read publicly in all the states and was welcomed with many demonstrations of joy the people were encouraged by it to bear up under the calamities of war and viewed the evils they suffered only as the thorn that ever accompanies the rose the army received it with particular satisfaction as far as it had validity so far it secured them from suffering as rebels and held out to their view an object the attainment of which would be an adequate recompense       for the     toils and dangers of war they were animated by the consideration that they were no longer to risque their lives for the trifling purpose of procuring a repeal of a few oppressive acts of parliament but for a new organization of government that would forever put it out of the power of greatbritain to oppress them the flattering prospects of an extensive commerce freed from british restrictions and the honours and emoluments of office in independent states now began to glitter before the eyes of the colonists and reconciled them to the difficulties of their situation what was supposed in greatbritain to be their primary object had only a secondary influence while they were charged with aiming at independence from the impulse of avarice and ambition they were ardently wishing for a reconciliation but after they had been compelled to adopt that measure these powerful     principles of human actions opposed its retraction and stimulated to its support that separation which the colonists at first dreaded as an evil they soon gloried in as a national blessing while the rulers of greatbritain urged their people to a vigorous prosecution of the american war on the idea that the colonists were aiming at independence they imposed on them a necessity of adopting that very measure and actually effected its accomplishment by repeatedly charging the americans with aiming at the erection of a new government and by proceeding on that idea to subdue them predictions which were originally false eventually became true when the declaration of independence reached greatbritain the partisans of ministry triumphed in their sagacity the measure said they we have long foreseen is now come to pass they inverted the natural order of things without reflecting that their own policy had forced a revolution contrary to the original design of the colonists the declaration of independence was held out to the people of greatbritain as a justification of those previous violences which were its efficient cause the act of congress for dissevering the colonies from their parent state was the subject of many animadversions           the colonists were said to have been precipitate in adopting a measure from which there was no honourable ground of retreating they replied that for eleven years they had been incessantly petitioning the throne for a redress of their grievances since the year      a continental congress had at three sundry times stated their claims and prayed for their constitutional rights that each assembly of the thirteen colonies had also in its separate capacity concurred in the same measure that from the perseverance of greatbritain in her schemes for their coercion they had no alternative but a mean submission or a vigorous resistance and that as she was about to invade their coasts with a large body of mercenaries they were compelled to declare themselves independent that they might be put into an immediate capacity for soliciting foreign aid the virulence of those who had been in opposition to the claims of the colonists was increased by their bold act in breaking off all subordination to the parent stategreatbritain said they has founded colonies at great expence—has incurred a load of debt by     wars on their account—has protected their commerce and raised them to all the consequence they possess and now in the insolence of adult years rather than pay their proportion of the common expences of government they ungratefully renounce all connexion with the nurse of their youth and the protectress of their riper years the americans acknowledged that much was due to greatbritain for the protection which her navy procured to the coasts and the commerce of the colonies but contended that much was paid by the latter in consequence of the restrictions imposed on their commerce by the former the charge of ingratitude would have been just said they had allegiance been renounced while protection was given but when the navy which formerly secured the commerce and seaport towns of america began to distress the former and to burn the latter the previous obligations to obey or be grateful were no longer in force      that the colonists paid nothing and would not pay to the support of government was confidently asserted and     no credit was given for the sums indirectly levied upon them in consequence of their being confined to the consumption of british manufactures by such illfounded observations were the people of greatbritain inflamed against their fellow subjects in america the latter were represented as an ungrateful people refusing to bear any part of the expences of a protecting government or to pay their proportion of a heavy debt said to be incurred on their account many of the inhabitants of greatbritain deceived in matters of fact considered their american brethren as deserving the severity of military coercion so strongly were the two countries rivetted together that if the whole truth had been known to the people of both their separation would have been scarcely possible any feasible plan by which subjection to greatbritain could have been reconciled with american safety would at any time previous to      have met the approbation of the colonists but while the lust of power and of gain blinded the rulers of greatbritain mistated facts and uncandid representations brought over their people to second the infatuation a few honest men properly authorised might have devised measures of compromise which under the influence of truth humility and moderation would have prevented a dismemberment of the empire but these     virtues ceased to influence and falsehood haughtiness and blind zeal usurped their places had greatbritain even after the declaration of independence adopted the magnanimous resolution of declaring her colonies free and independent states interest would have prompted them to form such a connexion as would have secured to the mother country the advantages of their commerce without the expence or trouble of their governments but misguided politics continued the fatal system of coercion and conquest several on both sides of the atlantic have called the declaration of independence a bold and accidentally a lucky speculation but subsequent events proved that it was a wise measure it is acknowledged that it detatched some timid friends from supporting the americans in their opposition to greatbritain       but it increased the   0 vigour and union of those who possessed more fortitude and perseverance without it the colonists would have had no object adequate to the dangers to which they exposed themselves in continuing to contend with greatbritain if the interference of france was necessary to give success to the resistance of the americans the declaration of independence was also necessary for the french expressly founded the propriety of their treaty with congress on the circumstance that they found the united states in possession of independence all political connexion between greatbritain and her colonies being dissolved the institution of new forms of government became unavoidable the necessity of this was so urgent that congress may     before the declaration of independence had recommended to the respective assemblies and conventions of the united states to adopt such governments as should in their opinion best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents during more than twelve months the colonists had been held together by the force of antient habits and by laws under the simple stile of recommendations the impropriety of proceeding in courts of justice by the authority of a sovereign against whom the colonies were in arms was selfevident the impossibility of governing for any length of time three millions of people by the ties of honour without the authority of law was equally apparent the rejection of british sovereignty therefore drew after it the necessity of fixing on some other principle of government the genius of the americans their republican habits and sentiments     naturally led them to substitute the majesty of the people in lieu of discarded royalty the kingly office was dropped but in most of the subordinate departments of government antient forms and names were retained such a portion of power had at all times been exercised by the people and their representatives that the change of sovereignty was hardly perceptible and the revolution took place without violence or convulsion popular elections elevated private citizens to the same offices which formerly had been conferred by royal appointment       the people felt an uninterrupted continuation of the blessings     of law and government under old names though derived from a new sovereignty and were scarcely sensible of any change in their political constitution the checks and balances which restrained the popular assemblies under the royal government were partly dropped and partly retained by substituting something of the same kind the temper of the people would not permit that any one man however exalted by office or distinguished by abilities should have a negative on the declared sense of a majority of their representatives but the experience of all ages had taught them the danger of lodging all power in one body of men a second branch of legislature consisting of a few select persons under the name of senate or council was therefore constituted in eleven of the thirteen states and their concurrence made necessary to give the validity of law to the acts of a more numerous branch of popular representatives newyork and massachusetts went one step farther the former constituted a council of revision consisting of the governor and the heads of judicial departments on whose objecting to any proposed law a reconsideration became necessary and unless it was confirmed by two thirds of both houses it could have no operation a similar power was given to the governor of massachusetts georgia and pennsylvania were the only states whose legislature consisted of only one branch though many in these states and a majority in all the others saw and acknowledged the propriety of a compounded legislature yet the mode of creating two branches out of a homogeneous mass of people was a matter of difficulty no distinction of ranks existed in the colonies and none were entitled to any rights but such as were common to all some possessed more wealth than others but riches and ability were not always associated ten of the eleven states whose legislatures     consisted of two branches ordained that the members of both should be elected by the people this rather made two coordinate houses of representatives than a check on a single one by the moderation of a select few maryland adopted a singular plan for constituting an independent senate       by her constitution the members of that body     were elected for five years while the members of the house of delegates held their seats only for one the number of senators was only fifteen and they were all elected indiscriminately from the inhabitants of any part of the state excepting that nine of them were to be resident on the west and six on the east side of the chesapeak bay they were elected not immediately by the people but by electors two from each county appointed by the inhabitants for that sole purpose by these regulations the senate of maryland consisted of men of influence integrity and abilities and such as were a real and beneficial check on the hasty proceedings of a more numerous branch of popular representatives the laws of that state were well digested and its interest steadily pursued with a peculiar unity of system while elsewhere it too often happened in the fluctuation of public assemblies and where the legislative department was not sufficiently checked that passion and party predominated over principle and public good pennsylvania instead of a legislative council or senate adopted the expedient of publishing bills after the second reading for the information of the inhabitants this had its advantages and disadvantages it prevented the precipitate adoption of new regulations and gave an opportunity of ascertaining the sense of the people on those laws by which they were to be bound but it carried the spirit of discussion into every comer and disturbed the peace and harmony of neighbourhoods by making the business of government the duty of every man it drew off the attention of many from the steady pursuit of their respective businesses the state of pennsylvania also adopted another institution peculiar to itself under the denomination of a council of censors these were to be chosen once every seven years and were authorised to enquire whether the constitution had been preserved—whether the legislative and executive branch of government had performed their duty or assumed to themselves or exercised other or greater powers than     those to which they were constitutionally entitled       to enquire whether the public taxes had     been justly laid and collected and in what manner the public monies had been disposed of and whether the laws had been duly executed however excellent this institution may appear in theory it is doubtful whether in practice it will answer any valuable end it most certainly opens a door for discord and furnishes abundant matter for periodical altercation either from the disposition of its inhabitants its form of government or some other cause the people of pennsylvania have constantly been in a state of fermentation the end of one public controversy has been the beginning of another from the collision of parties the minds of the citizens were sharpened and their active powers improved but internal harmony has been unknown they who were out of place so narrowly watched those who were in that nothing injurious to the public could be easily effected but from the fluctuation of power and the total want of permanent system nothing great or lasting could with safety be undertaken or prosecuted to effect under all these disadvantages the state flourished and from the industry and ingenuity of its inhabitants acquired an unrivalled ascendancy in arts and manufactures this must in a great measure be ascribed to the influence of habits of order and industry that had long prevailed the americans agreed in appointing a supreme executive head to each state with the title either of governor or president they also agreed in deriving the whole powers of government either mediately or immediately from the people in the eastern states and in new york their governors were elected by the inhabitants in their respective towns or counties and in the other states by the legislatures but in no case was the smallest title of power exercised from hereditary right newyork was the only state which invested its governor with executive authority without a council such was the extreme jealousy of power which pervaded the american states that they did not think proper to trust the man of their choice with the power of executing their own determinations without obliging him in many cases to take the advice of such counsellors as they thought proper to nominate     the disadvantages of this institution far outweighed its advantages had the governors succeeded by hereditary     right a council would have been often necessary to supply the real want of abilities but when an individual had been selected by the people as the fittest person for discharging the duties of this high department to fetter him with a council was either to lessen his capacity of doing good or to furnish him with a skreen for doing evil it destroyed the secrecy vigor and dispatch which the executive power ought to possess and by making governmental acts the acts of a body diminished individual responsibility in some states it greatly enhanced the expences of government and in all retarded its operations without any equivalent advantages newyork in another particular displayed political sagacity superior to her neighbors this was in her council of appointment consisting of one senator from each of her four great election districts authorised to designate proper persons for filling vacancies in the executive departments of government large bodies are far from being the most proper depositaries of the power of appointing to offices the assiduous attention of candidates is too apt to biass the voice of individuals in popular assemblies besides in such appointments the responsibility for the conduct of the officer is in a great measure annihilated the concurrence of a select few on the nomination of one seems a more eligible mode for securing a proper choice than appointments made either by one or by a numerous body in the former case there would be danger of favoritism in the latter that modest unassuming merit would be overlooked in favour of the forward and obsequious a rotation of public officers made a part of most of the american constitutions frequent elections were required by all but several still farther and deprived the electors of the power of continuing the same office in the same hands after a specified length of time young politicians suddenly called from the ordinary walks of life to make laws and institute forms of government turned their attention to the histories of ancient republics     and the writings of speculative men on the subject of government       this led them into many errors and occasioned them to adopt sundry opinions unsuitable to the state of society in america and contrary to the genius of real republicanism the principle of rotation was carried so far that in some of the   0 states public officers in several departments scarcely knew their official duty till they were obliged to retire and give place to others as ignorant as they had been on their first appointment if offices had been instituted for the benefit of the holders the policy of diffusing these benefits would have been proper but instituted as they were for the convenience of the public the end was marred by such frequent changes by confining the objects of choice it diminished the privileges of electors and frequently deprived them of the liberty of choosing the man who from previous experience was of all men the most suitable the favourers of this system of rotation contended for it as likely to prevent a perpetuity of office and power in the same individual or family and as a security against hereditary honours to this it was replied that free fair and frequent elections were the most natural and proper securities for the liberties of the people it produced a more general diffusion of political knowledge but made more smatterers than adepts in the science of government as a farther security for the continuance of republican principles in the american constitutions they agreed in prohibiting all hereditary honours and distinction of ranks it was one of the peculiarities of these new forms of government that all religious establishments were abolished some retained a constitutional distinction between christians and others with respect to eligibility to office but the idea of supporting one denomination at the expence of others or of raising any one sect of protestants to a legal preeminence was universally reprobated the alliance between church and state was completely broken and each was left to support itself independent of the other      the far famed social compact between the people and their rulers did not apply to the united states the     sovereignty was in the people in their sovereign capacity by their representatives they agreed on forms of government for their own security and deputed certain individuals as their agents to serve them in public stations agreeably to constitutions which they prescribed for their conduct the world has not hitherto exhibited so fair an opportunity for promoting social happiness it is hoped for the honor of human nature that the result will prove the fallacy of those theories which suppose that mankind are incapable of self government the ancients     not knowing the doctrine of representation were apt in their public meetings to run into confusion but in america this mode of taking the sense of the people is so well understood and so completely reduced to system that its most populous states are often peaceably convened in an assembly of deputies not too large for orderly deliberation and yet representing the whole in equal proportions these popular branches of legislature are miniature pictures of the community and from the mode of their election are likely to be influenced by the same interests and feelings with the people whom they represent as a farther security for their fidelity they are bound by every law they make for their constituents the assemblage of these circumstances gives as great a security that laws will be made and government administered for the good of the people as can be expected from the imperfection of human institutions in this short view of the formation and establishment of the american constitutions we behold our species in a new situation in no age before and in no other country did man ever possess an election of the kind of government under which he would choose to live the constituent parts of the antient free governments were thrown together by accident the freedom of modern european governments was for the most part obtained by the concessions or liberality of monarchs or military leaders in america alone reason and liberty concurred in the formation of constitutions       it is true from the infancy of political knowledge in the united states there were     many defects in their forms of government but in one thing they were all perfect they left the people in the power of altering and amending them whenever they pleased in this happy peculiarity they placed the science of politics on a footing with the other sciences by opening it to improvements from experience and the discoveries of future ages by means of this power of amending american constitutions the friends of mankind have fondly hoped that oppression will one day be no more and that political evil will at least be prevented or restrained with as much certainty by a proper combination or separation of power as natural evil is lessened or prevented by the application of the knowledge or ingenuity of man to domestic purposes no part of the history of antient or modem europe can furnish a single fact that militates against this     opinion since in none of its governments have the principles of equal representation and checks been applied for the preservation of freedom on these two pivots are suspended the liberties of most of the states where they are wanting there can be no security for liberty where they exist they render any farther security unnecessary the rejection of british sovereignty not only involved a necessity of erecting independent constitutions but of cementing the whole united states by some common bond of union the act of independence did not hold out to the world thirteen sovereign states but a common sovereignty of the whole in their united capacity it therefore became necessary to run the line of distinction between the local legislatures and the assembly of the states in congress a committee was appointed for digesting articles of confederation between the states or united colonies as they were then called at the time the propriety of declaring independence was under debate and some weeks previously to the adoption of that measure but the plan was not for sixteen months after so far digested as to be ready for communication to the states nor was it finally ratified by the accession of all the states till nearly three years more had elapsed       in discussing its articles many difficult questions occurred one was to ascertain the ratio of     contributions from each state two principles presented themselves numbers of people and the value of lands the last was preferred as being the truest barometer of the wealth of nations but from an apprehended impracticability of carrying it into effect it was soon relinquished and recurrence had to the former that the states should be represented in proportion to their importance was contended for by those who had extensive territory but they who were confined to small dimensions replied that the states confederated as individuals in a state of nature and should therefore have equal votes from fear of weakening their exertions against the common enemy the large states for the present yielded the point and consented that each state should have an equal suffrage it was not easy to define the power of the state legislatures so as to prevent a clashing between their jurisdiction and that of the general government on mature deliberation it was thought proper     that the former should be abridged of the power of forming any other confederation or alliance—of laying on any imposts or duties that might interfere with treaties made by congress—or keeping up any vessels of war or granting letters of marque or reprisal the powers of congress were also defined of these the principle were as follows to have the sole and exclusive right of determining on peace and war—of sending and receiving ambassadors—of entering into treaties and alliances—of granting letters of marque and reprisal in times of peace—to be the last resort on appeal in all disputes between two or more states—to have the sole and exclusive right of regulating the alloy and value of coin of fixing the standard of weights and measures—regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the indians—establishing and regulating post offices—to borrow money or emit bills on the credit of the united states—to build and equip a navy—to agree upon the number of land forces and to make requisitions from each state for its quota of men in proportion to the number of its white inhabitants      no coercive power was given to the general government nor was it invested with any legislative power over     individuals but only over states in their corporate capacity as at the time the articles of confederation were proposed for ratification the americans had little or no regular commercial intercourse with foreign nations a power to regulate trade or to raise a revenue from it though both were essential to the welfare of the union made no part of the federal system to remedy this and all other defects a door was left open for introducing farther provisions suited to future circumstances the articles of confederation were proposed at a time when the citizens of america were young in the science of politics and when a commanding sense of duty enforced by the pressure of a common danger precluded the necessity of a power of compulsion the enthusiasm of the day gave such credit and currency to paper emissions as made the raising of supplies an easy matter the system of federal government was therefore more calculated for what men then were under these circumstances than for the languid years of peace when selfishness usurped the place of public spirit and when credit no longer assisted in providing for the exigencies of government     the experience of a few years after the termination of the war proved as will appear in its proper place that a radical change of the whole system was necessary to the
