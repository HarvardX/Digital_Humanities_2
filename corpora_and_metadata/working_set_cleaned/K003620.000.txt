an essay on physic  or an attempt to revive the practice of the ancients  with some general observations on animal mechanism and the materia medica  by andrew hook md  london printed for j roberts

the reader with the occasion of the following essay or make any apology for publishing it the subject of it is too important to need the latter and the former is a matter of no consequence to the public and as i am not in humor at present to compliment either my self or others and have neither leisure nor inclination to be impertinent i shall directly fall on my subject without farther preface or dedication  it is a matter of fact beyond dispute in the history of physic as far as we have any remaining records of it from its first rise to this day that the materia medica has still grown more and more bulky in every age from what causes this arose and what effects it has produced will be farther seen in the course of this essay  the most ancient physicians as far as we can find made use of but very few remedies and those few were entirely directed to the natural evacuations either to promote such as were obstructed and defective or to check and restrain such as were excessive and redundant and herein they exactly followed the direction and indications of nature by observing what augmentation or diminution of these evacuations brought on such and such morbid symptoms and by what ways and means they were removed and carried off when the whole process was left to nature only without any assistance or interposition of art and as this was the only proper foundation to erect a laudable praxis upon so in fact we find that the medical processes of the ancients were always more or less successful as they had a nearer or more remote relation in their intention of cure to the operations of unassisted nature and were directed governed and conducted by this principle  while men thus contented themselves with knowing only what they could discover in fact confined their reasonings to such phenomenon as occurred by observation and experience and were not ashamed to confess their ignorance where they had no true knowledge they studied nature more successfully and applied their knowledge to much better purpose and physic as well as other arts and sciences was considerably advanced and improved but such was the vanity of the philosophers in pretending to search into the real essences intrinsic constitutions and formal causes of things that in this whimsical pursuit they had not only set aside the true method of improving knowledge by careful observation and just experiments but introduced into its room a chimerical succedaneum which had no foundation in reason and nature but was merely fictitious imaginary and hypothetical and thus while they thought to ransack the bowels and penetrate to the very center of nature they lost sight of the surface and could not perceive or judge of what was before their eyes  if these dark and profound inquisitors had confined their enquirys and lucubrations to matters of speculation and entertainment and had not attempted to intrude their whimsys and reveries into common life and the useful arts and sciences though no good had come of it yet on the other hand no great harm would have been done but the mischief lay here that in every age the philosophy most in vogue like a torrent carried all before it broke in upon soul and body at once and settled not only the faith of christians but the practice of physicians too and hence we meet with in their turns platonists aristotelians cartesians corpuscularians specificians and rosicrucians in physic as well as in divinity these all claimed the same implicit faith and obedience to their respective creeds canons and constitutions equally denied the right of private judgment to all their disciples and as far as lay in their power discouraged and opposed all rational freedom of inquiry whatsoever thus a physical as well as theological orthodoxy was ever insisted on and a man in either case was always reputed to die a heretic if he did not die in form  the state of physic thus stood for many ages on the authority of the schools and whimsies of the theorists the study of nature was almost wholly laid aside and the good old way to knowledge by observations and experiments was superseded by canons and aphorisms founded on a mere verbal and unintelligible philosophy which from authority only obtained the name of first principles and of consequence were not to be disputed and hence we find that the practice of physic in every succeeding age became more and more uncertain and precarious till it ran quite out of character and fell into the hands of visionaries and chemical enthusiasts who being for the most part men of strong imaginations and weak judgments employed all their thoughts and spent all their time in search after the alkahest or universal medicine and so eager were they in the pursuit of this chimaera that they not only neglected but almost quite lost the little knowledge they had of particular remedies  and that a proper theory might not be wanting exactly suited to this whimsical and ridiculous enterprise and finding it impracticable to adapt any one then in being or to contrive a new one in the way of reason and nature they wisely took it into their heads to introduce machinery into medicine and to bring in demons and supernatural agents to their assistance thus the archaeus came into play and was constituted superintendant over the whole animal economy this majordomo as long as he was in good humor executed his commission very faithfully and guarded the health and safety of the whole body so that all danger was prevented and every thing went on well but no sooner was he displeased and disobliged but he neglected his guard disease broke in upon the constitution and all was out of order and nothing in nature could restore it again to its former health and rectitude till the archaeus was pacifyed and appeased with the grand secret or universal medicine now this grand secret you must know was a certain chemical preparation so exactly suited to his taste that it never failed when timely administered by the physician to answer this intention but when this peevish testy phantom happened to be neglected too long he then fell into a passion became implacable and in his rage and fury always destroyed the patient  this scheme as whimsical and visionary as it appears to be has had for its patrons and defenders gentlemen of the greatest name and i make no doubt but long ever this time some happy genius or other in the enthusiastic way would have carried this matter if possible into farther fanaticism had not mathematical and mechanical learning which began to be in fashion in the last age put people on a better method of enquiry and a juster way of reasoning  and yet notwithstanding such is the prodigious and almost insuperable force of prejudice and education that a great part of this scheme is still retained by gentlemen who would think themselves ill used if their mathematical or mechanical knowledge should be called in question under the animal spirits notion of to whom they have assigned much the same province and powers as was done to the archaeus before with this additional absurdity that these animal spirits have been treated as mechanical and intelligent agents at the same time of which any one may be convinced who shall think it worth his while to look into and examine the several hypotheses on this subject  and though it must be owned that great advances and improvements have been since made by the moderns in natural knowledge yet it is much to be wished that a better method had been taken in the application of this to the animal economy the practice of physic and the cure of diseases but such has been the hard fate of this profession that amidst all other advances physic has been so very little improved that we have but one book in the world as far as i know wherein any general attempt has been made to apply the true philosophy of nature to the animal economy and the materia medica and this in my opinion has been executed with such success by the ingenious author of the philosophical principles of medicine that the intelligent unprejudiced reader may promise himself to meet therein with almost every thing that is valuable in the theory and practice of physic erected into one consistent system founded on indisputable principles and judiciously drawn out into all its useful corollaries and consequences nay it is a truth but too plain in fact that in general we are much declined from the more simple and natural methods of cure made use of by the ancients and as this has been chiefly owing to our neglecting the true rational indications and intentions of cure so instead of applying to this as nature would direct us we have been and still are continually amused with an infinite jumble of medicines under the notion of specific alteratives as if by a most unaccountable and unintelligible transmutation the morbid matter could be converted into good blood and humors and retained in the body without injury to the constitution and there were no need at all of throwing it off by any of the natural evacuations which idle conceit is without doubt the bane of all rational practice and the common cheat by which quacks empyricks and ignorant pretenders chowse and dupe people out of their money and lives  now in order to show the folly and absurdity of this notion and to contribute what lies in my power toward reviving the more natural and rational practice of the ancients i shall in this essay under distinct sections consider the principal operations of medicines and the manner in which they act end herein i shall confine my self to such simples as are most useful and necessary in practice with due allowance for some choice of things in the same general intention for the better accommodation of them to the stomach and particular liking of the patient avoiding as much as possible all such philosophical speculations as have the least tendency to lead me beside my design or to draw me into any considerations or enquiries concerning them beyond their obvious sensible qualities and effects which in my opinion is the true boundary of all medicinal knowledge and the ne plus ultra of the physicians empire  sect i of animal mechanism it would be impossible to give any rational account of diseases and their cure without a general knowledge of the animal economy and the method of nature in preparing digesting and secreting the several liquors of the glands and the principal ends and uses for which they are intended and as this can only be known by a careful observation of facts and the method of nature either in preserving health or in the formation and cure of diseases where there has been no interposition of art and no reasonings a priori or antecedent to the facts themselves so it is no wonder that the theorists in all ages who deviated from this good old way of the ancients and set out with other views and on other principles bewildered themselves and their followers and never arrived at any one point of real and useful knowledge or made the least advance or improvement in the art of healing  the most ancient physicians who were always the best philosophers of their time grounded their curative intentions upon the most obvious and sensible effects of medicines as they either promoted or restrained this or the other natural evacuation and thereby corrected any such error either in excess or defect and this most obvious and sensible effect visible to all bystanders or observers they called the virtue power or property of the medicine and herein they never expected or promised any sensible effect in the cure of diseases from insensible or unknown causes or which is the same thing they were not let into the mystery of our modern specific or corpusculariau philosophy they did not understand the magic of curing diseases by occult qualities in medicines or of producing sensible effects without sensible causes  but our modern writers upon physic and the cure of diseases have for the most part inverted this order of nature by a most ungeometrical and immechanical application of geometry and mechanism to the animal structure and economy and not a few of the great masters and leaders of the faculty have either made their own data assumed false principles without proofs or reasoned illogically by drawing false consequences from real facts and just principles of this i shall give some very pregnant and convincing instances that i may not be thought to talk at random or to lay in a charge against our modern medicophilosophers without ground or reason for though i love truth yet i hate any thing that looks like malice and defamation and had much rather be convicted of ignorance than dishonesty    then the ancients had observed that the small parts of some sorts of matter would attract and intimately unite or incorporate with each other while the particles of other sort of matter would naturally separate and disunite and could not easily be incorporated at all thus they observed that the particles of salts would readily dissolve in and intimately mix and incorporate with water though they are specifically heavier and that oils and sulphurs would not do so but on the contrary disunite separate and repel each other whatever their different specific gravities might be  they observed likewise in the animal body that the several parts to be supplied and nourished would attract imbibe and retain their proper nutritive matter and repel or drive on any other sort of matter not fit for such a purpose and these different powers or properties in the several sorts of matter which they observed to be so obvious and visible to the senses they called sympathy and antipathy without knowing the causes of it or so much as pretending to reason from it a priori and here therefore they could mean no more by it than we do by centripetal and centrifugal forces or the mutual attraction and repulsion of the several parts of matter the most ancient philosophers and physicians therefore had as clear and distinct ideas of their sympathy and antipathy and understood what they meant by it as well as we do the gravity and vis inertiae of bodies in general the elasticity of the air or the pressure of fluids and the different degrees of attraction in bodies and it is more than probable were these gentlemen now living and asked to explain themselves on this subject that they might tell us they would assign the causes of what they called sympathy and antipathy as soon as we had explained and assigned the causes of any of the other facts and sensible appearances before mentioned and that till we could do this we should in reality be no wiser than they  it must be owned that this doctrine was afterward very much corrupted and abused and applied to a thousand cases where it could have no place as the peripatetick philosophy grew into vogue and came to be more and more celebrated in the schools for in this philosophy words were never intended to signify any real facts appearances or phenomenon in nature but only the unknown causes or internal constitutions of things this indeed was a short way of talking about every thing known or unknown but a roundabout way to knowledge as it never produced any but as this cannot affect the more ancient physicians and philosophers or those who lived after aristotles time who still built their knowledge of nature upon observation experiment and fact as much as if no such philosopher had ever been born so it is certain that no other real improvement of natural knowledge has ever been made or ever can be made on any other plan whatsoever  when the ancients were mistaken it was generally owing to want of clearer facts or data to reason upon but the moderns by wrong reasoning upon facts and drawing false consequences from things given have run into more and grosser errors than had ever been known before in short the most ancient physicians were very good modern philosophers in every thing relating to their profession whatever they might be as to other parts of nature while the generality of the moderns though very good philosophers in other respects are yet with regard to the medical art in spite of all the newtonian principles and discoveries downright atomists or aristotelians  the ancients knew nothing of the circulation of the blood from the heart through the arteries and back again by the returning veins nor of the particular ducts through which part of the chyle is conveyed from the stomach to the subclavian veins but the moderns having made these discoveries let us consider some of the fruits of it and the consequences they have drawn from it  from the circulation of the blood as a fact given it has been commonly concluded that the action of the heart in its alternate systole and diastole is the whole force and adequate power by which the blood is moved in the course of its circulation knowing therefore that the blood circulates and presuming that the heart is the moving force or power this power has been exactly computed at a great expense of geometry and mechanism and herein the gentlemen who have applied themselves to this have succeeded so well and come so near together that they have differed only about the force of the heart in the proportion of  00000 to i for this upon a just computation will be found to be nearly the difference between dr james keil and the famous borelli in his book de motu animalium but in the mean while might it not be as well to be quite ignorant of the circulation of the blood as not to be able to apply it to better purpose did not the ancients bleed when occasion required before they knew any thing at all of the circulation of the blood nay did they not use phlebotomy with more judgment and success by opening a vein as near as possible to the part affected while the moderns have absurdly run into the contrary practice against fact and experience as well as the reason and nature of things by falsely concluding that twould be indifferent from what part of the body blood should be drawn since in consequence of the circulation the aequilibrium of the vital fluid would necessarily be soon restored again or has the knowledge of the circulation by any use or application whatever that has yet been made of it at all improved the art of healing  but farther from the discovery of the chyliferous ducts which terminate chiefly in the left subclavian vein though they are often found in the right too it has been concluded that the whole quantity of chyle and every thing that can be conveyed from the stomach through the lacteals must pass this way into the blood vessels and that this matter must afterward be derived again from the blood in the arteries by the glandular secretory ducts before there can be any such thing as animal nutrition or evacuation but as this is contrary to all the phenomenon of animal nature and demonstratively false in fact it could not possibly have ever entered into the heads of men who had not had the vast advantage of modern discoverys in physic  any man i think who has made the least reflection upon this matter if not too strongly prejudiced or accustomed to another way of thinking must be convinced that the natural evacuations in their increased or diminished quantities do not at all follow the laws and conditions of the sanguineous circulation or the increased or diminished velocity and momentum of the blood but that one may be increased while the other is diminished and produce their effects reciprocally in inflammatory and effluent fevers where the velocity and impetus of the blood is greatest the natural secretions and evacuations are generally greatly diminished and on the contrary in the paroxisms of diabetical hypochondriacal and hysteric disorders we often find a very great and extraordinary profluvium of urine where the circulation of the blood is very low and languid or almost quite suspended which could not possibly happen i think if these evacuations were made from the arterial blood and depended on the velocity and impetus of that fluid  in atrophys we frequently see people running off all their flesh till they are reduced to mere skin and bones and yet the blood vessels remain still full and turgid and the blood upon opening a vein comes off with sufficient force and freedom and there are no symptoms or indications at all of any diminution or defect of that fluid  in a dropsy every thing that is drank or taken in of a fluid nature fills up and distends the ventricles of the glands the lymphatick ducts and membranous cells throughout the body still more and more while the quantity of blood upon the whole is not at all increased but rather much lessened and diminished and bleeding in this case is so far from lessening or abating any such glandular lymphatick or membranous plethora that on the contrary it rather increases strengthens and confirms it and farther in this case such a plethora or redundancy of water may be all drawn off and discharged by urine stools sweating etc without affecting or altering the state of the blood so far as can be discovered either as to its quantity or quality  these facts and observations to mention no more are i think sufficient to demonstrate that there is no such intercourse and communication between the glands and membranous cells and the blood as is commonly imagined and that a defect or redundancy may happen in either independent of each other and consequently that those lacteals which convey a certain portion of the chyle from the stomach to be emptyed into the blood vessels may receive either more or less than their share as well as those which are to carry off and convey the same to the breasts kidneys cutaneous ducts etc and this independent on each other as the recipients leading to one part or the other may either be too lax and open or too much constringed and obstructed and from hence it is that we find some persons and constitutions very much inclined and disposed to collect and accumulate blood while they are still thin and lean in flesh and others to grow fat and fleshy with a scarcity and defect of blood at the same time which yet as plain and evident as it is in fact i think could not possibly happen upon the modern hypothesis of secretion or if the whole quantity of chyle or nutriment from the stomach were to be conveyed and thrown into the blood before any other part could be supplied with the same  another modern discovery in physic as a consequence of the former is this that there is no such thing as different fermentations digestions and separations of liquors in the ventricles of the glands from different degrees of heat and motion but that all the variety of the different secretions is effected by a simple colature from the arterial blood through small pipes of different diameters and which will admit of fluid particles of one size but not of another without any glandular concoction whatsoever now if any body had a mind to look like a mechanician and chemist without being one the bellinian doctrine would soon furnish him with words that might sound very well and a man who is well versed in that hypothesis may possibly be thought a considerable philosopher while he is talking the greatest and most egregious nonsense in the world for though we see every day and in the whole economy and process of nature very great changes and transmutations made upon fluids by fermentation and digestion under different degrees of heat rarefaction and intestine motion yet no man could ever observe any such thing effected by any sort of colature or straining whatsoever and when these gentlemen will be pleased to give us any instances of turning must into wine wort into beer or chyle into milk urine bile etc by straining it will then be time enough to consider this matter farther but in the mean while if they will not be convinced to the contrary themselves i hope they will give me and some others leave to laugh at such an hypothesis at least till they are better able to support it  the ancients though they had not the use of microscopes the method of injecting the vessels and several other helps with which providence has favored us yet they were very careful and diligent observers of all the obvious sensible appearances or phenomenon of nature in the animal structure and economy and from hence they formed judgments and conclusions more certain and successful concerning the formation and cure of diseases than ever the moderns have done from a great number of most precarious and false hypotheses under the pretense of a better application of geometry mechanism and philosophy to physic and the animal economy the pretended fermentations of acids and alkalys in the blood the various combinations of the chemical principles of salt sulphur and mercury in the body and the effects from thence arising the motive power of the animal spirits together with their several suffocations and explosions concentrations and dissipations the specific transmutations of morbid matter and the miraculous power of medicinal corpuscles upon the blood the mysterious effects of straining or the preparation of all the different liquors of the glands by a simple colature from the blood in the arteries these are some of the most prevailing hypotheses which the moderns have assumed and argued upon as facts without the least ground or reason from any of the reast appearances or phenomenon of nature and to which i shall here only add one more as the crown and glory of all the rest namely that the blood in its circulation moves it self by means of the animal spirits which are at the same time moved by the blood for in this hypothesis the blood cannot move till the heart contracts by the influx of the animal spirits from the nerves and on the other hand the animal spirits cannot flow through the nerves into the heart till they have been separated in the brain by the prior motion or circulation of the blood so that herein it is evident that they are both supposed as the antecedent causes and consequent effects of each other and the blood in this way of accounting for its circulation can have no motion but what it communicates to and returns upon it self and this against a constant resistance without any prior independent moving force at all which is just as good sense as if any one should assign the weight spring or moving force applied to the wheels or pullies as the cause of the motion of a clock watch crane or other machine and at the same time suppose the motion of the engine to be the cause of the weight spring or moving force but this notwithstanding all the expense of geometry and mechanism that has been laid out upon it by its great patrons and defenders and its being so generally received on their authority as a first principle in physic is an evident impossibility  the first and best philosophers and physicians who applied themselves to the study of the animal economy by observing the great alteration made upon our common food by fermentation and digestion in the stomach whereby a liquor was prepared to be afterward farther conveyed to the several parts of the body while the excrementitious indigestible parts of the aliment were separated forced forward and thrown out of the body carried this reasoning by analogy of nature to the other glands and ventricles of the body where they supposed a farther concoction might in like manner be made and different liquors prepared and separated under different degrees of digestive heat and motion so as to answer the several ends and purposes of the animal constitution and herein they argued right and grounded their principles upon the true method and economy of nature in all other like cases but how far the moderns have mended this theory or any other practical principle of the ancients by any of the foregoing hypotheses or by their clearer knowledge of anatomy i may leave any one to judge  but besides the virtues properties or sensible effects of medicines as they visibly promoted or restrained this or the other natural evacuation the first and most successful students of this part of nature had another class of powers and properties in things given as they visibly and sensibly affected the animal constitution with regard to the primary or elementary qualities as they chose to call them of heat cold moisture and dryness or which is the same thing as things given whether a medicine or diet were found to heat or cool moisten or dry the solids in general and upon this they founded their notion of the four principal primary or elementary constitutions of hot and dry hot and moist cold and dry and cold and moist where these primary elementary qualities were found to be so equally mixed and contemperated as that any one of them did not abound or prevail against the rest this was called the natural temperature or state of health for while these elementary qualities were duly tempered and equally blended together the body remained sound and well and performed all its functions regularly and in good order and no disease or distemperature could ever be observed but upon the prevalency of some one or more of these qualities above the others and from hence in every disease the prevailing humors were distinguished into blood phlegm choler or bile and melancholy or black bile and the general constitutions were from thence denominated either sanguine phlegmatic cholorick or melancholy as this or that humor prevailed or had the ascendency in particular persons  now this i think is plain sense and talking very intelligibly and the moderns who have found out other hypotheses better methods of reasoning in physic and nearer ways to health as the event has plainly proved cannot pretend to be ignorant of what the ancients meant by blood phlegm choler or bile though they have been mightily puzzled to know what was understood and intended by their melancholic humor or black bile and yet he who does not understand this must either never have practiced physic or else never have made any observations and reflections on what he has seen and met with in practice for in my opinion it is extremely clear that the ancient physicians neither did nor could understand any thing else by their melancholia or bilis atra but the bile corrupted vitiated and degenerated from its natural state and use in which case it always turns black and becomes a peccant distempered humor it is true indeed that all the humors by stagnation corruption and fermentation may change their original colors and qualities as well as the bile which was as well known to the ancients as to the moderns and taken notice of by them accordingly but yet this corrupt bile when it prevails is so very extensive in its consequences and productive of so many and great diseases even where no jaundice ensues that it was justly taken notice of and distinguished by them as one of the principal general morbid constitutions and especially as this distemperature of the bile naturally and almost constantly attends a cold and dry state and habit of body or a prevalency of cold and dryness above heat and moisture in the general constitution  i am aware some trifling objections may be made to what i have advanced here but as they would all terminate in this that the ancients could not always express themselves accurately enough to be understood by the moderns so in answer to them without mentioning the particular objections it may be only said in general that the moderns in this case have been equally culpable in that they have not been always able to express themselves with sufficient clearness to be understood by one another but for any one gross absurdity or falsehood in fact which any man shall produce from the ancients about the cause formation and cure of diseases i will undertake in defense of the moderns upon this article to give him five  the ancients had indeed a particular notion that the blood is made in the liver to which viscus they ascribed the act of sanguification this opinion has been perhaps justly rejected by the moderns though they have not been able yet to settle any thing in the room of it and therefore have had no ground for the laugh the ancients it seems fell into this mistake for want of a clearer knowledge of anatomy well be it so but how have the moderns rectified this error by their farther discoveries and better acquaintance with the animal structure and economy or to what particular organ do they ascribe this act of sanguification perhaps it may be answered with some triumph here that the case is now very plain and that since the discovery of the elasticity of the air it is evident enough that the lungs are the only proper sanguifying organs where by the intromission of a fine elastick aura these globules are formed and blown up but this is a very strange account of the matter indeed since it is certain in fact that these globules are specifically heavier instead of being lighter than the serum and consequently that they cannot be vesicles or bubbles filled and blown up with air and had one therefore a mind to maintain the argument for the sake of the jest it would be no great difficulty in my opinion to defend the liver against the lungs in spite of all such reasonings as this  but he who would follow the guidance of nature and build his opinion herein on plain facts and observations may perhaps see reason to conclude that the act of sanguification is not appropriated to any particular viscus or bowel that the lungs contribute only their share in the operation and that the blood receives its peculiar type and form in the arteries where it undergoes the highest degrees of heat impetus and motion  for we may observe in old people where the natural heat and elastick tone of the solids are much impaired that the blood grows paler fainter and runs more into water and that the globular part or cremor sensibly lessens in proportion to the serum and this likewise is remarkably the case in a chlorosis or indeed any obstruction of the menstrual secretion attended with chilliness lowness pallor and languor in which cases we often see the globules almost lost and the blood is little else but serum but by restoring the natural heat and strengthening the elastick tone of the arteries these globules soon rise again and the crassamentum or cremor is reduced to its natural and due state whether this be done by any internal means or external only  thus it may likewise be observed that people of hot biliose and sanguine constitutions whose fibers are more firm and tense and where consequently the muscular force and action of the solids is stronger and more vigorous than in other temperaments have proportionally more cremor in the blood than others and in some high inflammatory fevers where the elastick force of the solids is still greater and more exalted the blood becomes almost all cremor and affords but very little serum after it has stood many hours in a cold place now from these observations to mention no more at present it may perhaps be justly concluded that the blood receives this form from the heat and elaboration it undergoes in the arteries  but to resume and consider a little farther the natural constitutions as depending on the primary or elementary qualities above mentioned it may be proper to take notice that the true alterative method of the ancients consisted in regulating and moderating these natural constitutions and primary qualities and this they did not pretend to do by specific alteratives in the modern quack sense or by any occult qualities or magical effect of medicines on the blood where people were not to know what they took or after what manner they were to expect relief but by a skilful direction and regimen in the use of those things which have i know not for what reason been commonly called the nonnaturals such as diet air exercise etc but i should rather choose to call these the universals or constitutionals because the original natural constitutions and primary qualities do almost entirely absolutely and universally depend upon them so far as moderating and tempering them can fall under the consideration of a physician  a flesh and ale diet increases the crassament of the blood and accumulates fat more than any thing else it oilifies and enriches the blood and promotes the heat and humidity of the constitution which is the characteristick of that temperament which by the ancients was called sanguine but when this constitution becomes intemperate and morbid it is the foundation of all those diseases which are owing to an overgrowth of fat and a too thick and rich blood  a milk and vegetable diet joined with waterdrinking increases the serum of the blood more than the crassament it cools refrigerates and moistens the habit or constitution moderately contracts the solids and promotes the alvine and urinary discharges but it has not the same effect on the cutaneous evacuations by sweat and perspiration which it rather lessens and restrains and yet by joining this regimen in diet to a moderate use of warm liquors or such as contain a vinous spirit any immoderate check or restraint of perspiration may easily be prevented as on the other hand vegetables and waterdrinking are in a good measure preventatives of the ill consequences which might otherwise follow from the too free use of a flesh and ale diet  the choice of air is undoubtedly of the utmost consequence to moderate and reduce a constitution when it grows into any intemperature and here the constitution of the air with regard to the primary qualities above mentioned compared with the constitution of the patient will afford any man a sure and unerring rule in the choice of air for it is certain that any error of constitution ought to be rectifyed and reduced by the contrary temper and quality of the air and no body would choose a hot air for a too hot constitution or a cold air for a cold one and so of the rest  in a phthisis or natural weakness of the lungs the softest and warmest air is to be chosen provided it be not too thick moist and boggy but in an asthma jaundice weakness and relaxation of the nerves and almost in all thin declining habits where the lungs are sound a thin cool dry and elastick air is always best and most eligible but gross fat and corpulent people can never be much mended by any air without a cooling attenuating vegetable diet and proper exercise  of all exercises for health as well as pleasure nothing can stand in competition with riding and swimming which wonderfully brace the nerves and solids in general restore their elastick tone open obstructions and promote the several natural secretions and evacuations beyond any other gymnastick regimen whatsoever  moderate sleep is the great solamen and restorative of nature by which the organs are warmed moistened and lubricated and the several springs of motion wound up and prepared for farther action in the waking hours but in this case excessive indulgence of sleep or overwatching and want of sleep are equally injurious to and produce different and contrary effects upon the constitution for excessive sleeping checks and restrains all the natural secretions and evacuations weakens and relaxes the whole animal frame destroys the tone of the muscles and induces such a weak cold humid and flabby state of the nerves as threatens a palsy and frequently terminates in one which i have more than once known to be the consequence of it  on the other hand overwatching and the want of natural sleep wears and wastes the whole animal constitution heats the blood drys and contracts the nerves and in fine either kills with a fever attended with a phrensy or induces a mania lunacy or distraction of some sort or other as is but too commonly seen and experienced  the passions have so great a share in the constitutions and diseases of the body that in my opinion this ought to be reckoned one of the principal provinces of physic and indeed with a saving to the divines i think physicians are the fittest persons to apply a proper relief under those great emotions and perturbations of mind which either arise from the body at first or are soon materializd by a communication with it for these passions are all either pleasing or painful images and have just the same effect upon the constitution whether they arise from things without us or have their original from the mind within  it is evident that the pleasurable and painful passions have very different and even quite contrary effects upon the blood humors and respective organs of the body of which a mechanical account and explanation may be seen in the ingenious dr morgans philosophical principles of medicine a book that can never be too much studied by the young physician who intends to make a figure in his profession and would build his practice on plain facts and indisputable principles to that treatise therefore i shall refer the curious reader where i can assure him he will find this subject touched with uncommon delicacy and see the origin and different modifications of the passions beautifully described and their effects on the animal organism in a strong and masterly manner anatomically delineated and mechanically accounted for which makes it the less necessary for me to enter farther into the theory of the matter here  it is evident in fact that hope and joy warm the blood diffuse the natural heat raise the pulse and take off any irritation or painful stimulus upon the organs and that fear and grief produce the quite contrary effects to all these but it is observable that grief is the most sinking wasting disanimating passion of all for fear very often inspires the person affected with a resolution and courage proportional to the apparent or apprehended danger and thereby arms him with suitable strength and firmness to encounter with the difficulties before him  hope and joy affect the blood and humors much after the same manner with vinous spirits opiates and other such exhilerating volatiles but grief and fear when they are strong and overbearing with acids and salts upon the stomach i e they affect the organs with pain lower the pulse repel the natural heat and disarm a man of spirit strength and resolution or perhaps keep him constantly awake and attentive to the painful disagreeable scene till he has quite lost his senses from this short account of the mechanical and most obvious effects of the passions the methods of relieving them when they grow exorbitant may be easily drawn and there is no need that i should farther insist on it here i had some thought indeed of being larger on the consideration of these constitutionals which we so improperly call nonnaturals but the bounds to which i must confine my self in this essay will not permit of a longer detail at present and i must therefore refer a more particular and distinct account of these matters to some fitter opportunity  sect ii of the materia medica in general notwithstanding the vastness of this subject i have no design to write a volume upon it nor do i think it necessary but considering the bulk to which the materia medica is grown it is certainly i think high time to come to some proper limitations and restrictions concerning it before it is quite run out into infinity for to such an excessive degree is this matter grown already that a man had almost as good read over all the acts of parliament and laws of england as the books of physic and the infinite jumble and confusion of remedys of one sort or another i am sensible indeed that the best and ablest physicians among us have very much reduced the materia medica and brought it into a narrow compass with respect to their own practice but this is no advantage to those who have not bought their experience at so dear a rate or who have not had opportunitys of making trials themselves but must still go on in their practice upon the judgments of such as have pretended to vast experience before them and who have hereupon cried up a prodigious number of simple and compound remedies as infallible and filled large volumes with them when perhaps few or none of them upon trial will be found to answer their character so that amidst this huge lumber a young practitioner must still be continually sifting out a medicine for his purpose in most cases like a pearl in the common rubbish or a needle in a heap of sand  this uncertainty and confusion in physic have not arisen from any of the obvious sensible properties or effects of medicines as they affect the natural evacuations or the primary constitutional qualities for here the practice stands upon a pretty good certainty but only from the vain and fruitless search after specificks in the modern absurd sense or rather nonsense of the word this as the matter appears to me has been the true cause of all such darkness and obscurity as we find the materia medica under to this very day i shall therefore under this section lay down some principles well established in fact which may serve as so many certain rules of judgment whereby the young physician may govern himself in the choice medicines so as to render his practice less precarious and uncertain than it otherwise might be upon his first setting out in the world and herein i shall proceed in this plain and natural method by considering how far the several parts of the materia medica as it now stands are digestible or indigestible in what cases and under what circumstances they are capable of passing the lacteals and mixing with the blood and what effects may be expected from them when they get there which will take in all i intend to say on this subject    then it is certain that nothing can pass the lacteals but what has been previously liquified and reduced to an effluvium or an exceeding fine thin and rarefyed vapor not only the fibrous solid parts of our common food but likewise the more fixed oils and salts with which it abounds are incapable of being dissolved liquifyed and volatilizd by the digestive heat and action of the stomach and the attractive power of the lacteals and therefore the residue of the aliment which cannot be resolved attenuated and fluxilized by such a degree of heat and motion during the time of concoction are by nature precipitated thrust forward and ejected out of the body through the common alvine excretory ducts and passages now if so considerable a part of our common aliment which has no stronger or closer texture than that of the vegetable and animal solids cannot be so far dissolved and attenuated in the stomach as to be strained off through the lacteals what shall we say to those vastly more solid and compact substances which are often given as specific alteratives or by what chemistry or mechanism can our specificians pretend to convey such substances as these into the blood without first rendering them by some previous operation soluble and fluxilizable in water  sulphur aethiops cinnabar antimony mineral bezoar and universally all mineral glebes and metalline calces communicate nothing to boiling water but their parts remain fixed inseparable and unalterable against all the power of such a degree of heat and motion which is yet vastly greater than can be produced by the natural digestive heat and action of the stomach during the time of concoction nay if the parts of any such solid cohering substances be first of all broken and divided as far as possible by any grinding or trituration whatever yet still when they are afterward committed to boiling water such a degree of heat and motion makes no alteration and cannot break or divide them farther but after all their smallest parts when examined by a microscope will appear to be many thousand times larger than any of the orifices of the lacteals of which any person may easily be convinced upon trial and consequently he who expects to pass such particles through the lacteals into the blood even after their utmost trituration and consequent maceration in any liquor which the stomach can bear will find himself deceived and may as well attempt to thread a needle with a cable or to speak according to our english translation it is as impossible as for a camel to go through the eye of a needle    such metalline substances as above mentioned may indeed be converted into the form of a salt by the power of strong acids such as oil of vitriol spirit of nitre etc as is well known to the chemists and in this case they become soluble in water and may be volatilizd in it to any assignable degree of tenuity but then they are converted into poisons and cannot be thought fit alteratives unless the intended alteration be death  i know that some of these metalline acid salts may be given in some cases as emeticks and catharticks bu tthen as they are not intended to pass into the blood but to be presently thrown out of the body together with such other morbid matter as they derive from the remote parts so in no case whatever should they be exhibited as alteratives in a long continued course of medicine nor indeed used for any other purpose but with the greatest caution and upon the utmost necessity they are edged tools and never to be meddled with without some danger  it is true indeed that some physicians have recommended even the alterative power of poisons when the first passages are guarded against them and they are safely conveyed into the blood and remote recesses of the body but upon what principles this practice is founded i own is beyond my comprehension would any but a madman trust an enemy in his house or closet that he knows would murder him in the open street or is it conceivable that the much thinner finer and tenderer coats and membranes of the remote glands and smallest vessels under such recluses should be able to bear the power of so vast a stimulus better than the stomach it self where there is so free and open a discharge  it is well known that poisoning has been made an art of and reckoned a principal part of magic and it has been reported of the indians and some italians that they can give poisons to operate in a certain assignable time either longer or shorter without producing any present ill consequences when first exhibited this method of poisoning indeed might perhaps receive vast improvement from such a notion of alteratives but as this does not belong to physic i shall leave the consideration of it to others and since no method has yet been discovered of governing and directing the venenous particles when got into the habit to the morbid matter only or of preventing their baneful impression and deleterious effects on every part of the animal frame and constitution i shall not only absolutely reject the internal use of any such sort of medicines but draw one practical conclusion from the whole which i take to be of great importance sc that any medicine endued with a strong emetick or cathartick stimulus should never be suffered to lie long in the body or to pass the lacteals where it is capable of it but ought to be thrown off as soon as possible by the nearest outlets and properest excretorys together with such other matter as it has derived and prepared for evacuation  but besides those things that are absolutely indissoluble and cannot be conveyed into the blood at all and such as by reason of their violent stimulus and corrosive qualities ought not to be trusted there there is another sort of medicines which might justly be expelled the province of physic under this notion of specific alteratives though they are not absolutely indigestible nor endued with any hurtful stimulus what i here aim at is the testacea resins boles and earths which will not impart a tincture so as to be liquifyed and volatilizd with water or any other common potable liquor  any of these when retained in the body must necessarily clog and obstruct the primary concoctive organs and do more mischief in a little time than all the advantages that can be expected from them for as they cannot be sufficiently resolved liquifyed and sublimated by the natural digestive heat of the stomach so as to pass the lacteals they must needs foul and obstruct the first passages impair the appetite suppress the natural heat weaken the force of the muscles and elastick fibers in general and by continuance induce an atrophy of the worst sort which arises from an obstruction of the lacteals and a consequent depravation of digestion and loss of appetite  but while i am exploding and setting aside these things as alteratives or with regard to any good effects they can have upon the remote glands and membranous vesicles i would not be thought to maintain or suppose that they may not at least some of them be of use in particular cases by their present effects on the first passages provided they are extruded and thrown out of the body by emeticks or catharticks as soon as they have answered their proper intention but this will be farther explained in some of the following sections  another principal thing to be regarded in the practice of physic is the doses of medicines and the manner of exhibiting them for it is certain that where a medicine is never so good and efficacious and capable of answering the intention of the physician of it self yet still this effect may be eluded and nature deprived of the expected and intended relief by a wrong method of exhibition or by an error committed either in the quantitys or forms of such simple or simples on which the whole intention of cure depends  and nothing in my opinion has proved more prejudicial in the practice of physic than the stated canonical doses of medicines whether simple or compound when once a man imagines himself to be pinned down in the giving of medicines to any stated authorized doses he must not go beyond it though he should miss of his intention and lose his patient and from hence one may venture to say that more hurt has been done by trifling with efficacious medicines and thereby losing time than by mistaking the case and directing things contrary to the intention of cure  but this error is oftnest committed in the case of compounds which are commonly looked upon and regarded as so many canons in physic and consequently entitled to an absolute and implicit obedience and conformity but as this is certainly the prudential orthodox method of trifling and of doing a great deal of mischief by doing no good so i dare be bold to say that he who shall govern himself by these rules without using his own judgment in varying the doses and forms as occasion requires will not only oftentimes lose his patient but his reputation into the bargain  it is certain that the art of composition in medicine upon which all our common dispensatorys are founded arose with the specific or corpuscularian philosophy and with that it must sink again for while the practice stood upon this chimaerical foundation the physician for want of being acquainted with the obvious sensible qualities and effects of medicines and the method that unassisted nature took to relieve her self under any particular disorder could have no other intention in his medical processes than to cure by magic or occult qualities and consequently must conclude that his chance of success always rose in proportion to the number of ingredients in the compound remedy but an extemporaneous practice is certainly the only true and rational method of practicing physic as this may by the physician who knows what he is about be always accommodated to the great variety and complication of symptoms in particular cases and nothing surely can be more absurd and irrational than extemporaneous general prescriptions or stated canonical compound remedys  whoever considers the most common prevailing compounds will find them to be a general confused jumble of simples of very different virtues and properties and consequently not containing upon the whole the real power or efficacy of any one ingredient in the whole composition and if any such general artificial composition should happen to answer the intention in some particular cases it is more by chance than any thing else and in these canonical compounds it may be pretty generally observed that the simple that gives it the name or from which the denomination is taken has the least share in the composition and might do much better alone or with any easy extemporaneous management  but besides this art of composition or confounding all virtues and properties together there is another artificial method of spoiling or rendering useless and insignificant the best and most efficacious simples by pretending to preserve and secure their original native effects and virtues in their distilled waters syrups confections and conserves  simple and compound waters drawn from vegetables are for the most part simply ineffectual as to any intention for which they are given and he who makes use of them for any other purpose than as vehicles for medicines of greater efficacy will always find himself disappointed and even for this purpose the simple or low distilled waters not having strength enough generally to keep from mothering and spoiling upon hand are not half so good as common water or fresh small beer but the compound waters which are raised to a proof spirit may some of them at least do very well and be thought pleasant enough as a dram though i think most of em are fitter to be sold at inns and coffeehouses than the apothecarys shops  the medicated syrups are if possible still more insignificant for excepting a few of them which are intended as purgatives there is not one of them capable of answering any other intention in physic and since they are chiefly used in juleps as specific sweetners by the physician and as sugar it self would do much better and render the medicine more agreeable and less nauseous i think they may be very well left to the apothecary for the purpose of particular forms and to make up dry substances into boles pills and electuaries  confections and conserves may likewise answer some such use as to give an agreeable relish or to bring electuaries to a due consistence but otherwise their medicinal virtues may very well be spared  but by decoctions infusions and tinctures the native essential oils and salts of simples may be extracted so far as the natural heat of the stomach is capable of doing it and since all the proper medicinal virtues and powers of the simples themselves consists and resides in these salts and oils by such a preparation and management they may certainly be given to vastly greater advantage than in their common gross substances for by this all the efficacy of the simples may be obtained fresh and pure and to any given degree as the case requires so as to come up fully to the intention and hereby also the stomach may be saved the difficulty and inconvenience of solution digestion and separation of the parts which is done beforehand in this way of preparation to the great assistance of nature for it cannot certainly be a rational method or good contrivance to commit gross solid and stronglycohering substances to a sick weak and distempered stomach which cannot perhaps retain and digest any ordinary solid food  and from the same mechanism and chemistry of nature it must likewise follow that all nauseous sickening and loathsome medicines ought as much as possible to be avoided that is they ought absolutely to be avoided and never given or urged at all for it is a hard case indeed when a weak languid patient must be forced with things which he could never have taken in his best health without loathing reluctance and sensible disorder  the notion of specificks and the vain pretense of curing diseases by the occult operation of medicines upon the blood has been the true ground of all such violence offered to nature for if the disease is to be cured by things which are to affect the blood after a secret and inexplicable manner the patient must believe and suffer for the sake of health against all sensible appearances to the contrary for no doubt the specific remedys will do their work and faithfully execute their commission when they get into the blood and arrive at the seat of the disorder whatever mischief or injury they may occasion to the constitution before they get there  i have made these observations which appear to me plainly necessary with regard to the general use and application of the materia medica for the sake of such gentlemen only as shall think it worth their while to form their conduct upon the reason and nature of things and build their practice on facts and experiments and if such regulations should happen to throw out a great part of its many particulars i hope however it may serve to improve the art of healing which is all i aim at  sect iii of stimulating and quieting medicines the doctrine of stimulation and pacification or the effects of pain and pleasure is of so vast an extent in physic and so essentail to all animal mechanism that i thought it a matter of the utmost importance to consider this part of the materia medica in a distinct section by it self  pain or uneasiness is the universal stimulus or principle of motion in all animal mechanism when it arises from the body it has a material cause and though when it arises from the mind and has no other cause but the various modifications of good and evil as they appear to the judgment or understanding yet still it may be observed that this mere mental pain when impressed on the animal organism will have just the same effect on it as if it had originally arisen from some material stimulus and in this case altering the judgment and thereby exciting pleasure affects the animal constitution much after the same manner as a vinous spirit volatile salt opium or any other material pacifyer and this consideration is of such consequence that without it there can be no such thing as either the knowledge or application of animal mechanism to the purpose of my present subject but having observed this once for all i shall confine my self in what remains to the consideration of material stimulation and pacification where the pain or pleasure stimulation or pacification arise from without and may be ascribed to some material cause  it is well know that the active principles of bodies are their salts and oils and that these variously affect the animal solids and fluids as they are pungent and vellicating or softening and lubricating fixed or volatile heating and rarefying or cooling and condensing nor are there any operations of stimulating and quieting medicines but what may be understood and explained by these their obvious sensible properties or mechanical effects  it may be observed farther that an organ may be stimulated vellicated or put to pain either by an immoderate distention or compression for in either of these cases the original structure and conformation of the organ or vessel must be altered and broken the natural indication or notification of which in the animal constitution is pain a stimulus therefore may be either hot or cold i e the stimulating substance may either be a strong rigid condensative salt or a heating rarifying or pungent oil  in a cold condensative stimulus the afflux and weight of the fluids toward the organs or vessels stimulated and the evacuations depending thereon will be increased and when any such stimulus is too strong and powerful the afflux of the fluids to the stimulated parts will overbear the contractile restitutive force of the solids in which case the parts must swell mortify and gangrene or the stimulus will act as a poison and the person thus affected dies under all the pain and torture of such an erosion in the full force and vigor of his senses without any stupor or lethargick symptoms  but in a hot rarefactive stimulus the symptoms will be very different which i shall here briefly consider and explain for though the swelling of the stimulated part will always be caeteris paribus in proportion to the quantity of the fluid flowing to the part yet in this case of a hot rarefactive stimulus the organ or vessel will be considerably more inflated and distended by the action of the heated rarefied air included in the fluid and the circumjacent vessels necessarily compressed and constringed to a greater degree and consequently the influx of their fluids will be interrupted or lessened in proportion now the effects of this inflation or distention will be most remarkable and sensible when it happens in the stomach which is the principal and original seat of the action of medicines and here the heating rarefying oil acting upon this organ and inflating or distending it more or less may in its effects prove either sedative pacifying and composing sickening surfeiting and stimulating or stupifying lethargick and mortal according to the different degree of such inflation and the different power of the cause or counterforce which it acts against  let us suppose then the pulse lowered the natural heat repelled the perspiration checked the tide of the vital fluid sunk and depressed and consequently the membranes of the stomach intestines and viscera tumifyed and relaxed from a redundancy and surcharge of fluids occasioned and brought on by fasting watching hard labor immoderate purging and vomiting and the like cause and it is well know that in such cases a moderate quantity of wine or any generous heating and rarifying liquor abounding with a vinous spirit or volatile oil will give a very great and sudden relief by diffusing the natural heat raising the pulse and restoring the perspiration if this warm effluvium and consequent inflation of the stomach be carried somewhat farther all the foregoing effects of it will be increased the pulse will rise higher the external heat will be greater and the augmented perspiration will break out into sweats which sweats in such a case are vastly beneficial as they deterge and purge the cutaneous glands and excretory ducts which were before obstructed by the induration and concretion of their contained matter  but if this distention of the stomach shall be still increased so as more strongly to compress the descending aorta and viscera contained in the abdomen and to throw a greater quantity of blood upwards through the more patent canals this increase by compressing the nerves in their origin will fix them and induce sleep which will be more or less sound and of longer or shorter continuance according to the different power and efficacy of the cause but when this cause is raised to its highest degree and acts with an overbearing strength and violence it produces a lethargy apoplexy and mortal stupor under which the person thus affected dies senseless and convulsed especially in the lower parts which derive their blood from the descending trunk of the aorta while the superior muscles which are overcharged with blood remain fixed and in a manner motionless but the direct contrary to all this happens when a person dies under the power of any stimulating acid or saline poison and from hence it may appear that alkaline and acid poisons are a sort of antidotes or counterpoysons to each other for as vinous spirits and volatile oils and salts especially opium mitigate the violence of corrosive salts and acids so do these restrain and moderate the other and from hence it is evident that life or death killing or curing depend on the different use of the same things and what is a necessary antidote in one case or method of exhibition will under different circumstances act as a deadly poison  emeticks and catharticks differ only in the degree of their vellication or stimulus if their stimulating power be such as to act immediately on the stomach before they can pass farther they prove emetick and are thrown off by vomiting but where the rigid stimulating salts or acids are intimately united with a soft lubricating oil in the essential texture and constitution of the medicine it self this qualifying oil is not presently separated from the more ponderous fixed oil and pungent salts and consequently the stimulation of the medicine may not be sensible in the stomach nor its action perceived till it comes into the intestines where it operates as a purge  as emeticks and catharticks differ from each other in the degree of their stimulus so they differ very considerably among themselves according to their different strength or stimulating power or as their stimulating salts and ponderous oils are more or less tempered and qualifyed with a soft lymph and lubricating nutritious oil but of all catharticks the strong purgative resins artificially drawn upon spirit of wine are the most detrimental and attended with the worst consequences as the repeated use of them most sensibly impairs the appetite obstructs the lacteals and fouls clogs and weakens the concoctive organs and viscera in general and this i think one may lay down as a certain rule that where nature has prepared a medicine it can never be much mended by art  jalap in its natural state is perhaps one of the best general purgatives in the world for though it possesses a sufficient stimulating power to answer the end of a purge even where strong and quick purging is requisite yet it abounds at the same time with phlegm and oil enough to correct and moderate its operation so as to render it safe as well as effectual which good properties the artificial resin is deprived of nor can any art afterward restore them again if this cathartick can be at all improved it is by mixing and grinding the powdered root with about a third part of calomel which makes it more attenuating dissolvent and detersive and at the same time lessens its stimulus and the adhesive quality of its resin  gutta gamba makes a quick safe and excellent purge in dropsies or wherever strong purging is required when corrected with mercury and though in its natural state it be too violent and stimulating in its operation to be given to any but grown persons and those of strong and robust constitutions yet under this management i can affirm from a constant course of experience for many years that it may be exhibited with great safety to the tenderest habits and most delicate constitutions and this indeed in general is the only method of correcting every thing possessed with a powerful stimulus or at least as far as i have yet found  rhubarb is a very moderate purgative but a great astringent and strengthner of the stomach and bowels when they are too lax and flaccid and when given with about a third part of english saffron is an excellent and noble diuretic in all great relaxations of the renal glands and urinary passages but when it is made up into pills with quicksilver first minutely divided and incorporated with any proper subject of the turpentine kind its purgative quality is greatly strengthened and improved for where the first passages are foul and stuffed with a load of matter which wants to be evacuated rhubarb thus given will work as much as jalap given alone or in its natural state and this without any pain or sickness or uneasy stimulus whatsoever and this as i said before is the true art of correcting not only emeticks and catharticks but all other medicines which would otherwise act by a too powerful and overbearing stimulus on the stomach and intestines for hereby the attenuating dissolving and deobstruent powers of the medicine are increased and strengthened and at the same time the stimulus and vellication on the great organs lessened in the same proportion and indeed a physician ought never to suffer a medicine to act by any powerful or too violent a stimulus so as to occasion excessive pain because in this case it comes near to a poison and threatens a mortification or gangrene of the part thus stimulated and whenever this happens accidentally and beside the intention the only effectual way to prevent farther mischief and to quiet and pacify the tumult raised in the constitution is immediately to give a sufficient quantity of some powerful volatile especially opium to take off the pain and thereby to prevent the fatal effects of such a stimulation  sudorificks act counter to emeticks and catharticks and the operations of these are caeteris paribus reciprocally proportional almost every body must have observed that a sweat raised stops a diarrhoea and that the checking of sweat and perspiration occasions a diarrhoea if the intestines are not obstructed too at the same time the reason and mechanism of this is very evident for as all muscular mechanical or necessary motion is propagated from the heart undiquaque in the direction of the arterial blood it is plain that when the fluids move in a surplus quantity from the heart inwards toward the stomach and intestines and their evacuation that way is increased by any cause whatsoever the discharges in the contrary direction toward the external surface or cutaneous emunctories must be diminished in the same proportion and so vice versa reciprocally and hereupon is grounded the true rational method of curing a diarrhoea  sudorificks diuretics and catharticks and indeed all other medicines universally will operate differently according to the different constitution in general or the present occasional state of the animal economy with regard to the primary elementary qualities before mentioned and here the different powers of heat and cold or of rarefaction and condensation compared with the different state of the solids and fluids or with the nature of the disease as effluent or influent must be the physicians guide every one knows that heating and cooling rarefying and condensing medicines will either promote or restrain perspiration and sweat in their place and turns or under different circumstances no man therefore who knows what he is about would attempt to promote sweat and perspiration by heating rarefying volatiles where the cutaneous discharges had been obstructed and retained by a too great efflux and diffusion of heat before or endeavor to promote this evacuation by cooling refrigerating salts and acids in a low languid and depressed state of the blood and animal fluids and yet as wrong and irrational as this evidently appears to be any person who is but moderately acquainted with the modern practical physical writers especially those in the specific way must have observed that very little regard has been had in practice especially in fevers to this plain obvious and indisputable principle sudorificks and diaphoreticks therefore ought to be of one sort or the other or the simples of each kind variously compounded in extemporaneous practice from a careful and judicious observation of the difference in the simple or complicated symptoms and this farther shows the vanity and absurdity of stated canonical compounds or general recipes under the infinite diversity and various complications of diseases and their symptoms but yet i must needs say notwithstanding the general doctrine here laid down that there is one preparation of nature so nicely tempered and adjusted with respect to heating and cooling that in this intention o promoting perspiration and sweat and thereby carrying off the foulnesses and impurities of the glands by the cutaneous emunctories is almost universally beneficial what i mean here is opium which at all times and almost in all cases greatly promotes the sudorifick and diaphoretick indications whether the general intention and the medicines with which it is joined be otherwise heating or cooling rarefying or condensing  but where perspiration and sweating are necessary and the intention cannot otherwise be obtained which often happens in fevers nothing can come into competition with blistering which is not only a safe but a sure refuge on such occasions and this is so effectual to the purpose here mentioned that it is great pity it should ever be made the last resort after other methods have been tried in vain and when perhaps this may come too late especially since in the modern method of directing and governing it the most dreaded and usual mischievous consequences of this operation are so easily prevented  to close this section i shall only make one observation more as a matter of great importance and that is that the metalline salts or such as are prepared by impregnating and incorporating metals especially iron and copper with their proper dissolving menstruums whether acid or alkaline are in many great cases the most effectual remedies of all as they may be directed to any of the natural emunctories by a skilful and judicious management and become then the most certain and efficacious dissolvents deobstruents and detergents of any thing yet known but a full discussion of this cannot fall within the bounds of a short essay though something farther will be observed upon it in the following sections  sect iv of absorbents it is certain that some sorts of substances which are in themselves indigestible and which can by no means pass the lacteals or mix with the blood do yet most powerfully attract imbibe and retain the morbid salts acids and sulphurs or inflammatory oil which is often thrown on the first passages in fevers and other diseases of the putrefactive kind and on this account such sort of medicines may be of great use in physic provided that sufficient care be taken to extrude them out of the body as soon as they have done their work and saturated themselves with the morbid matter by this means the peccant humor is discharged and cast out together with the medicine that had attracted and imbibed it but nothing surely can be more irrational and absurd than the giving such medicines under the notion of their digestibility and alterative effects in the blood as if the stomach could work miracles and by its natural heat and motion dissolve that which no art can do by degrees of heat and motion vastly greater and besides if such substances were supposed capable of being dissolved and liquifyed in the stomach so as to be strained off through the lacteals and lymphatick recipients yet still as in this case they must necessarily carry the morbid fomes along with them which they had before imbibed and retained and thereby corrupt and poison the whole mass so consequently the practice in this view would be rather more absurd and irrational than before  it may be here observed that such sort of substances are the best absorbents as are good for nothing else and have no other remarkable property whatsoever such as chalk dry earths powdered shells burnt hartshorn and the mineral glebes which have been first deprived of their salts sulphurs and mercury or stripped of their active qualities by proper chemical processes such as diaphoretick antimony mineral bezoar etc i cannot therefore wholly condemn these things as of no use at all in physic especially the minerals before mentioned as some very considerable physicians have done particularly that prince of the faculty the great and learned boerhaave because they could find them possessed of no active qualities and could easily prove them to be absolutely indigestible and indissoluble in the stomach by the clearest and most convincing experiments for notwithstanding their passiveness in other respects yet it is certain they still retain the common power of attraction and as they attract absorb and retain salts acids and sulphurs with the greater force and efficacy for having been deprived and divested of them before so in this way of preparation of them they may i think be deservedly reckoned some of the most efficacious absorbents in the materia medica but then when the use of such indigestible substances is too long continued which it always must be when they are directed under the notion of alteratives or where they are too long retained in the body and due care is not taken to get rid of them as soon as they have answered their intention they must neccssarily produce effects very mischievous to the constitution and such as may in some cases be absolutely irretrievable and herein dr boerhaaves observations and reasonings upon this subject are certainly right  sect v of deobstruents deobstruents act by attenuating liquifying and deterging or carrying off the viscid concretions of matter lodged in the ventricles of the glands and membranous cells throughout the whole body but especially those of the mesentery and viscera of the abdomen which are most liable to be thus obstructed and where the obstructions are commonly the most obstinate and invincible  in all cases of obstructions great regard is to be had to the nature and quality of the obstructing and retained matter as whether it be a cold sluggish indurated phlegm or a heating acrid concreted oil and salt and as this is nothing but observing the primary elementary qualities in the constitution of every disease so it is only to be known by carefully regarding the general temperament of the patient the antecedent causes by which the obstruction may have been brought on and the particular symptoms and appearances of the present morbid constitution and this distinction is of such consequence that all true practice depends upon it  in all obstructions occasioned by a cold unactive indurated lymph or phlegm where the complexion is pale the pulse low the natural digestive heat impaired and the serum of the blood very much abounding in proportion to the crassament in such cases i say steel joined with the warm bitters and aromaticks is a great and noble deobstruent it raises the pulse strengthens the digestion diffuses the natural heat restores the elastick tone of the arteries and in a little time recovers the crassament of the blood to a wonder after it had been almost quite lost and run into water  but on the other hand when the obstructions are occasioned by a hot acrid concreted oil and salt tending to erosion and ulceration or where the natural heat is excessive and the crassament of the blood is very predominant in proportion to the serum steel in this case can hardly be born at all and will be sure to do more hurt than good for as steel is indisputably one of the warmest deobstruents in the materia medica so it is from thence evident it can have no place as a medicine here and can only then be proper when the obstruction proceeds from a contrary cause or a cold acid condensative coagulation and in this case it is instar omnium and has not its equal  but the great universal deobstruent which may be accommodated to all cases and suited to all constitutions is mercury or quicksilver which is deservedly styled by belloste a miracle of nature and the greatest gift of providence in the whole materia medica this noble and divine medicament being first well cleansed and purifyed from its original arsenical sulphur and all other artificial heterogeneous mixtures and impurities may be given with the greatest safety to the youngest tenderest and most delicate subjects and when under a skilful management may be directed to any of the natural emunctories so as to prove sudorifick cathartick diuretic expectorating or salivatory in any degree according to the nature constitution and appearances of diseases and their various indications and intentions of cure and this i can confidently affirm from my own experience in repeated trials of it upon my self and others for a course of many years together i confess indeed that i have never yet observed any great or sensible effects from it beyond the first passages when taken by ounces at a time in the vulgar method and quack way of prescription and notwithstanding the facts published in the controversy on this subject which seem to prove the contrary yet i am still of opinion that the relief obtained in those cases was purely accidental and owing rather to the casual separation and division of some part of the quicksilver into its minutissima in its passage through the stomach and intestines from the long continued repetition of the doses than to any natural or necessary comminution of it by the digestive heat and muscular action of those organs but however it be thus much i think is certain that it does not so quickly easily and surely pass the lacteals in that way of exhabiting it as when it is antecedently divided by art and intimately combined and incorporated with other bodies and in this way of management i may venture to affirm it will seldom or never disappoint the judicious physicians intention even in diseases of the most obstinate chronick kind where any relief is reasonably to be hoped for or expected but a particular consideration of this matter would open one into too large a field for a short essay such as i only intend this to be and besides as i can give the world some assurance of seeing this subject more thoroughly handled by an abler pen i shall choose to refer to that treatise which i believe will be soon published and in which i am confident the reader will find his account  i shall therefore conclude this section with one remark more by way of caution to the quicksilver devourers especially such of them as take vast quantities of it out of mere whim and wantonness which is this that though quicksilver be in it self perhaps the most innocent thing in nature and absolutely incapable of hurting the most delicate constitution if taken pure and in moderate quantities yet since it will intimately mix and incorporate with other metals especially lead with which it is but too commonly adulterated and which it will so strongly attract and retain as not to be separated from it again by any sort of straining or other manual operation i say since this is the case it may be worth such persons while to consider whether quicksilver thus sophisticated with a metal endued with such noxious qualities may not in a long course of taking it become a slow poison and do more future mischief to the constitution than can be balanced by any present sensible relief or advantage whatsoever  for my own part i freely acknowledge i dare not give it even in small quantities for a long time together without being well assured of its purity and though a person of judgment may pretty well discover upon view from the degree of its luster polish and fluidity whether it be greatly adulterated or not yet i am very sure from a great number of experiments that a sufficient quantity of noxious particles may be so intimately blended with and retained by it as not only to deceive the nicest eye and elude all other methods of trial short of the fiery one but to do a great deal of mischief in a long course of taking it in surplus quantities according to the common way for which reason i never prescribe quicksilver but as revived from cinnabar or redistilled according to art after it is got into the apothecarys hands  i had here some thoughts of considering the materia medica more particularly in another section and of ranging and disposing the most approved and efficacious simples in their most natural and proper order but i must postpone this to another opportunity for the reasons already given and the rather because i intend one day or other if i have time and leisure to make the necessary experiments to trouble the world with a new pharmacopoeia upon this plan in which i propose accurately to reexamine the whole materia medica both chemically and mechanically and to dispose the most efficacious simples in every intention in distinct classes according to their most obvious sensible powers and properties with regard to the primary elementary qualities and natural evacuations and to place them in such a natural order according to their different degrees of power and force in each intention that none but empyricks or such as have little or no acquaintance with philosophy and the animal structure and economy shall be easily capable of erring in the use and application of them  in this examen the reader i believe foresees that the materia medica which in its present state is enormously bulky will be greatly reduced and brought into a very narrow compass but however because i would give no offense to any gentlemen of the faculty especially the specificians who may possibly think themselves neglected if not injured by this method of treating the subject i farther intend for their use and the entertainment of others though it will cost me no small pains to take due notice of the remaining simples which for want of proper criteria cannot be entitled to a place in the rational part of this pharmacopoeia and which have no claim to any regard or esteem at all but on the foot of magic and specificism these i shall place in opposite columns and in distinct classes likewise according to their traditional occult virtues and qualities from the best authorities by this way of proceeding the true state of the controversy between the mechanical and specific gentlemen will at once be exhibited to view and if i am not much mistaken will appear in so strong a light that a man of no great abilities may easily determine on which side the weight of the argument lies and whether the newtonian philosopher who confines his reasonings to plain facts and just experiments or the corpuscularian and rosicrucian who is led by his imagination into all the lengths of whimsy and enthusiasm is like to prove the better and more useful physician  under this article likewise it will clearly appear from the manifest contradiction of the authorities produced in the course of the evidence that for one true fact upon record in the history of specificism you have ten falsities that the argument therefore from authority only has as little weight in physic as in divinity and consequently that the freethinker in the one profession as well as in the other has ten times a better chance of being in the right in all cases whatsoever than the freebeliever or enthusiast  finis
