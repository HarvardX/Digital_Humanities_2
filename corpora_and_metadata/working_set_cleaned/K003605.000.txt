quenquam esse deorum  the love of gain emilius  the author the author though often the heart when raging passions storm to vice we kneel and fain would veil her form her native darkness ever mocks disguise and crimes look foul even in their authors eyes here the first mark of heavenly vengeance view vice false to others to herself is true when the packed jury and the quibbled flaw delude the eye and lame the arm of law when erskines wit the culpritclient saves and fraud unscourged offended justice braves still is the wretch in private doomed to hear from his own heart a verdict more severe there dwells a judge whose voice no bribe can pay no party silence and no flattery sway the sinner shrinks before himself arraigned and almost sorrows that his cause is gained nor does his guilt himself alone disgust the world condemns for here the world is just unpunished crimes still shock the public ear and crimes unpunished doubly foul appear then why emilius thus in furious strain of broken faith and laws corrupt complain less warmth my testy friend more justly sound your injurys depth nor call your scratch a wound with plenteous store by fortunes bounty blessed of bonds and stock and fertile lands possessed your loss is trifling and so trite your case scarce in the public prints twill find a place while then we mark your breast with passion rise your trembling lips clenchd hands and flashing eyes when asked the cause how poor the answer sounds a friend is false i have lost a thousand pounds  a friend is false does that amaze the eye which lately saw its sixtieth year go by has age then bleachd your raven locks in vain impaired your limbs and not maturd your brain oh mourn your dross no more with tears lament your mind unfurnished and your time misspent blessed is the man whom philosophic lore beyond proud fortunes reach has taught to soar who when she frowns her falsehood not reviles nor boasts her favor when the harlot smiles nor him less happy count whose years have bought precious experience and deepsearching thought wisdom to know all bliss is insecure courage to hope and patience to endure say loud complainant does the rolling year present one day from fraud or knavery clear whose spotless white no thefts no murders stain writing in blood mans damning lust for gain in vain you search  yet still the search pursue examine men and find of good how few so few alas that if that guilt to fly which daily hourly here disgusts the eye the just resolved to leave the british strand and seek some distant less polluted land the whole fair troop away with ease might bear my lordmayors barge and still have room to spare now let the iron age no more be blamed blessed should its memory be when ours is named for which no bard can find in natures page so base a metal as would mark the age yet though ourselves still sin not less we blame our neighbors sin and when he errs exclaim louder than fishwives scold or asses bray or vapid puffs his own dry dull damned play allhail mouthvirtue at your altar bend each canting hypocrite and perjured friend spare lovegold sees his household god in you who cost no sixpence and who seem peru boywitted elder must thou still be told no sorcerers spell can witch an heart like gold that in each guinea conquering cupids swarm and venus less than good king george can charm hear you not how the rude but wiser crowd mock your simplicity with laughter loud when raving about faith and virtuous dread and lightnings destined for each perjured head you hope the traitor by your threats dismayed will keep the promise which he can evade if such things were twas sure ere adam fell or eve lost eden for a nonpareil but now a debt if some strange man should own when neither bond or witness prove the loan to mark an act so just and truth so rare his marble form should grace some public square and his name blazoned in the historic page attest that one good man adorned our age for me whenever such acts of faith i hear lost in amaze and trusting scarce mine ear let all i cry to view this wonder run and pidcock keeper of the exhibition at exeter change own his rarities outdone mourn hapless pidcock mourn your reign is over in vain your eagles scream and tigers roar the crowds who erst to view your monsters ran now seek a rarer sight an honest man what drinks what eats he for i never can think like common mortals he can eat or drink how speaks how walks he ere i sleep tonight on this rare creature i must feast my sight and when at length this wonder i behold amazed to find him cast in human mould i am vexed that like ourselves on earth he treads and scarce believe he hasnt got two heads but say emilius if a wrong thus slight so wounds thy feelings and disgusts thy sight how would thou rave if frauds glib tongue had found the means to reave thee of thy last poor pound or how support a friends more guilty stealth when loss of freedom follows loss of wealth turn to yon prison list yon captives tale who rashly stood his smoothtongud brothers bail pent in those walls the wretch all hope resigns now wildly raves and now dejected pines while his free life abroad the debtor spends enjoys new pleasure and defrauds new friends  emilius oh but my wretch so wondrous well deceived suspicions self had sure his faith believed he swore such oaths  the author he swore did that prevail and were thou blinded by a trick so stale oaths now are trifles few refuse to take easy to form and easier still to break their perjured vows but few with horror scan but few fear heavenly wrath if safe from man or shuddering think their guilt that angels know the secret sin a secret still below marked you when late your cause in court was tried and your false friend his lawful debt denied one slight convulsion or one transient blush bid his lip quiver or his forehead flush falterd his tongue when lost all sacred fear on god he called to prove his words sincere and wished if just your charge to curse his sin flames might consume himself and all his kin no such his earnest air and changeless face each word each look such candor seemed to grace so firm his voice so bold and clear his eye yourself could scarce believe his tale a lie  emilius it is true it is true with horror struck i heard the unblushing villain speak the damning word gods how can man thus brave celestial ire while heaven has justice and while hell has fire  the author alas my friend an awful truth to tell there are who scorn that heaven and mock that hell in vain for these alternate seasons reign spring robes the fields and autumn swells the grain in vain the moon now gilds the brow of night and now the sun pours floods of glorious light it was chance they cry to those fair orbs gave birth and chance alone with produce blessed the earth then boldly on the sacred book they lay their lips to swear some good mans wealth away and while his spoils their ravished eyes bewitch laugh at poor rogues less impious and less rich others whom timid guilt forbids to climb those dreadful heights where atheists soar sublime own that a power supreme exists on high but while they own a power that power defy to these the priest inspired describes in vain each promised pleasure and each threatened pain heavens future joys their notice scarce seem worth wealth in this world their present heaven on earth nor fear they to deserve the eternals curse hell bad it is true but want of money worse let wrath divine thus gripe in transport cries curse every limb and quench my blasted eyes if still harmonious sounds mine ears may drink while in yon chest my counted guineas chink and still my palsied hands have power to hold close to my heart this bag of darling gold what shall i fear indignant heaven to see its magazine of plagues exhaust on me what shall i mourn the bargain made if wealth i buy with loss of fame and loss of health no still with glad content my heart shall beat though tortures rack my hands my eyes my feet if hoards of gold my bursting coffers fill gold which can soothe each pang each fear can still comfort for every care and balm for every ill yet why these fears celestial wrath we know though just is merciful though fierce is slow perhaps too when arrives the avenging hour repentant prayers may calm heavens angry power nor always in the worlds vast book we find to equal sin an equal doom assigned here see with honors crowned therewhelmd with grief the indian spoiler and the english thief and mark what varying fates their plunders stop who robbed a nation and who robbed a shop rascals alike by fortunes wayward sport one goes to tyburn the other goes to court and while this rogue is doomed in air to swing that for a peerage kneels to thank the king the sophists fears thus calmed the legal war no more he dreads but dauntless seeks the bar arrives before you wonders why you stay and cries  sure conscience makes the wretch delay caught by his tranquil air and front of brass often does for innocence assurance pass the judge declares your charge must groundless be its malice blames and sets the prisoner free while you with fiercer rage assert your cause and term the judge corrupt unjust the laws than sappho felt when drury damned her work or gallias struggles raised in zealous burke yet now emilius let my prayers assuage awhile this flood of grief this storm of rage nor scorn my counsel though from one it flows whose life few years whose brain small judgment knows your lack of temper suits my lack of wit and boyish griefs with boyish counsels fit when amputation risques a patients life some skilful hand should guide the surgeons knife but who to bleed him farquhar need retain when the next barbers boy could breathe the vein mark then  if what you mourn were some dire ill no partner suffered and no time could still if some strange curse some plague to nature new on you had fallen and fallen on none but you no word of mine should mock your published pain or strive to bind your wrath in reasons chain who knows the human heart must also know how keen the pangs which make your sorrows flow not with those sighs which heave the nephews heart who sees his hoarding uncles life depart not with those tears which custom bids be shed by youthful widows for old husbands dead grieve they who dear departing wealth behold and mourn not loss of friends but loss of gold no forced affliction bids their sorrows rise they need no onion to provoke their eyes no  lost that idol most adored and dear heartfelt despair wild rage and grief sincere burst in each bitter sigh gush in each scalding tear yet sure my friend it is wrong unusual rage to feel at crimes so usual in this age unless your lot by fate you hoped designed free from all crosses common to mankind alas ere beat your breast ere rent your hair weigh what you bear yourself what others bear no pangs are yours past mans past heavens relief no mighty mischiefs move this mighty grief search but the world then own your wrongs how small placed near those wrongs on other heads which fall must i attest the fact to prove how vice reigns sovereign here one house can well suffice to bowstreet turn the lines from the    th to the   0th are by the hon william lamb  ye giddy gay and proud who swell great londons everbustling crowd london where all extremes together meet follys chief throne and wisdoms gravest seat where disagreements in agreement lie our closeknit mass of contrariety where throng the rich and poor the fool and knave where statesmen juggle and where patriots rave where balls for advocates prepare their work and embryo lawsuits in a whisper lurk where cupid pays in specie for his wiles and judges frown whenever a lady smiles where equal farce continual sport affords at covent garden or the house of lords where beggars with feigned tears and ready smiles cringe to st james or blubber to st giles ye who confusedly sail in motley trim down this full flood of pleasure business whim whether you frame smooth glib and specious lies to cheat a tradesman or to raise supplies with private or with public misery sport cheats upon change or parasites at court now pause awhile  for one reflecting hour forego your hopes of gain your dreams of power and hark while tells the muse what monstrous crimes what newfound sins reserved for our strange times their hideous forms to addington betray from morns first languish to the death of day here mark the thankless child the unnatural sire the pandar slave who lets his spouse for hire the adulterous friend the trusted wanton wife the brother aiming at the brothers life the rake who cools in beautys arms his heat then lets her starve or ply for bread the street and that dark train of foes to moral rules thieves bawds assassins gamblers knaves and fools fools who would fain be knaves no more i will write hence odious forms nor longer shock my sight else by disgust and scorn to madness driven bursting those chains which bind my soul to heaven i shall disdain to breathe such tainted air shall blush an human form like these to wear for present ease shall barter future bliss and sure no world can be more black than this deep in my swelling heart shall plunge the knife and cry while flies my soul from mortal strife heaven bless my father though he gave me life cease wild enthusiast end thy angry tale over human frailties drop compassions veil view them with grief not rage nor dare to scan with censure too severe thy fellowman think had no parent watched thy pliant youth curbed thy wild passions turned thy steps to truth and taught thee by her radiant light to know that bliss is virtue and that guilt is woe spurning restraint and scorned each sacred vow happily thyself had been what these are now these who by headstrong passions forced away or pressing want or strong examples sway strangers to love of man or fear of god but trod perhaps those paths their parents trod while ignorance led them to that whirlpools brink where long they struggled and where now they sink oh view their lot my soul nor more repine to bear those evils fate has fixed on mine content though many a grief my bosom wrings if still that bosom owns no conscious stings if still i know for others wounds to feel with pity view them and with pleasure heal and still those pangs which cause so keen a smart nor sour my temper nor deprave my heart yes though by fate with heaviest sorrows cursed from my pale lips no murmuring breath should burst if still my hand had power to raise the oppressed and though unblest myself make others blessed that power emilius still is yours  then why thus pants your bosom and thus flames your eye your gold though lost  emiliusnay it is not gold which makes this fury tear me but my bile it shakes that still my lawful suit in vain i urge and still yon caitiff mocks the avenging scourge could i but once his wellearnd sufferings see  the author and would his sufferings then bring wealth to thee would with his blood gold to thy coffers run or all his groans repay thee one pound one  emilius not so but vengeance  the authorhush  to mention fear what thou must shame to speak i shame to hear base minds alone delight in vengeance find that low vile passion of a low vile mind oh think when summoned to the throne of heaven as thou forgavst so thou shall be forgiven and think what pangs would rack each throbbing nerve if god should judge us as our faults deserve say at this moment should the perjured wretch stung with remorse his hands imploring stretch toward thee for pardon while with tears and groans thy foot he kisses and his guilt he owns should that foot spurn him would thou frown and cry back sinner to the flames thou fain would fly twere nobler far thy thirst of vengeance over to bid the sinner rise and sin no more twere nobler far to play the christians part aid struggling conscience to secure his heart confirm his faith with hope inspire his breast and make him virtuous now hereafter blessed then when thou diedst the transport thine would be proudly to boast  god owes a soul to me but if revenge alone can please you know even now though law was blind though justice slow more pangs he feels his heart by conscience rent than you could name or mortal brain invent true from his lips no plaints inform the crowd what pains are his  deep are his groans not loud curses not loud but deep macbeth  true from his eyes no streams of anguish roll his burning tears fall inwards on his soul there brood thy vipers conscious guilt and dart with ceaseless spite their fangs into his heart there prints with bloodless stroke thy silent steel wounds that no balm can ease no time can heal not all the pangs which dantes visions swell no freezing limbo and no fiery hell surpass his torments who still bears unblest a selfaccuser in his own sad breast disgust and ceaseless care and anxious fear still share his bed and at his board appear in vain his cooks their various arts combine each dish to season and each sauce refine champagnes rich grape in vain to cheer his soul with brilliant bubbles fills his crystal bowl the harpy conscience pounces on her prey at subitae horrisico lapsu de montibus adsunt harpyiae and magnis quatiunt clangoribus alas deripiuntque dapes contactuque omnia foedant immundo aeneid book iii  tears from his hand the untasted food away and ere the wine his pallid lips can pass her gallfraught tongue drops poison in his glass next mark my friend his slumbers  if repose lists to his suit and bids his eyelids close mark what convulsions heave his martyred breast and frequent starts and heartdrawn sighs attest though nature grants him sleep that guilt denies him rest now groans of tortured ghosts his ear affright now ghastly phantoms dance before his sight and now he sees and screams in frantic fear to size gigantic swelled thy angry shade appear swift at thy summons rush with hideous yell their prey to seize the denizens of hell headlong they hurl him on some icerocks point mangle each limb and dislocate each joint or plunge him deep in blue sulphurous lakes or lash his quivering flesh with twisted snakes or in his brain their burning talons dart or from his bosom rend his panting heart to bathe their fiery lips in guilty gore  then starts he from his couch while dews of horror pour down his dank forehead  wrings his hands and prays to sleep no more hark the stormdaemon shrieks  it thunders  lo how pale his cheeks how wild his eye balls grow heard the first murmur while he waits the crash and dreads to see the etherial meteors flash no shock of clouds he thinks no casual hand rolls the red bolt or darts the avenging brand it is heavens own voice in thunder bids him die and it is to blast him yon blue lightnings fly his fears were vain the storm disperses  true but who can answer what the next may do though now sweet nature sleeps and skies are fair soon gathering clouds again may gloom the air soon shafts divine winged by celestial breath again may glare and the next shaft brings death with ceaseless fears and conscious pangs oppressed by day by night unknown one hour of rest wasted his limbs his strength and spirits fled disease now chains him on her thorny bed the couch in crowds though galens sons surround his dire complaints deride their skill profound no medicine brings relief no pang is eased for who can medicine to a mind diseased can thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the foul spirit of that perilous stuff that weighs upon the heart macbeth  heavens lord alone  and shall i dare invoke with prayers that power whose holiest law i broke in heaven still fresh my violated vow will angels heed my forced repentance now hence idle thought no prayers can now obtain aid from insulted heaven and mans is vain thus cries the wretch distraction in his eye hopeless to live yet unprepared to die by fear his soul by pain his body vexed by conscience tortured and by doubt perplexed loathing this world and shuddering at the next yet though his old offense thus brands with shame his conscious forehead and unmans his frame when some new sin excites his impious zeal his heart is adamant his nerves are steel nor think your perjured friend reformed by time will bound his forfeits to this single crime the rose of innocence once rent away no more shall grace his brow and who can say one step and then no further  this first sin crowned with success ere long his feet shall win to loftier heights of vice and urge his fate from bad to worse from little crimes to great till his broad guilt for public vengeance calls and to the laws his life a victim falls then shall thou own and blush at thy mistrust crimes still are punished and god still is just here break we off  speed thou to lombard street or plod the gambling change with busy feet midst bulls and bears some false report to spread of prussia armed or buonaparte dead from specious lies an honest gain to draw and spoil some wretch in forms allowed by law more dupes to find more knavish tricks to learn and fooled thyself fool others in thy turn while i sequestered in some favorite nook or guide the pencil or explore the book blessed if still free from mad ambitions dreams youths vain rash hopes and interests fordid schemes i sometimes hear to cheer my lonely hours the muse awake her lutes harmonious powers and still can boast when down lifes vale i bend my steps nor grieved nor glad my days to end a feeling heart an open hand content and one true friend  finis
