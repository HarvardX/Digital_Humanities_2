an essay on the nature and cure of the so called wormfever  by samuel musgrave m d fellow of the royal society  and corresponding member of the academy of belles lettres at paris  london printed and sold by t pain b white j robson and p elmsly  mdcclxxvi  of the wormfever the wormfever as it is called being a disorder to which children are pretty generally liable and frequently eluding the skill of the physician it will not i presume be unacceptable to the public if i lay before them a method of treating that disorder which in several instances of my own practice has been attended with success and which from the immediate relief it gives the patients i conclude to be specifically adapted to the cure of it and not successful by accident only  the difficulty of curing what is called a wormfever arises in my opinion from its being frequently attributed to worms when the cause of the disorder is of a quite different nature i do not mean to deny that worms do sometimes abound in the human body nor that the irritation caused by them does sometimes produce a fever but i apprehend these cases to be much more uncommon than it is generally imagined and that great mischief is done by treating some of the disorders of children as wormcases which really are not so  that practitioners are frequently deceived in this respect is sufficiently ascertained by the testimony of dr hunter who assures me that he has dissected great numbers of children who have been supposed to die of wormfevers and whose complaints were of course treated as proceeding from worms in whom however there appeared upon dissection to be not only no worms but evident proofs of the disorder having been of a very different nature a single case of this kind was published long ago in the edinburgh medical essays by professor sinclair who after informing us that upon opening the body no worms were found goes on to observe that a disappointment of this kind is no new thing for all experienced physicians know that every symptom commonly produced by worms except voiding them sometimes arises from other causes if this be the case if it be no new thing for physicians to prescribe medicines against worms to patients who have none i am afraid it is no new thing also under this misapprehension to do a great deal of mischief  the cause of these mistakes is plainly this that people not only conclude too hastily from the existence of a single worm that there are many more behind but they often as dr sinclair also intimates infer the existence of worms from signs that are very equivocal and uncertain such as the stools containing sometimes a curdly matter like the curd of milk and sometimes a dark green substance apparently full of filaments like the conferva upon standing waters the urine at the same time having a mixture of something creamy with evacuations of this kind if the patient is flushed in the face starts frequently from his sleep and is much disposed to rub his nose it is concluded that though there be no worms completely formed there is yet a considerable quantity of the minera verminosa or seminium verminosum which must be carried off by repeated purges  it is observed however by practitioners that the disorder is much less obstinate and dangerous when the worms appear to be completely formed even though their number should be considerable than when there is no evacuation of complete worms but only a large quantity of what is called the seminium verminosum and yet in this last state the animal being by supposition as yet in embryo and quite invisible cannot give so much irritation to the bowels nor absorb so much of the chyle as when it is perfectly formed and active and therefore ought not upon this principle to give so much disturbance to the body that it inhabits  but further it is remarked that the supposed wormcases do every now and then cause a soreness prominency and inflammation of the navel which if it comes to suppurate the disorder speedily gives way whereas if there is no such tendency to inflammation it frequently proves fatal and is at best very tedious and difficult of cure now what connection can there be between a suppuration of the navel discharging nothing but pus and a real wormcase how comes it to pass that all the bad symptoms shall vanish as i have seen them do upon the coming on of the suppuration if they had been produced by worms lodged in the intestine and still continuing to lodge there  wherever this has been the case it seems clear that the disorder must have been only an irritation or morbid affection of the bowel from the use of some improper food which the strength of the constitution after a time throws out upon the external surface of the body producing at the same time a proportionable relief of the internal and vital part now if this be the nature of the disorder in some few cases it may not improbably have been so in many more in which the efforts of nature have been checked or to speak less metaphorically in which the power of nature has been too much weakened by injudicious and repeated purges  that purges are often found ineffectual to dislodge the worms in children is a fact acknowledged by those who most frequently use them in the supposed wormcases indeed the difficulty of those cases evidently shows it the general method of cure being by repeated purges if this however was the only inconvenience if all that purges did was to produce a little unnecessary nausea and griping the practice might be borne with but unfortunately what upon the common supposition is only useless upon the contrary and more probable supposition is pernicious and destructive where the irritation of the bowels is disposed to affect the brain the proper indication after carrying off the original offending matter is to comfort and strengthen the bowels instead of weakening them by frequent purges which effectually prevent the irritating cause from discharging itself upon the surface in children particularly whose nerves are tender and in whom all irritations are readily transmitted from the intestines and other remote parts of the body to the brain the effects of too frequently repeating them are greatly to be dreaded i have myself seen more than one instance where the evacuations intended to carry off worms from the bowels though not immoderate in quantity have been soon after followed by slight convulsions and other very threatening nervous symptoms  for this reason unless we could be certain a priori that the child we prescribe for has worms and worms too in a considerable number i must think it highly imprudent and unsafe to teaze and weaken him by purging which if there be really no worms must certainly do considerable harm to those wormmedicines that are not purgative there is not the same objection though still there is little or no benefit to be expected from them in the spurious wormfever which as i observed before is much the most common of the two  the spurious wormfever of which i come now to give an account has in all the instances i have seen arisen evidently from the children having been indulged with too great quantities of fruit though a poor cold diet of any kind may for aught i know occasionally give birth to it every sort of fruit eaten in excess will probably produce it and of course that which is to be had in the greatest plenty will from its plenty be the occasion of most mischief i am convinced however as well from my own experience as by the observations of my medical friends that a great proportion of these disorders is produced by the immoderate use of cherries which may in part be owing to a prevailing opinion of their innocence so that children are suffered even by their parents to eat freely of them without any suspicion or apprehension of danger which they are very seldom suffered to do of pears plumbs or apples  there is no part of nature so open to doubt and skepticism as medical subjects and therefore it is not to be wondered that many people should entertain a notion of the innocence of fruit to children fruit like most other substances that we know has a variety of effects upon the human body to some it is salutary and medicinal to others innocent and to a third sort prejudicial where it is even prejudicial the harm it does depends in a great measure upon the quantity and the precise quantity that will be prejudicial it is from the great varieties of constitution impossible to define people not aware of this intricacy can hardly be said to reason ill when they infer that what a great number eat with impunity is innocent to all yet further reflection would suggest to them that things the most confessedly noxious do not in every constitution produce the same effects the effluvia of the smallpox for instance will affect one man while another equally exposed to them shall escape it would therefore be a very commendable piece of discretion to pay a little more regard upon this occasion to the judgment of our forefathers who are known to have been particularly cautious in the article of fruit and attributed many of the disorders of children to a too frequent or excessive use of it and that this apprehension was not wholly unreasonable will appear i think from the following reflection we have all frequent opportunities of observing and most of us have experienced that fruit in no very large quantity will produce the colic which it could not do without being occasionally offensive and hostile to the body now whatever is offensive and capable of creating pain will by change of circumstances be capable of creating a disorder of a different kind that is a fever a diarrhoea or a stupor and oppression of the brain  the approach of this disorder has a different appearance according as it arises from a habit of eating fruit in rather too large quantities or from an excessive quantity eaten at one time in the former case the patient gradually grows weak and languid his color becomes pale and livid his belly swells and grows hard his appetite and digestion are destroyed his nights grow restless or at least his sleep is much disturbed with startings and then the fever soon follows in the progress of which the patient grows comatose and at times convulsed in which state when the event is fatal he dies the pulse at the wrist though quick is never strong or hard as indeed it very seldom is in any of the disorders of children the carotids however beat with great violence and elevate the skin so as to be distinctly seen at a distance the heat is at times considerable especially in the trunk though at other times when the brain is much oppressed it is little more than natural it is sometimes accompanied by a violent pain of the epigastric region though more commonly the pain is slight and terminates in a coma some degree of pain however seems to be inseparable from it so as clearly to distinguish this disorder from other comatose affections  where a large quantity of fruit has been eaten at once the attack of the disorder is instantaneous and its progress rapid the patient often passing in the space of a few hours from apparently perfect health to a stupid comatose and almost dying state the symptoms of the fever when formed are in both cases nearly the same except that in this latter sort i have now and then seen a little purulent matter discharged by vomit and stool from the very first day the stools in both sorts are such as i have already described that is they exhibit sometimes a kind of curd resembling curdled milk and at other times a floating substance of the color and appearance of conferva sometimes a number of little threads and pellicles and now and then a single worm  if the patient under these circumstances is too frequently or too strongly purged the complaints after a short interval of relief return with great violence the coma increases or instead of it convulsions come on where the disorder is not so severe frequent purgings will bring on flatulent shifting pains of the sides and breast and twitchings of the lips and face as soon as any thing of this kind appears it is necessary to desist immediately from purging and as to bleeding it is not to be thought of in any stage of the disease  at the beginning of the illness as the indigested matter and mucus that lies in the stomach and bowels has a tendency to keep up the morbid symptoms it may be of great use to give one vomit and one purge the vomit for a child of three or four years old to consist of a few grains of ipecacuanha or which is rather better three or four tea spoonfuls of ipecacuanha wine with ten drops of the essence of antimony the purge for the same age may be a powder of jalap and rhubarb of each four grains powder of sena leaves and fine sugar of each six grains when this has operated properly there will very seldom be any occasion for repeating it and it will be sufficient if the body is costive to throw up every second or third day the following clyster infus flor chamaemel unc v aloes caballin dram ss fiat solutio pro enemate  but the principal part of the cure depends upon external applications to the bowels and stomach which are the residence of the morbid cause and from whence the mischief spreads as from a center to the parts above and below i have already delivered my sentiments with regard to external applications that they have a real distinguished efficacy and that their action is not by absorption and circulation but directly upon the nerves as the cause of this disorder is of a cold nature the applications must be warm cordial and invigorating and their action must be promoted by constant actual heat the following is a prescription i have used

nervous symptoms should come on or remain after the disorder is abated they will soon be removed by giving a pill of four grains of asa foetida once or twice a day the benefit the children find from this makes them instead of loathing soon grow fond of it so as to call for it of their own accord if it is not brought them and sometimes prefer it to an orange or a sweetmeat  it was before observed that the diagnostics of worms are very uncertain which implies not only that they are sometimes suspected where they have no existence but on the contrary also that they sometimes exist where they are not suspected hence it becomes a very natural question whether if a real wormcase should be treated in the manner here described there would be any risque of its being increased by such treatment or of its gaining ground by loss of time my opinion upon both these questions is clearly no and that in cases where we will suppose the bowels to be really full of worms this method with some slight alterations is greatly preferable to those which are commonly used as worms either find the constitution weakly or very soon make it so the frequent repetition of purges particularly mercurials cannot but have a pernicious effect upon children bearsfoot is still more exceptionable being in truth to be ranked rather among poisons than medicines wormseed and all kinds of bitters are too offensive to the palate and stomach to be long persisted in the powder of coralline creates disgust by its quantity and the infusion of pinkroot is well known to occasion now and then vertiginous complaints and fits and though some people assert that these fits are owing to the contorsion of the worms in the bowels when the infusion is not sufficiently strong to kill or stupefy them others and particularly dr lining are of a contrary opinion and impute the bad effects of it to an overdose in this diversity of opinions who will positively undertake to say that the accident shall not happen it is commonly therefore with some reluctance that parents suffer it to be administered to their children who have on their parts on account of its sickly and earthy taste an equal aversion to taking it but fomenting the belly night and morning with a strong decoction of rue and wormwood is a remedy very easy to be administered attended with no danger and instead of weakening the bowels has an evident tendency to corroborate them which circumstance alone contributes perhaps more than any thing else to the destruction of worms the vigor of the contained or parasitical animal being overcome by the digestive powers of the viscera in which it is lodged after the fomentation it may be of use to anoint the belly with a liniment composed of one part essential oil of rue with two parts of a decoction of rue in sweet oil forestus in his observations lib xxi    mentions a remarkable cure effected by an ointment in which the gall of a bull the text has it fell auri was a principal ingredient where the decoction or essential oil of rue are not readily to be procured an ointment strongly impregnated with this or oxs gall would i suppose be very efficacious of internal medicines the best is asa foetida with an aloetic pill or two at proper intervals  the diet of children disposed to worms should be warm and nourishing consisting in part at least of animal food which is not the worse for being a little seasoned their drink may be any kind of beer that is well hopped with now and then a small draught of porter or negus a total abstinence from butter is perhaps not so necessary as the generality of the world imagine hungry poor cheese must by all means be avoided but rich pungent cheese in a moderate quantity is particularly serviceable in the spurious wormfever the patient should be supported occasionally by small quantities of broth and at the close of it when the appetite returns the first food given should be of the kinds above recommended though in a very small quantity as the patient grows stronger the quantity may be increased taking care if possible to avoid indigestion or if it arises correcting it with the following powder rhubarb pulv magnes alb aa gr v spec aromat gr ij misce  the diet here directed will perhaps be thought extraordinary as the general idea is at present that in the management of children nothing is so much to be avoided as repletion and rich food it is no doubt an error to feed children too well or to indulge them with wine and rich sauces but it is equally an error to confine them to too strict or too poor a diet which weakens their digestion and renders them much more subject to disorders of every kind but particularly to disorders of the bowels in regard to the spurious wormfever if it be true that acid fruits too plentifully eaten are the general cause of it it follows as a consequence that a warm nutritious diet moderately used will most effectually counteract the mischief and soonest restore the natural powers of the stomach besides if the disorder does not readily yield to the methods here directed as there are many examples and some within my own experience of its terminating by an inflammation and suppuration of the navel it is highly advisable to keep this probability in view and by a moderate allowance of animal food to support those powers of nature from which only such a happy crisis is to be expected
