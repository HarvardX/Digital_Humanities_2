vertiginous  what other litteral faults may have escaped correction the reader is desired to amend  the preface the kind reception this book has met with from the public appears by nothing more than the quick sale of the former editions there have not been many physic books in respect to the large number that have been published of which three thousand copies have in so short a time been disposed of but its having been well received and so much called for since out of print is not the only motive of reprinting it the great good the medicines prescribed in it have done and daily do to abundance of people afflicted with diseases of the head brain and nerves as also to those oppressed with melancholy and vapors is another of much greater weight for it being reasonable to believe there are many hundreds of persons troubled with those diseases who have not yet seen it and who by reading it may meet with their cure as vast numbers have already done i thought my self for their sakes as well as my own advantage obliged to send it again to the press and upon looking it over carefully with that intention i did not find occasion for any very material additions and therefore omitted some of slight consequence i might have made purely because those who have bought the other editions might not think themselves imposed upon or be obliged to buy this fourth which for that reasonis sent into the world again exactly as before some very few corrections excepted  of all the diseases incident to mankind there are none more dangerous and mortal than those of the head and brain and this my experience in the cure of those diseases has convinced me of though i must do my self justice in declaring that i have had as few patients miscarryed considering the number i have in my time atended as perhaps any physician before me and have ured some who have been so very bad through delay or improper medicines that there was scarce a probability of restoring the melancholy circumstances of persons so afflicted is matter of great concern because we daily find ignorant men who would be thought doctors tampering in those diseases as if there were no danger in them at all but this in our days is but what was in the days of our predecessors though more now than then the art of physic being surely never more abused than at this time and that because there is no punishment inflicted on them besides reproach which they so little care for that from their wonted assurance they nothing less than laugh at  the mature consideration of this and the mischiefs i my self have seen in my practice by insignificant or improper medicines and management together with the success i have had in many desperate diseases of the head first put me upon writing this treatise this fourth edition of which i am in hopes will be as kindly accepted by those so afflicted as i am sure they will upon trial find the methods and medicines directed to answer what is said of them  the title page tells you it is a treatise of diseases of the head brain and nerves and so it is but as the eyes nose tongue teeth gums jaws and palate go to the making up of the head the reader may expect perhaps i have treated of them also which he will not find done and that because it was no way material here any further than that in chapter the   th where i speak of catarrhs or defluxions i have shown how those humors affect those parts and that many times by the removing those humors those parts are relieved  to this treatise of diseases of the head i have subjoined a discourse on melancholy and vapors which though they are not properly head diseases yet bear such analogy to them or at least so far affect either the head brain nerves or all that they come properly enough to be considered here and i persuade my self the account given of them will not fall very short of any performance of the like nature at leastwise as to the main thing i mean the curative part which however will be better understood upon the patients experience than by any thing i can say  i had put my name and place of habitation to this book but that i foresaw it might not be so well as let alone in this censorious age therefore resolved against it not that i have any reason i thank god to conceal my self or need be ashamed either of one or the other but to supply that want i have taken care to make what i have written the more plain and intelligible having in each disease not only prescribed what methods are to be observed and medicines i have found useful to many but also directed at the end of the book where those peculiar ones i have prescribed in it and always found to stand me in stead on the most urgent occasions are to be had i me an by those who do not understand how or care not to take the trouble of preparing them themselves which by being taken and used at the book directs will by the help of god work a perfect cure and the patients have no occasion to trouble either themselves or me for any further advice or direction  this i thought good to hint with an assurance that what is written about the several distempers is what the patients afflicted too truly find and also that the remedies for cure are well adapted replete with power to effect what is said of them and which i have the vanity to believe the patient will in some measure give credit to upon the bear reading what he will find written though i am not so weak as to expect anything that is or can be said of them will or can convince him like his making trial of them himself my encomiums on em falling far short of what his own experiencing will prove they deserve therefore the reader is desired to suspend his opinion of the book and medicines till he has read the former and tried the latter whatever he judges of the author who conceives let what will be said or thought of him by the method he has taken to serve the public and himself if matters not if what is said and recommended in the book answer but the

treatise of diseases of the head brain and nerves chap i of the headache there are two sorts of headache the recent or new and inveterate or old headache the former lasts but for a time only and is either from cold hard drinking heat of the sun violent exercise or the like and goes away as those occasions wear off the other is constant or lasting with very little abatement or intermission is hard to be eased and which on light occasions has extreme sharp fits so that the patient cannot endure any noise or vehement motion or scarce any light but desires to lie in the dark and be still for noise if it be great renders him almost crazed but though as in some the inveterate or old headache continues always more or less in others it goes away and returns by fits  they are both understood by the same common name of the heachach but are vastly different as to cure the first going away upon the occasion ceasing as i have already said the other being of long standing is inveterate and with difficulty removed it being caused either through much blood disorder of the stomach or sharp humors contained within or without the skull inflaming the head and depraving the sense if the pain be attended with heaviness it comes of plenitude if with pricking and shooting it proceeds from sharp choleric humors if the head seems distended without heaviness and beating wind is the cause but if with beating there is inflammation in the films of the brain if there be a heaviness with distention it shows plenitude of humors within the films if the pain be outward it is in the films that cover the scull but if inward and at the roots of the eyes the films that cover the brain are grieved the external pain is in the pericranium or the membrane without the scull and comes for the most part from external cold because a cold part will easily suffer from the like quality the internal pain is always in the meninges or internal membranes  but as the headache inveterate or old proceeds chiefly from inward causes either from some fault in the head it self or disorder of the stomach i shall speak only of that the recent headache as already said going away of it self upon a little rest and regularity without any medicines  if the pain proceeds from the head essentially there will be no intermission but a continual pain or if the pain does remit it is but for a little time and returns again  if it proceeds from the stomach the pain will often cease and return again also the appetite will decay especially if the stomach abounds much with phlegm but if the stomach abounds much with choler there will be a bitterness in the mouth a gnawing pain of the stomach a nausea or loathing of food trembling of the heart and inflammation which are much increased after sleep  if the headache proceeds from the head essentially i always give my following cephalic purging pills which never fail moving off those humors that infest the brain and its meninges whereby the patient has instant ease  but when the headache proceeds from the stomach i ever give my emetick powder presently to be prescribed which gently and safely yet thorough ly evacuates the offending cause and sets the patient to rights more especially if in each case my cephalic elixir prepared as follows on the intermediate days be also taken  my cephalic purging pills are thus prepared take of the best turkey rhubarb half an ounce troches of agarick an ounce citron myrabolans two drams euphorbium two scruples rushia castor half an ounce turbith root the most gummy jallop root and harmodacts of each an ounce indian spickenard a dram the best english saffron two drams ginger cummin seed of each a dram flowers of rosemary an handful bruise them all small and affuse thereon in a glass cucurbit a quart of compound pyony water doubly distilled close up the mouth of the glass that nothing may evaporate and set it in a sand heat for six days to digest then let it cool and when it is quite cold press out the liquor very strongly in a press and to the liquor put of the best succotrina aloes two ounces scammony two ounces coloquintida two ounces mastich half an ounce all in fine powder shake them together very well in the same cucurbit the liquor came out of it being first washed very clean from the former ingredients and dry set it in the sand heat again with the mouth open but let the heat be greater than before that it may evaporate to the consistency of an extract to which when cold add of the best salt of amber an ounce camphir rubbed fine half an ounce flowers of antimony an ounce the volatile salts of hartshorn and armoniack of each six drams chemical oils of rosemary nutmegs amber and lavender of each a dram mix all together very well and keep it for use three pills of this mass about the bigness of a large white pea each are sufficient for one dose  my emetick powder is thus made take the finest purified salt peter six drams salt of tartar two drams the best hungarian antimony five drams powder them all apart very fine and mix them well together then put the mixture by little and little at a time into a crucible set in a charcoal fire and made red hot let the mixture remain therein till it is melted and flows like water then take the crucible from the fire and there will be at the bottom of it a mass which when it is cold will be hard and reddish take it ut of the crucible and powder it very fine and put it unto a digesting glass and pour upon it as much spirit f rosemary nutmegs and lavender equal parts of ach as will cover it three fingers set it in a sand heat close covered for twenty days or so long as till all the spirit being soaked up by the powder seems dried away and the powder looks greyish then take it out and rub it aain in a glass mortar very fine and add to every dram f it sixty three grains of fine salt peter subtily poudered mix them well together and keep the powder in a glass close stopped for use twenty grains of it is a dose for a grown person  my cephalic elixir thus take flowers of rosemary cammomile and lavender of each half a pound sage twelve ounces let them be all well dried and finely poudered by grinding them in an hot iron mortar with four ounces of highly alcind salt of tartar put them into a digesting glass and add of a mans scull that came by a violent death rasped four ounces vitriol calcined till it is yellow half a pound misletoe of the oak three ounes roots of zedoary angelico and valerian of each two ounces orange peel two ounces cubebs cardamoms spickenard cloves nutmegs of each an ounce camphir an ounce and half compound pyony water doubly distilled as much as will overtop the ingredients ix fingers close the digesting glass with all in it and set it in horse dung for a month then take it out and when it is cold press out the liquor from the ingredients till they are dry and fit for nothing in the liuor dissolve the finest salt of amber four ounces and elixirate it according to art forty or fifty drops of it is a dose  by the signs before given any one that is afflicted with the headache may distinguish and know his case and accordingly with the medicines prescribed may have his cure they having been long experienced by the author to be the most effectual in those cases the pills are to be taken three at a time over night which will the next morning give four five or six easy stools warm water gruel broth posset drink or tea are liquors proper to be drank as they operate and the patient keeping a little warm the days he takes them will be the better they may be repeated twice or thrice in a week as there is occasion as also must be the emetick powder which is to be taken by those whose stomachs being foul etc are the cause of the headache but as the pills are to be taken at night the powder is to be taken in a morning in a spoonful of water gruel with the same observation and care as directed for the purging pills  and on the intermediate days of taking either the cephalic pills or emetick powder it is necessary for the patient to take the cephalic elixir forty or fifty drops at a time every night and morning in a glass of wine ale beer tea coffee or what other liquor pleases best which together with the pills or powder will have wonderful effects in altering and regulating those humors that create the disorder and pain in the head  a gentleman about forty five years of age was almost from his minority grievously afflicted with the headache which unfitted him for all business he had taken many medicines used bleeding cupping issues blisters etc which but little more than palliated or for a while eased his pains at length i being sent to with an account of his case ordered my cephalic pills and elixir abovementioned to be given him which greatly relieved him but he complaining also of his stomach and want of appetite i ordered him likewise my emetick powder just now prescribed to be taken alternately with the pills by which he found a sensible mitigation of his pain and at length a total cessation of it that he was perfectly cured  a young lady of one and twenty years of age the only daughter of a worthy gentleman had been afflicted with a violent pain of the head from a child which she was seldom or never free from and when it was at the worst would cause vomiting her parents had tried almost every body some ascribed the cause to one thing others to others at last some body that had heard of the success of my medicines for the head recommended them and my opinion was accordingly desired i ordered her my emetick powder and cephalic elixir the last to be taken in an infusion of sage marjoram rosemary mint and virginia snake root made like tea which she willingly took though the snake root made it very bitter and strong and by continuing them for above two months she was perfectly restored and is since married which her parents by means of her indisposition ever before dispaird of i could give diverse other instances but as i design brevity in this treatise must be obliged to forbear  chap ii of the megrim the megrim is a vehement pain in one half of the head either on the right or left side thereof afflicting either the teguments without the scull or the meninges of the brain within agreeing in quality and coming near the nature of the old headache spoken of in the foregoing chapter if it be without the scull the part pained is most commonly so sore that the patient can hardly bear its being touched if it be within the scull that soreness is wanting and the pain is the more vehement sometimes the pain is more toward the occiput or hinder part of the head and sometimes more toward the sinciput or fore part of the head or near the root of the eye on that side which is pained if it be accidental it never afflicts the patient but upon extraordinary occasions but if it be habitual it returns either at set periods of time or keeps an uncertain irregular course being excited without any apparent cause continuing long and with that vehemence that the patient thinks it will distract him  from these signs it appears that as the megrim is from like causes of the headache spoken of in the last chapter so the cure is to be attempted and though many authors have prescribed many medicines both for one and the other yet they allow they are to be remedied if such a thing be to be done with the same medicines which i also have experienced and the best to do it that ever i met with are what i have recommended in the former chapter and which if the patient keeps to i mean both pills powder and elixir the former to be taken as mentioned alternarely that is one time the pills the next time the powder and so on and the elixir the days on which neither the pills or powder are taken will undoubtedly free the patient therefrom if it be in the power of medicine to do it i have performed the cure by them in several and particularly in a gentlewoman who about the time her monthly visits left her was so afflicted with the megrim sometimes of one side of the head at other times on the other that she had very little ease night or day she relating her case to me i gave her both my pills powder and elixir which in five weeks carried off her pain perfectly so that she was and is as free from it as ever in her life though it is many months since  chap iii of the vertigo giddiness or swimming of the head the vertigo giddiness or swimming of the head is a disease in the cavities of the brain causing the patient to think all things turn round and many times causes him to stagger and reel and sometimes to fall down the brain and senses being disturbed but often times without any pain by a preternatural exagitation and commotion yet depriving not the patient of either sense or motion  this disease is twofold one simple wherein the sight remains unhurt the other complex wherein the sight is darkened as it were with a mist or cloud and is called scotoma  the signs by which the vertigo is known is by what has been said only when the disease is recent or but gentle the patient seldom falls but staggers as it were a little and is confounded in his mind by a certain kind of amazement from the sudden exagitation of the animal spirits so that if he be walking he knows not where he is but must be forced to stand still to consult the place of his present station whither he is going and what is the occasion because a strange kind of forgetfulness seizes him notwithstanding all this while his internal senses are not so disturbed but that he knows he is about business though the particulars be forgotten which after a little pause he recollects again and becomes perfectly well  sometimes as already said this affect is accompanied with dimness and darkness of the sight representing variety of colors and things to look double and treble in which case not only all the other symptoms are existent but the circumvolution or rotation of things seem to be with a great violence or vehemence insomuch that when the paroxysm seizes the patient he will necessarily fall unless he catches hold of something to support himself  this disease happens chiefly in winter and to people that are fasting and is of very dangerous consequence if not in time remedied for it comes from blood and humors in the brain but chiefly from cold humors and flatulent vapors arising from the stomach or other inferior parts causing a continual pain in the head noise in the ears dullness of the senses loss of smelling and sometimes of tasting and if it comes by consent of the stomach then there follows a gnawing pain of the stomach trembling and sometimes vomiting with a bad digestion  when the vertigo has been of long standing it generally terminates in a scotoma and too quickly then changes into pernicious diseases as the falling sickness and apoplexy if it happens to old people it is the more dangerous because of the weakness of their brain smallness of their heat and their abounding much with phlegm if in any that have this disease things appear to their eyes bloody and reddish it foretells madness if purple color the falling sickness especially such as have the scotoma or dark vertigo sometimes the cause of a vertigo has been from a bladder of water contained in one of the ventricles of the brain cast off from the vitiated blood thither and is seldom if ever curable though the patient at the same time eats drinks and digests well i never knew one cured when it had been so but have been an eye witness to those that have dyed thereof and one particular man of seventy odd years of age who was dissected who though he was troubled with a vertigo was otherwise constantly in perfect health at first the fits came upon him but two or three times a year afterward they came once a month and as he grew older and older the disease grew stronger and stronger and the paroxysms more frequent and of longer continuance till at length he had a fit once a week the last fit he had he complained that all things turned round violently and although he leaned upon a table called out vehemently for some body to hold him for else he should fall by the hasty turning round of things he desired to go to bed forthwith which he did and whilst he lay still he seemed to be somewhat pacified but upon the least turning of his head or any part of his body he cried out that the bed and house would be turned topsy turvy and all this while he had no convulsion frenzy or madness or the least appearance of a fever except about four or five hours before his death as i said before when this mans head was opened there was found a bladder of water about the bigness of a pigeons egg lying in the foremost ventricle of the brain which alone was the cause of his death the cure of a vertigo if it be simple is not very difficult it being to be done most commonly by medicines that discuss the flatulent spirits which trouble the ventricles of the brain or that still and quiet the too great emanations of the animal spirits and that comfort and strengthen the brain that is hurt or weakened by the said flatulency and irregularities of the spirits the first is performed by heating cephalicks inwardly and outwardly which have power to discuss any ventosity lodged in the cortex of the brain the second by medicines that delight comfort refresh and strengthen the brain  authors innumerate medicines for both purposes and those of amber nutmegs rosemary sage oranges lemons ambergreese musk peacocks dung and the like but the best thing that ever i knew to be universally successful is my vertiginous spirit following of which fifty drops being taken every night and morning in a dish of green tea or which is better in tea made of rosemary lavender carraway seeds sage juniper berries and sweet majoram will have incredible effect more especially if a few drops of the spirit be snuffd up the nostrils twice or thrice a day and the forehead temples top of the head and nape of the neck be bathed with it by which means the windy vapors will be dissipated the brain comforted strengthened and fortified much more than by any other medicine that i know of whatever only now and then it may be proper for the patient the better to carry off the offending cause to take a dose of the cephalic purging pills prescribed in the first chapter or rather if he finds any disorder of the stomach to supply their place with the emetick powder therein also prescribed  the vertiginous spirit is this take beat roots two ounces marjoram la vender rosemary time betony wild time sage of each two handfuls orange and lemon peel of each an ounce and half coriander anise carraway and fennel seeds of each an ounce nutmegs two ounces cloves and mace of each six drams ginger half an ounce best rushia castor half an ounce species diatrion pipereon and species aromaticum rosatum of each an ounce salt of tartar six drams bruise small what is to be bruised and put all into a retort then pour upon them two quarts of the highest rectified spirit of wine fit a receiver to the retort which lute well together and set it in a sand heat for eight days then distili drawing off all the spirit that the ingredients may remain dry then take out the fire and when all is cold which will be in a day or two unlute the receiver and pour out the spirit in which dissolve four ounces of camphir and an ounce of salt of amber and it is done keep it always very close stopped for use dose fifty drops  being importuned by a gentleman afflicted with a vertigo to do what i could for him though he almost despaired of being cured as indeed i did of curing him by reason he had tried almost all things before and was therefore loath to undertake him but i say he greatly importuning me i gave him a bottle of my aforesaid vertiginous spirit with directions to take fifty drops in the tea just now mentioned which he did as also snuffed by my order some of it up his nostrils and bathed his head temples etc with the same by which means he was somewhat relieved but complaining of sickness at his stomach at which time his vertigo was worse i gave him four papers of my emetick powder with orders he should take one every third morning and go on with the spirit as before which he did accordingly and found such benefit that it is scarcely credible to relate he becoming thereupon as it were a new man and able to be about his business never having any the least sign of it after taking the medicines about five weeks and still continues in perfect health it being now more than two years since  chap iv of forgetfulness or dotage forgetfulness is a disease proceeding from malign vapors or an over hot or over cold and moist temperament of the brain which renders the animal spirits either too volatile that the thoughts are not to be contracted or else too torpid diminishing the natural heat that the person is dull sluggish has no memory and can think of nothing as he should  the causes of those malign vapors or over hot or cold and moist temperament of the brain are either natural or preternatural if they proceed from natural causes as sometimes they do from an ill conformity of the head and brain or over great thickness of the same or from too strait or wide passages by which the spirits are either too much compressed or dilated they are scarcely to be remedied but if the causes be from polson taken or too many narcotick medicines or from over watchings too much care bad air sickness or the like they may in time be remedied but if from falls or blows that the brain is concussed and the animal spirits dissipated or spent are incurable for in youth they breed folly and in people of years dotage  but dotage does not happen altogether to old people neither for as it is a depravation of the fancy and rational faculty arising from an irregular phantasm of the brain by a fault of the animal spirits which are clouded darkened made black thick and opacous young people may be liable to it as well as old the signs of dotage in the beginning of the distemper are perceived by the patients being much more talkative than usual especially those that are of few words when they are well and in those that used to be very taltative when well it is perceived by their sitting very mute taking no notice of any thing and as it were thinking intentively on something though when asked can give no account of what in the height of dotage in a mild tempered person there is fierce ness ribaldry and scurrilous language the motion of the eyes quick they being affected by conent of the brain arteries veins and nerves the pulse irregular and swift with a perturbation in the hypochondria the speech and actions at the same time being altogether unaccountable incongruous and foolish the patient being apt to be busied about toys and trifles if not downright folly which shows the principal faculties of the mind are extremely depraved  these diseases are commonly without any danger attending as to life but if they happen to children very young they oftentimes make the child a fool but taken in time are to be cured and so are they many times in people of years but not always as shown before i have known when they have been taken in time that a proper vomit and a volatile specific has roused up natures force that the patient has recovered and found his spirits more vigete lively and his memory quicker than at any time before and that by taking my emetick powder prescribed in chapter first and my vertiginous spirit in chapter the third and that in the particular case following  a gentleman of a brisk and airy temper quick wit and ingenuity and of an excellent apprehension judgment and memory fell first into forgetfulness and loss of memory and after into a dotage upon some trouble of mind insomuch that he would talk very foolishly ask the same question over and over and would sometimes without any cause fall a laughing at other times crying just like a child which showed that his intellectuals were really much depraved insomuch that i greatly questioned whether i could do him any service however upon his friends earnest desire i would try i sent him three papers of my emetick powder and a bottle of my vertiginous spirit with directions for his taking one of the papers every other morning and fifty drops of the spirit every morning besides and also every day about four in the afternoon and at night mixed in a glass of the tea prepared with rosemary lavender carraway seeds etc mentioned in the last chapter and to use the spirit also outwardly as therein directed which was accordingly done and by that time the three papers of powder which always vomited him well i enlarging the dose a little were taken and also the bottle of vertiginous spirit taken and used he grew better his memory being sounder and discourses more rational i therefore ordered he should persist in the same course which he did for three months together or more and grew well returning to his perfect and sound mind and memory and never had any thing more of it afterward  chap v of frenzy and madness the frenzy though it be not a perfect madness yet as it is caused from an inflammation of the membranes of the brain which hurts the internal senses as the imagination judgment etc may be said to be a sort of madness and the more as there attends those afflicted a kind of fury little and troublesome sleep speaking without sense pulling as though it were straws or the like from the bedcloaths being unruly angry raging and the like and which if not timely remedied terminates in down right madness but as it is what is curable there is no danger provided proper applications be made and the first thing that is to be done is to bleed and after that to give vomits and cephalicks than which nothing can exceed my emetick powder for vomiting and cephalic elixir for the other intentions both prescribed in chapter the first they doing all as it were at once i mean without any other medicine if the powder be repeated twice or thrice in a week in a morning and the elixir taken as therein directed but where there is a perfect madness and distraction other methods must be taken as cupping with scarifications large bleedings glysters blisters hypnoticks frequent purging and vomiting to do which two last nothing i say can be more prevalent than my cephalic pills and emetick powder given alternately as often as the patients strength can bear them  i know there are many who pretend to cure madness by some particular methods others by such and such a peculiar specific but with what success they know best one came to me once in behalf of a friend of here is a man that had been distracted for many years and had been in madhouses and other places for cure but to no purpose i told the messenger the best medicines i knew for cure were my emetick powder and cephalic purging pills some of both which i gave her with directions to give him one paper of the emetick powder one day and resting the next day to give four of the purging pills the day following and so every other day the powder or pills which was done and the patient was much better but coming for more the messenger told me they were advised to give him the following drink as one of the most certain specificks for madness m the world i answered i could not tell what extraordinary virtues were in it but they might give it notwithstanding his taking my powder and pills which they did and the man was soon after perfectly restored to his right mind but when i heard it i questioned whether that medicine or mine had most contributed to his recovery which they could not tell nor indeed i only as he was amended by my medicines before he took the drink i had reason to think well of them however that the public may be the better for knowing it if there be any thing of what is said in it i here give the prescription just as they related it to me  take dodder of time polypody of the oak of each two ounces all the myrabolans of each three drams seeds of citrons half an ounce cloves three crams black hellebore two drams leaves of sage two handfuls rosmary flowers an handful staechas flowers half an handful cut and bruise them and boil them in three quarts of spring water to two quarts strain it and give a quarter of a pint every day at four a clock in the afternoon and also at night  but as there are various sorts of madness viz discontented madness from vexations losses and crosses in the world a religious madness a madness from taking poison or poisonous things a madness from the biting of the tarantula a madness from the biting of a mad dog a love madness and a womb madness called furor vterinus to which only women are subject i say as there are eight sorts of madness this drink which i have prescribed and was so much commended as a specific for cure i fear will not have the great effect said of it though any that please may try it which was the reason of my giving the receipt of it  chap vi of the lethargy caras or sleepy diseases the lethargy is a disease known by the patients being continually sluggish and sleepy scarcely answering if often spoke to only opening their eyes and shutting them again without taking the least notice of any thing that was said to them and so inclined to sleep are they that if you shake them and rouse them ever so much they will hardly wake or at leastwise long but desire to sleep and are never satisfied without it or indeed with it so that the animal spirits are as it were bound and locked up by extraordinary obstructions there being attending a gentle fever an high pulse and breath weak the cause is from too much phlegm cooling the brain in its windings and hindmost cells which occasions the profound sleep and the putrefying humor being extremely sharp and fretting occasions the fever which is in a manner perpetual and the slowness of breath is caused from the affection of the nerves of the thorax or breast  the lethargy differs from the carus because in a carus there is no fever it differs from a catelepsis because in that the eyes when the patient sleeps are open and in the lethargy shut  all sleepy diseases if of long continuance and those happen in fat gross and old people are generally incurable and by how much deeper the sleep is or the patient the harder to wake by so much the more is the disease dangerous and that especially if it happens after the going off of an acute disease and if the sleepy disease be exquisite and the strength decays and wastes it is certainly never to be cured but if it happens to one that is young and in the heat of summer and the animal functions be not much impaired and all the natural evacuations be perfect there may be a cure to accomplish which evacuations by bleeding blistering and purging must be made the latter not by any thing better than my cephalic pills prescribed in chapter the first and then for a specific to repercuss the humor that offends and strengthen the brain i cannot advise a more prevalent preparation than my volatile essence following which discharges the animal spirits of their burden and quickens them to an immense degree the method to be observed is this first let the patient bleed in the arm twelve ounces or according as he is in age and strength after that apply a strong large blister to his neck or rather between his shoulders then the next night or next morning which he pleases let him take four of the cephalic pills which will gently purge him and every night and every morning excepting the nights and mornings he takes the pills as also about four in the afternoon let him take sixty drops of my volatile essence in a dish of tea or which is more effectual in a dish of the infusion of rosemary lavender carraway seeds etc directed in chapter the third which if followed strictly and the patients nostrils and temples be rubbed several times a day with a little of the volatile essence and a few drops of it snuffd up his nose now and then will undoubtedly by the blessing of god bring him to himself if he be curable and prevent the distemper for the future if the medicines be but for a time continued  the volatile essence is thus prepared take angelico marjoram rue rosemary and lavender flowers of each two ounces the best castor an ounce ginger pepper pellitory of spain of each half an ounce salt of tartar three drams calamus aromaticus half an ounce species pleres archonticon three drams and half euphorbium a dram rectified spirit of wine twenty ounces bruise the ingredients that are to be bruised and mix all together and digest them in a retort well luted to its receiver in balneo mariae for ten days then distill and draw of the spirit to dryness which when it is cold cohobate upon the faeces digesting and distilling as before and to the distilled spirit add spirit of salt armoniack and spirit of hartshorn both well satiated with their valatile salts of each two ounces balsam of peru an ounce oil of amber half an ounce oil of rue a dram digest them again for ten days more in which time it will have the body of an essence and be sit for use the dose is sixty drops  chap vii of the coma or unnatural watchings the coma is a great desire and inclination to sleep but with an utter inability to do it arising from narcotick vapors which infest the brain and induce the drowsy or sleepy indisposition yet at the same time so trouble and disquiet the mind that they cannot sleep at all but wink with their eyes and often open them having a doting kind of discourse attended with an inordinate motion of the hands and thighs  it is caused sometimes by a great weakness of the faculties of the body either from some grievous disease and violent pains or from immoderate evacuations which have dissipated the animal spirits unnatural watchings are when the common external sense is wearied beyond due or just measure arising from the continual uninterrupted influx of the spirits into the organs as we find when we have over tired our selves by much walking running or riding we cannot sleep though we greatly want and desire it but tumble and toss and stretch  unnatural watchings are also occasioned by too much light noise cares of the mind being too thoughtful or intent upon matters etc all which hinder sleep also pains coughs fluxes a hot distemper of the brain hot sharp and salt vapors which twitch and disturb the spirits and meninges of the brain making people uneasy and restless or from difect of such natural vapors as procure rest to the animal spirits which long abstinence from food will cause as also eating too much especially suppers  when watchings proceed from a disease and become a coma of long standing the cure is very doubtful especially if they have their speech hindered or when they breathe a murmuring noise be heard in the throat or a thin humor distills out of the nostrils or the patient not able to swallow without difficulty for in those cases it is dangerous or at least they degenerate into a lethargy or frenzy  the cure of a coma or unnatural watchings as they proceed from an humor or internal cause that interrupts the quietude of the spirits is best accomplished especially in the coma by my cephalic purging pills and cephalic elixir prescribed in chapter the first and which if taken as therein directed will carry off those offending humors that the patient will have his natural rest without taking opiates and other narcotick medicines which as they only palliate the distemper and give ease but for a while do in the end rather injure than relieve  chap viii of the apoplexy the apoplexy is a disease of the brain suddenly depriving the whole body of sense and motion riolanus defines it to be an abolition of sense and motion with respiration hurt which at last brings snorting and suffocation by reason of thick phlegm flowing out of the funnel and obstructing the larynx or windpipe which also oftentimes and unexpectedly invades all the ventricles of the brain but especially the fourth ventricle wherein unless the matter be discussed in the spinal marrow death unavoidably follows fernelius says that an apoplexy is a disease bred by an obstruction of the rete mirabile the afflux of arterial blood out of the heart into the brain being thereby intercepted willis says the sense of the word apoplexy denotes percussion and by reason of the stupendous quality of the distemper containing as it were something supernatural it is called sideration or blasting for those struck therewith are as it were planet struck or struck with an invisible power falling suddenly to the ground and being deprived both of sense and motion and the whole animal function ceasing save that they breathe they lie for a long season as if dead and sometimes yea too often are dead indeed many of which i hope to show might have been and how others may be preserved but if they revive they are many times taken with an universal palsy or else with the palsy of one side riverius says it is a most deep sleep and a total privation of sense and motion breathing excepted wherein the patient neither opens his eyes answers or feels when he is spoken to or hurt breathing also with difficulty  the apoplexy is either accidental coming of a sudden and falling indifferently upon any man though not at all predisposd thereto for which by the way no preventative method can be instituted or it is habitual from a constant disposition in some people because of which they are at first only exercised with light approaches thereof or rather symptoms afterward the paroxysms are evident but gentle but at length they become more obvious and grievous and of which at last they for the most part dye  the apoplexy is distinguished according to its degrees into gentle strong and strongest the gentle is that wherein the patient breathes freely and easily becomes sensible again the strong apoplexy is that wherein the patient breathes with very great difficulty and as it were with violence snorting and foaming at the mouth the strongest and most dangerous is that in which all sense and motion immediately cease throughout the whole body the breath also being stopped in this there is neither snorting nor foaming but the patients lie as if perfectly dead but if they do not quickly recover they ought not to be buried before three days be over it having been known that some so seized have in that space of time revived again  the signs of an apoplexy are swoonings sometimes falling suddenly and sometimes by degrees sense motion and voice being many times taken away sometimes only diminished respiration alone and that with much difficulty remaining some persons sleep deeply and as it were snort or snore the loosened limbs being lift up fall down with their own weight in the manner of dead persons and their eyes are either wide open or quite shut the pulse at the same time being strong and full which has deceived many in the prognostics of this disease in many there is a relaxation of the sphincter muscles of the anus and bladder so that the excrements and urine come away involuntarily and insensibly  an apoplexy very seldom gives any warning of its approach unless in persons subject to lethargies or vertigoes which in many are forerunners of this disease as also in some are dimness of sight trembling of the whole body incubus or nightmare often afflicting gnashing of the teeth in sleep and an unusal heaviness of the body it has likewise by many been observed that smoking much tobacco has caused in some constitutions the apoplexy and they give instances of such being seized while they have been smoking and dyed and this they ascribe to its narcotick quality and say by that means it is injurious to the brain and consequently disposes to apoplexies but i am of another opinion as to the thing in general for if tobacco had such a pernicious quality the many years it has been in vogue and the multitudes of people of all sorts that have taken it would have discovered it in an eminent degree and have obliged the world to leave smoking it long ago as deleterious but on the contrary very many people live to a great age and in as good a state of health though they have long and immoderately used it as those that take it not it must indeed be allowed that it is not agreeable to all constitutions but the same may be said of almost every thing else whether food or physic and though we have had instances of some dying of apoplexies that have taken tobacco yet it does not follow that tobacco was the cause and i presume no wise man will conclude from a few instances of the disagreeableness of any one thing to some men when vast numbers of them on the contrary side may be brought to warrant its use that it ought universally to be avoided or branded with a note of infamy my sense of tobacco is that in those persons with whom it is found to agree it is a very good drainer of humors and so may supply the place of issues or at least that fewer of them may be necessary to those who abound with moisture for by its irritating and occasionally enlarging from the great afflux of the saliva the secretory ducts of the glandules about the mouth as it is evident there must be a great discharge so a great diversion is made from the brain though i allow the greatest part of the matter comes not immediately from thence but out of the blood whence it is advisable that the persons who take it should drink but moderately least otherwise they do themselves more hurt by the supply than they can receive benefit by the discharge but there is another reason why tobacco may be useful to those who are disposed or subject to apoplexies i mean to those to whom it is agreeable and that is by the vellication the smoke of it impresses on the nerves of the mouth which it makes to contract so that by consent of parts the whole brain is analogously affected whereby if the brain happens to be more lax than ordinary and is disposed to receive a flux of blood or serum as it will be after a person has had and escaped one fit it will prove a very useful administration toward restoring the tone of it and thereby preventing the admission of heterogenous particles into the tubes of the nerves which cause the symptoms  and since i have spoken about tobacco i will add a word or two concerning snuff which as it causes not through its frequent use any sternutation or sneezing to those who take it constantly is very prejudicial and where immoderately taken by some persons of some constitutions so relaxes the tone of the brain as to dispose to apoplexies and that because the matter of it is gross and apt to lie long about the extremities of the olfactory nerves so as continually to affect them especially where they are ever and anon supplied with more which keeps the pores of those nerves continually open it is the opinion of a very great physician that snuff as now a days used renders those persons that take it liable not only to apoplexies but also to the danger of receiving the pestilence if any such distemper should reign which god forbid and that much sooner than others since from the symptoms the pestilence appears to seize the brain particularly and the sudden fate upon record of those that without any preceding indispofition have whilst the last sickness raged fallen down in the streets was doubtless from the pestilential miasms being easily and at once admitted into the brain by the olfactory or smelling nerves rendered more open and lax by the profuse taking of snuff in those days those people that used it most being the soonest and in the most fatal manner seized with that disease it may here be urged that many who then used it received no apparent injury or do those that take it now adays find any harm by it be it so i think the objection may as well be urged in favor of immoderate drinking many who long indulged themselves in that practice having yet lived to a great age when however it is evident that many more have much shortened their lives by it but though pestilencies from which thanks be to god we are at present free or apoplexies may not be occasioned by the profuse taking of snuff yet the vertigo and other distempers which we find debilitate or hurt the brain may reasonably be supposed from that practice principally to arise  the causes of the apoplexy we have accounted for and also the signs i shall now speak of its seat and then of its prevention and cure the seat of an apoplexy is without doubt in the more inward recess of the brain to wit the corpus callosum and the proximate and immediate subject of the disease is the animal spirits inhabiting therein for that the understanding imagination and common sense are so deeply affected as to be perfectly darkened and to suffer a total eclipse but the immediate subject of this disaffection is thought to be the middle part of the brain because from thence the instincts of all spontaneous motions proceed and in this the perception of all sensible things are terminated  from histories and anatomical observations of persons dying of an apoplexy blood has been found extravasated or out of its proper vessels here and there hi great clots compressing the substance of the brain in others the serous colluvies have overflowed the whole head in others a large bladder of water has been found in one of the ventricles compressing the smaller passages from which observations it may be concluded that the principal places sorely affected are not the greater ventricles but the middle marrowy substance of the brain and cerebel which is every where porus and endued with very many minute passages that both the vital spirits may flow in thither from the blood and the animal spirits may flow forth  the cure of the apoplexy is twofold in the fit or out of the fit the cure out of the fit is properly speaking preventative of which i shall treat after i have shown what is to be done in the fit  the patient being in a fit whether it proceeds from the blood let out of the vessels or a serous or watery humor or the breaking of an imposthume in the brain or other invisible cause the cure must not be the less neglected therefore immediately set the patient as upright as may be for some hours for the disease being a sleepy one if the patient should be put to bed it might incline more to sleep which is expressly against the intention of cure and let him blood plentifully for nothing is more capable of sooner relieving and this distemper of all others requires the most sudden remedy for the disention both of the sanguiferous vessels and habit of the parts being through bleeding removed the fibers which constitute both must be presumed to contract themselves by their tonick motion but especially those in the habit afterward or while this is doing some proper sternutatory must be blown up the nostrils with a quil the best of which i ever knew instantly to bring the patient to himself being my following apoplectick species the virtues of which in one particular case i will here give you  a gentleman being seized with an apoplectick fit several physicians and surgeons were called by the bystanders they all immediately endeavored to let him blood but he would not bleed at length some one by who knew i had medicines for fits and distempers of the head came for me and told me the man was dead if so i said i could not setch him to life but it being the common saying when there is danger that the patient is either dead or dying in hopes the messenger might be mistaken away i went taking with me a little of my apoplectick species when i got thither i beheld the miserable object as one dead indeed he lying so very stupefied as that no life could be perceived to be in him and as a dead man i looked upon him bleed i found he would not nor could any thing be got down his throat therefore i instantly blew a little of my species forcibly up his nostrils by which means he a little while after began to stir i then blew up a little more upon which a large evacuation of pus water and viscous matter mixed with blood was immediately made whereupon he a little revived and being almost come to himself a very great flux of blood near upon a quart presently followed through his nostrils so that in about an hours time or a little more after the use of the species he perfectly recovered from his fit his understanding speech and senses being all restored this danger being over the next thing to be considered for him was how to prevent any more fits for the future therefore i ordered him my cephalic pills and cephalic elixir prescribed in chapter the first to be taken as there directed which had the desired effect  my apoplectick species i thus prepare take lilly of the valley flowers lavender and rosemary flowers of each three drams marjoram betony of each two drams galangal pellitory of spain rocket seeds of each half a dram nutmegs a dram and half the best castor a dram powder them all very fine and sprinkle them with essence of cloves essence of amber and the best east india oil of cinnamon equal parts of each sufficient to make them into a paste which then put into a small digesting glass well luted that nothing may evaporate set it in a very moderate sandheat tilt all the liquid is thoroughly imbibed and the powder become dry then take the glass out of the sand and when it is cold take out the powder and rub it in a glass mortar adding to it flowers of benjamin a dram volatile salt of amber a dram and half yellow precipitate artfully prepared and very finely poudered three drams mix all together very well and keep it in a glass very well stopped that no air may get to it for use  in a fit of the apoplexy besides bleeding and using my apoplectick species above prescribed the mouth of the patient must if possible be opened and kept so and something given to drink if it be no more than about twenty drops of spirit of sal armoniack or hartshorn in a glass of fair water also the arms hands thighs legs and feet are to be chafed or rubbed with oil of amber or the like also a glister is to be given him forthwith if it be possible to be done likewise cuppings with scarifications blisters and issues which latter take up so much more time to relieve than there is to be had in such dangerous cases the only present help in the exigency is bleeding and the use of my apoplectick species with anointing unless any thing can be gotten down the throat as just now mentioned  as the recovering a patient out of a fit of the apoplexy when there is so much danger and life is so imminently threatened is a very happy thing so to prevent the fits for the future or secure those from them that have the symptoms of them is not a much less good service for we have seen and known many that have had one fit after another and each fit more dangerous till at length life has been carried away indeed therefore though it be difficult to prevent the fits yet i persuade my self if the patient follow the rules i shall lay down he will not only be secured from more while he is taking the medicines but will find the very cause of the disease taken away so effectually that upon his desisting to take them he will hear no more of his malady  therefore let such that are subject to the apoplexy or in fear of that disease take three of my gephalick pills every fourth or fifth morning which will gently purge him calling away humors from the blood which infest the brain and those mornings he does not take the pills he is to take ffty drops of my cephalic elixir in a glass of fair water or mixed with a little wine if the water be too raw for his stomach as also the same dose every night going to bed which elixir is a specific midicine corroborating the head brain and spirits and keeping the blood in due order and if he finds any disposition to a fit by any of the signs or symptoms mentioned to attend apoplexies he should once a week snuff up into each nostril the quantity of a very small white pea of my apoplectick species aforementioned at night an hour or two before he goes to bed which will purge the head and brain and discharge from the nostrils and mouth a large quantity o viscous humor that in those cases infest the brain whereby the patient will be much more lightsome and easy as by so much the brain has been cleared of the humor offending it thus will no people in my opinion be troubled with apoplexies as we frequently see they are i taking the medicines i have recommended to be such for those purposes as are not to be excelled and hope those that use them will have cause to say their effect have not fallen short of my account of them  chap ix of the palsy and other nervous diseases the palsy is a resolution or relaxation of the nerves from their due habit by which means motion and sense sometimes one only sometimes both together in the whole body or in some part or parts thereof cannot be used or exercised after their due manner  it is a disease either perfect in which sense and motion are quite lost and gone or imperfect wherein sense or motion are only decayed or diminished so as to occasion a trembling or shaking of the parts affected and in this latter if the diminution be but small it cannot be properly called a palsy but a stupor or a numbness which however is commonly the forerunner of a true palsy  a palsy may be either from the hurt of the motive faculty the sense remaining sound or from the hurt of the sensitive the motive remaining well the cause may be either from a solution of unity in the nerves as by a bruise from a fall or blow or by a wound or from a relaxation of the vertebrae of the back suddenly caused or it may come from innate causes or cold pituitous humors which relax and dissolve the tone of the nerves or from straitness or narrowness of the nerves caused by obstructions or by constipation from some tumor etc or from thin sharp serous and windy humors moved in the bowels not only to the beginning of the orifices of the nerves but to the very muscles and tendons or it may proceed from causes external and foreign as from narcoticks or poisons immeasurably drinking strong liquors the taking of henbane opium quicksilver antimony arsnick or the like to the external causes may also be added the excess of heat or cold by the first of which the spirits are wasted and spent and by the latter they are obstructed in their passages by congelation etc or it comes by consent of parts and that for the most part in scorbutic habits of body but the general causes of a palsy are all those which hinder the passages of the animal spirits into the nerves and muscles and in whatever part they are interrupted from flowing there will be a palsy in that part it being impossible for the nerves to act or perform their function as they ought without being sufficiently filled and invigorated by the spirits  in whatever place i say this hindrance happens whether about the spinal marrow or about the conjugations or branches of the nerves proceeding therefrom it causes a palsy either of more or fewer parts according as the nerves affected are more general or particular  if the nerves that take their rise near the brain or in the beginning of their passage from the brain or the spinal marrow lying just under the brain be hurt or affected there is commonly a general palsy wherein also breathing the voice speech and swallowing with some excressive motions do suffer hurt but if the hurt is in the following production of this marrow it makes those members only paralytick into which its branches or nerves are inserted but the palsy is so much the more general by how much the effect of the said spinal marrow is near to the brain or original of the nerves  if the eye be affected with the palsy the visive nerves are originally hurt as also the cerebrum it self if the tongue is paralytick the conjugation of nerves serving the tongue is hurt and the speech is also defective and by reason of its community with the auditory nerve if the defect be so great as to cause a total loss of speech the patient is for the most part deaf also if there be a palsy of the larynx jaws midriff as also of the bladder and fundament the nerves of the sixth and seventh conjugations are hurt about their original if there be a defect of the voice the recurrent nerve is affected if there be a defect in swallowing the nerves that go to the muscles of the jaws are hurt if there be danger of suffocation the nerves that go to the midriff are hurt though the midriff the instrument of breathing can otherwise in some sort perform its office for that it receives nerves also from the spinal marrow  if the sphincter muscles of the bladder and anus be paralytick there follows an involuntary voiding of urine and the excrements the conjugations of nerves supplying those parts being generally affected or hurt  if the palsy is in the legs the nerves affected are about the bottom of the spinal marrow and the vertebrae of the os sacrum and thus we must search out for the place whence the nerves spring which are dispersed to those parts affected with the palsy and that being known the cure is the easier accomplished from these things it is apparent what conjugation of nerves are most affected when the palsy is in this or that part only but when there is an universal palsy there is for the most part an affection of the whole genus nervosum or nervous system which comes to pass from one or more of the causes already mentioned  the signs of the palsy are manifest to wit deprivation of sense and motion of the parts the eye if that be affected is weakened and depraved on that side where the part is affected for want of nourishment the speech is much altered the urine is most times white and thin by means of obstructions if it comes from a blow fall wound etc or upon an apoplexy lethargy carus or other effects of the brain or genus nervosum it will not quickly be cured no more will the palsy in young people proceeding from a cold and moist matter because of the dissimilitude of the disease to the nature of such patients the palsy in old people is never perfectly cured because they want natural heat and an inveterate palsy is most commonly incurable  the cure of the palsy therefore is uncertain according as is the cause and strength of the disease and constitution of the patient nor is it in any cured but by first and chiefly altering the whole habit of the body rectifying the discracy of the blood and removing the morbifick matter offending and that at last by strengthening the parts hurt that they may for the future be able to resist all other assaults of the disease  to do this medicines must be both inwardly taken and outwardly applied authors have not been sparing in their prescriptions for that purpose there being numbers of them to be met with but it is to be doubted many of them would be found to be of very little if any effect i have known many of the reputed celebrated ones made use of but the benefit was not equivalent to the trouble nor indeed can i say any one of the many i have met with have come near answering their characters though i my self have used them with the strictest care and observation which put me upon considering how to find out those that might be effectual and which i have accomplished so far as to cure in many cases of that kind i might say most and even in inveterate palsies by a constant application of those medicines i know not what effects may be produced it may be more than i am willing to say or the patient expect  the medicines i speak of are only two one is my paralytick elixir for inward use which is this  the paralytick elixir take pellitory of spain long pepper and ginger of each an ounce scorzonera cloves mace and cinnamon of each six drams zedoary galangal nutmegs wood of aloes and juniper berries of each ten drams black pepper cardamoms dittany coriander seeds alkermes berries cubebs and bay berries of each one ounce orange peel and citron peel of each six drams spicknard sage rosemary lavender chamomile flowers and pennyroyal of each an ounce salt of tartar half an ounce out slice and bruise the ingredients as they require and put them into a digesting glass and pour upon them a pint and half of compound radish water doubly distilled let them digest close stopped that nothing may evaporate for forty eight hours in a sand heat and when cold strain off the liquor pressing the ingredients strongly in a press then put the ingredients into the digesting glass again and pour upon them another pint and half of compound radish water digesting and pressing out the liquor as before mix the two liquors together in a fresh digesting glass to which put of the finest succotrina aloes an ounce salt of amber an ounce and half volatile salts of hartshorn and armoniack of each half an ounce camphir an ounce digest them close stopped in a sand heat for forty eight hours or so long as till it be elixirated which will be when the aloes salts and camphir are perfectly dissolved and united with the liquor the dose is fifty or sixty drops  the other is my nerve fotus for outward use and is thus prepared take oil of amber of turpentine of bays and of spike of each half a pint mix them together and put them into a glass retort with galbanum and gum elemi of each an ounce let them stand a week or ten days in digestion close stopped in a moderate sand heat then take nutmegs cloves galangal cinnamon zedoary pepper and cubebs of each an ounce salt of tartar two drams rectified spirit of wine twelve ounces put them all into a digesting glass and let them stand in a sand heat for a week or ten days after which put them to the other ingredients in the retort and distill them first will come off a spirit than a yellow oil and at last a black oil which mix altogether and add to them four ounces of camphir and digest them close stopped so long as till they are all united and it is done  the abovesaid elixir is to be taken in drops fifty or sixty at a time every night and morning in a glass of the following drink which will keep the body soluble with the nerve fotus the parts affected are to be bathed every night and morning cold as it is and is to be rubbed in with the hand till it is all dried in and if the spine or backbone from the nape of the neck to the rump be bathed with it also it will be so much the better  the drink to take the elixir in is this take new ale from the tun four gallons white wine one gallon juice of scurvy grass three pints juices of tarragon watercresses and brooklime of each one pint shavings of horseradish roots mustard seed bruised of each four ounces and an half put the ingredients into a bag which put into the ale and juices first mixed together let them work up all together and when the fermentation is over and the drink settled which will be in about five or six days bottle it off putting a clove slit into each bottle and also an ounce of white sugar  in half a pint of this drink the drops are to be taken and the drink may be drank by it self at table or any other time if the patient pleases but where the case is slight or the patient cares not for the trouble of preparing this drink the paralytick elixir may be taken in a glass of wine and water or any other convenient agreeable liquor  by the volatile and operative quality of the drink and elixir a speedy flowing of the spirits will be let into the genus nervosum for they not only alter the blood and juices of the whole body but also remove the offending cause circulate the spirits and give strength and that as well in all manner of diseases of the nerves as in the palsy and with that good effect that it is believed no medicines can do more  a certain gentleman by a fall from his own coach hurt his back that he could not stand upright at length it brought on a palsy some part of the nerves of the seventh vertebrae being hurt in their original to cure him many things were applied but in vain till being told of my curing diseases of the head brain and nerves he sent to me an account of his case i gave the messenger a bottle of my paralytick elixir and another of my nerve fotus which he taking and using as i directed became perfectly well in twelve days time though he had kept his bed seven weeks before  chap x of the epilepsy or falling sickness also convulsions and cramp the epilepsy or falling sickness is a convulsive motion of the whole body coming by fits depriving the sick suddenly both of reason and sense wherein the whole body is contracted galen calls the falling sickness always a convulsion but improperly for it is not a true convulsion but a convulsive motion of the whole body wherein all the external and internal senses are abolished  it is called the falling sickness because many times the persons afflicted fall down when their fits come upon them it is also called morbus sacer either because it does contaminate as it were the sacred soul or life or because it is seated in the head the sacred temple of the soul as philosophers say or else called so from the greatness of the disease or rather because it is a disease not often cured if it be inveterate by humane help but by divine aid it is also by authors called morbus herculeus and that either because hercules as the poets feign was taken with this distemper or because it is hard like his labors and difficult to cure others call it morbus puerilis because children when they begin to have teeth are often seized with this disease also morbus comitialis because it takes men on a sudden when they are in company also morbus lunaticus because people are generally seized with it at certain times of the moon as the new and full likewise morbus sonticus because it is a distemper that much afflicts and hurts the person who has it  when the fit comes the patient falls down is plucked up together trembles turns about snorts cries out and foams at the mouth and makes a kind of roaring or howling noise clashing or grating and closing his teeth fast shutting and holding together his fingers voiding his urine and excrements insensibly and foaming at mouth froth like the white of an egg worked with a wisk  it is caused of gross phlegm or sharp choler obstructing the passage of the spirits in the ventricles of the brain which within pulls or twinges the principal nerves and thereby causes a straitning of the passage by which there follows a drawing back and shutting up of the animal spirits which cause sense from defect of which there follows immediately all the symptoms of this disease and by which the parts suffer a convulsive motion  though what has been said to be the cause yet there are many afflicted with this disease hereditarily from the same diseasy principle in their parents so that they bring it into the world with them but upon general observation it is a disease chiefly occasioned by some posterous accident  there are differences of this disease according to its cause and the constitution it seizes on one is recent or but newly begun the other inveterate and of long standing there is also another more mild in which some certain parts suffer only a convulsion or else more grievous wherein there is a convulsion of the whole body another is periodical coming once or twice a year or once or twice a month at new or full moon or oftener but always keeping its certain times though others again i have known to be surpised with the fits unawares  it is a disease to some from an epileptick disposition in the brain to others from a preceding cause in the inferior parts to others from distempers of the stomach to others from worms to others from the womb and to others from hurts of the external parts it never seizes some till they are grown up in years and others never but in their infancy but though it most commonly happens to children yet it sometimes afflicts grown persons and it is remarked by galen to be a disease incurable if it takes them after the age of twenty five years  the cure of this disease is twofold when the disease is upon them and when the fit is over  when the fit is upon them authors advise to give a few drops of spirit of hartshorn castor or the like in a glass of fair water and to smell to the same rubbing the nostrils a little with it or with oil of amber and when the fit is over to prevent it for the future they order blisters glisters purges vomits cuppings and the like and give specificks inwardly which they prescribe but they are so numerous that it is inconsistent with the brevity i design in this treatise to note them as it is judged they would many of them at least be as insignificant if i did  i have attended many patients in my time both in and out of the fits and though i have used many things recommended i could not find any thing come near my epileptick spirit following both to recover patients when in fits and to rectify the indisposition of the parts in order to prevent them for the future but the method i use when i see any one in a fit is this i immediately blow a little of my apoplectick species prescribed in chapter the  th up each nostril and give inwardly a few drops of the epileptick spirit as thirty to a grown person and five or six to children in a glass of fair water rubbing the nostrils temples top of the head and nape of the neck with a little of the spirit also which almost instantly as soon as the species begin to operate brings the patient out of the fit after that is done to prevent the fits for the future i first purge the patient with my cephalic pills prescribed in the  st chapter giving them as there directed according to age or strength every third or fourth day and in the intermediate days i give thirty forty or fifty drops of my epileptick spirit every night and morning in a glass of fair water which is the best vehicle and order the top of the head nape of the neck temples and backbone to be rubbed with my nerve fotus prescribed in the  th chapter every night and morning which wonderfully corrects and alters the humors of the body and strengthens the whole man especially if the course be continued for some time after the time the fits usually return and i believe scarce one patient in twenty where the disease is not hereditary will by this method ever fail of being cured  the epileptick spirit is thus made take forty live swallows six young magpies two ravens beat them all to mash feathers and all white peacocks dung half a found misletoe of the oak and male piony roots of each six ounces castor an ounce mans skull four ounces piony seeds acorns roots of each an ounce and half the blood of a deer fresh killed four pounds lavender and rosemary flowers of each four handfuls bruise them all small put them into a retort and pour upon them of the strongest compound piony water two quarts fit a receiver to the retort luting it well and set it to digest for forty days in horse dung then distill in sand with a moderate heat lest the ingredients burn to dryness to every pint of the distilld spirit add spirit of amber lavender and rosemary of each an ounce spirit of mans skull elkshoof and hartshorn of each six drams tincture of luna and coral of each two ounces volatile salt of amber and mansskull of each half an ounce mix all together very well and let it stand close stopped in a sand heat till the salts are dissolved and the whole is entirely incorporated which will be in about five days and it is done dose forty or fifty drops  the like good service will these medicines i have now mentioned do in convulsions which is a disease from a forced contraction of the nerves and muscles toward their original which is the brain and spinal marrow wherein the voluntary motion of the joints is hurt the natural form and situation is depraved or changed and the parts affected are annoyed with a most sharp pain  there are four kinds of convulsions one when the whole body is bended or drawn forward another when the whole body is convulsed and drawn backward another when the convulsion is equally both ways so that the whole body is stiff like a stake that it cannot be moved any way and the other is when it happens to a particular part as the hands arms legs thighs hips and sometimes remarkable when it happens to the bowels stomach etc when it happens to the hands arms legs etc it is what is called the cramp  the brain is oftentimes affected in this disease and sometimes the marrow of the back or spina medullae as also the nerves and muscles as said before the signs are manifest and the causes many as from wounds loss of much blood cold humors phlegm the taking of hellebore drunkenness surfeiting pricking a nerve or tendon worms biting of venomous beasts or the like but be the cause from what it will i could never find the cure better or sooner accomplished than by the method and medicines a little before mentioned and prescribed which if followed as directed for the falling sickness answers the intention so much as i may presume to say nothing can do more and one thing i cannot but note before i leave this chapter which is that for the cramp of the legs etc which many people are often troubled with there is not a better medicine upon earth to bathe with than my nerve fotus mentioned in the  th chapter as they that use it will say  chap xi of the incubus or nightmare the nightmare or as some call it the hag is a nocturnal disease arising from thick vapors which chiefly obstruct the hinder part of the brain by which the flux of animal spirits being stopped breathing is hindered the voice intercepted and the body so oppressed as it were between sleeping and waking with a weight lying upon the breast and holding fast the man that notwithstanding all his endeavors the whole faculty of moving seems for a season to be abolished  i say in the time of the fit the patient endeavors and strives with vehemence to stir move and shake off his burden but in vain for when the fit is off and he comes to himself he finds he is not moved an hairs breadth but lies in the same place and posture though he thought he struggled strongly with what oppressed him and that he cried out when indeed he never spoke one word but because of the great oppression about the heart and midriff and fear of suffocation he commonly groans and thereby expresses the weight of his affliction with fear and terror and though this disease so strongly seizes the universal man in the fit as to abolish all manner of external motion yet it hurts the understanding and internal senses but little nor indeed the common sense of feeling because if any one being by does but touch or pull the patient tho he be in the height of the fit he will immediately come to himself and perfectly remember and tell all the circumstances of the affliction  as from the great oppression the patient groans so also are the inward senses of many so disturbed as that they believe it was a spirit that held them or that they were hagridden whence comes the name or that some witch or devil sometimes in one shape sometimes in another as of a dog a cat bear etc lies upon and oppresses them and will possitively tell you and themselves verily believe it that they struck the devil or witch when at the same time they never stirred their hands or arms as aforesaid an hairs breadth from the place  this disease happens to those who sleep on their back and rarely to those who sleep on their sides those who have this disease much and often are in danger of falling into the apoplexy vertigo madness palsy or epilepsy many children dye of this disease in the night by reason of abundance of thick vapors arising from the milk they suck by which means many nurses have been hardly and unjustly censured for overlaying their nurseries when i truth they have dyed of this disease those tha use a temperate diet are seldom molested with the nightmare but it chiefly happens to such as ar loaded with crudities and are intemperate as also to corpulent people and children and others who eat too much especially at night and have bad digestions  the indications of the cure of this distemper are threefold first the humor or matter that interrupts the flux of the animal spirits is to be removed which is done by proper evacuating medicines secondly the discrasy of the blood is to be rectified and reduced to its prestine state of health which is done by specific and alterative medicines thirdly the parts affected and weakened by the force of the morbifick matter are to be strengthened to do which the same order and method and the same medicaments that i have recommended in the last chapter for the cure of the falling sickness are most proper though truly medicines less in power and virtue than they are endued with might in this disease serve the turn though i cannot but say as they are the most powerful so they are more certain and speedy in their operation and less of them than others will suffice to complete the cure i do therefore for those reasons recommend them and assure the patient that he will not be mistaken in his expectations of a cure by their use  chap xii of a catarrh or defluxion of rheum hurting the sight hearing smelling tasting swallowing etc a catarrh or defluxion or as some call it a distillation is a flowing of some excrementitious humors from the brain to the lower parts as to the eyes nose mouth palate throat lungs etc so that the brain is chiefly affected the concoctive faculty of it being hurt or the expulsive faculty irritated and stirred up from an abundant repletion of phlegmatic rheum either generated in the brain from the hurt of the concoctive faculty or through the fault of the brain it self  there are many kinds of those rheums some more thick others more thin some acrid and salt others more sweet some flow more violently others more slowly if it be hot it is sharp and thin flowing by the nose and mouth the forehead and face are hot and the nose many times swells if it be cold there is a pain and dullness of the head the humor that flows down is not sharp or pricking but the patient is drowsy his eyes dazzle his hearing thick his nostrils stopped all his senses dull his eyes and his whole body heavy and lumpish and each of these is more or less as the humor falls more or less upon that part if the rheum falls upon the eyes they look red swelled and sore damaging the sight if not soon cured if upon the nose there is stoppage of the nostrils loss of smelling and the nostrils are sore by the sharpness of the humor and violent sneezings follow if it falls upon the ears it causes pain in them deafness and oftentimes imposthumes if it descends upon the palate it causes inflammation of it relaxation of the uvula which old women call the falling down of the palate swelling and soreness also hurt of the taste if the rheum falls upon the throat it causes inflammation and swelling of the glandules vulgarly called the almonds of the ears and deemed their falling down and hinders swallowing so that nothing can be got down but with very great difficulty if the rheum rushes down upon the lungs it causes if it be sharp and violent a dangerous suffocation or at least an obstruction of the lungs from whence often ensues shortness of breath difficulty of breathing and a vehement cough which if not in time remedied brings the patient into a consumption if the catarrhous humor translates itself upon the limbs joints or nerves as it will in time if not carried off there is pain weakness and trembling  sometimes the superfluous humor is thrown upon the glandules of the whole body which alters their tone so that if it happens upon the glands of the mesentery there follows a watery dispoition of the whole body which sometimes endangers  dropsy or other desperate dsease  the causes of those rheums are many as corupt air hot liquors and spices taken out of meaure but the chief cause is an over hot or over cold or moist distemperature of the brain but ome authors say that a hot liver and cold stomach re the two chief seminaries of rheums but as in every catarrh it is evident the matter flows from he head that and the brain are chiefly to be taken are of so as that they be purged with proper purges and after that corroborated the superfluous moisture dried up and the part or parts to which he rheum flows must at last be strengthened  to accomplish this i know nothing better than first to purge with my cephalic pills prescribed in he first chapter to be taken every other day till he rheum is abated and also on those days you do not purge to take at night going to bed and in he morning at rising a dose of my cephalic elixir ikewise prescribed in the said first chapter and to athe all the head nape of the neck temples and ehind the ears with my nerve fotus prescribed n the ninth chapter which strictly followd will oth remove the offending humor corroborate he head and brain and strengthen the weakened arts beyond any thing perhaps known or used  finis a discourse of the nature real cause and certain cure of melancholy in men and vapors in women instructing persons how to cure themselves absolutely of those perplexing and pernicious disorders with safety ease and expedition  chap i of melancholy its nature cause and cure though melancholy cannot be strictly said to be a disease of the head yet as the head is oftentimes disturbed by it it comes properly enough to be spoken of here  melancholy or as some call it the hippo is a sort of dotage arising from disturbd phantasms filling the person afflicted with anxious thoughts and solitariness being as it were ingulphed therein with pensiveness fury or fever some are afflicted with a deep sadness or pensiveness without apparent cause and a long continued silence or else an incongruous talk at random of some particular thing it is caused by a distemper of the animal spirits hurt by a malancholly phantasm or vapor made misty opacous thick and dark almost fixed and immovable and from thence it is that melancholy people are tenacious for that all kinds of objects are fixed in their minds according to the condition and quality of the depraved spirits and this is acquired either from a default in the brain declining from its genuine whiteness and generating such like spirits or from a default of the blood and vital spirits or from some degenerate melancholy matter as humor vapor or both mingled with the blood and spirits if it proceeds from the brain it is known by sadness fearfulness hatred and other strange imaginations some think themselves beasts some one thing some another some would kill themselves others are afraid some laugh some weep some prophecy etc which shows it is from melancholy blood  the species or kinds of melancholy are many as first that of the brain when it declines in quality or substance from its purity and cleanness which is known by a perpetual and vehement doting arising either externally from strange fancy and imagination as from fear despair and such like sad afflictions of the mind which dry up the radical moisture and cause cares watchings etc or internally from a melancholy humor gathered together in the head either by some cold or dry matter left behind in the brain after some hot distemper the thinner part of the matter being resolved and gone or from a melancholy habit and constitution either hereditary from the parents blood or from a cold and dry or hot and dry disposition of the body causing either doting with laughter or a dull slothfulness or anger discontent and peevishness   dly another kind of melancholy is that of the whole body the blood having acquired a melancholy habit distributing the same to all the parts and then to the brain this is known because the dotage or delirium is indeed continual but so that it is with some exasperations and remissions with general signs of a melancholy habit   dly there is another sort of that distemper called the melancholy of the heart when the vital spirits that are there bred by reason of a cold and dry distemper are made impure   thly there is that which is hypochondriacal wherein melancholy juice either cold and serous or adust and burnt in the branches of the vena porta is gathered together in the hypochondria which occasions the most common sort of melancholy from whence time after time black melancholy vapors are continually sent forth to corrupt the animal spirits in the brain and this is known by its seizing the patient by intervals and certain seasons but in its approach it surprises without any notice except by windy belchings and a pain distending the stomach with anxiety of mind difficulty of breathing palpitation of the heart immoveableness of the tongue mist or darkness before the eyes noise in the ears and a stupidity or benumbedness in both arms these melancholy vapors or humors are transmitted from the hypochondria to the brain either by the orifice of the stomach as some imagine or else by the branches of the vena cava where they cloud and darken the spirits   thly there is melancholy of the womb in women which is discovered by a pain in the leftside and a manifest pulse and beating in the back near the diaphragm being caused by stoppage of the courses or other natural evacuations   thly there is a melancholy from love occasioned either from philters or love potions or else from a lustful appetite or desire of venery caused from an hot constitution and an over abundance of seed in which case the fancy is not fixed upon one person but the patient by fits delights to be in the company of men promiscuously talks leudly and is ready to call them to her though before and at other times she is very chaste and modest  but as the sort of melancholy which generally afflicts people is that of the hypochonders it may not be amiss to say something more at large of its nature and after that of its cause before i come to show the cure of it  hypochondriack melancholy is a collection of filthy and vicious humors in the branches of the vena porta caeliacal and mesenterical arteries by reason of a fault of the concoction of the spleen without putrefaction thence sending many vapors causing imminent symptoms it is called hypochondriacal because it possesses the place of both hypochonders viz that part of the body which under the bastard or short ribs reaches as far as the loins on both sides comprehending with the muscles the bowels themselves and called melancholy when the brain is affected by consent  those that are afflicted with hypochondriack melancholy find a rawness windiness sharp belchings crudities burning and pain of the stomach and sides which are plucked upwards and sometimes inflamed the belly is bound sleep little and that with troublesome dreams sadness given to be thoughtful idle etc these are the general symptoms but the more particular ones which people afflicted find more or less according as they are of constitution etc are ranged as follow viz  i crudity of the stomach so sower sometimes as to set the teeth an edge ii pains in the stomach reaching even to the back and returning upon eating iii costiveness of body from an universal melancholy habit iv an inflammation of the hypochonders attended with redness of the cheeks and sudden flushings in the face v urine sometimes thin and pale like water and sometimes thick and troubled with now and then a sediment of red sand vi a motion of wind in the left hypochonder causing great pain vii anxiety caused by wind distending the hypochonders thereby causing a straitness in those parts which have nerves from the sixth conjugation viii a palpitation of the heart either from the malignity of the vapors in the part or by consent of the stomach ix a beating in the left hypochonder caused either by the great pulsation of the caeliacal branch of the arteries after anger or violent motion or by the compression of the arteries in the mesentery by the glandules being more than ordinarily extended x a dryness in the mouth tongue and palate by reason of hot vapors ascending through the gullet and rough artery xi a difficulty of breathing both by reason of the affection of the nerves dedicated to the muscles of the breast and of the affusion of evil matter into the spaces of the muscles xii a perturbation of the brain from vapors resolved which if they be obscure they darken the spirits and cause melancholy dotage if dry an epilepsy and watchings and if many the vertigo and a fear of strangling or stupidity these are the symptoms of hypochondriack melancholy but all of them are rarely to be seen in one person the most certain symptoms that always attend are grippings and wind in the bowels a weak stomach and sometimes a very keen one costiveness belchings palpitation of the heart perturbations of the head and a disturbed or uneasy mind  the symptoms being thus premised let us now inquire more particularly after their cause the first cause is a vicious acid in the stomach enlarging the appetite but unfit for digestion hence ensues an acid crudity in the first passages which depraves the crasis of the blood prevents the due separation of the volatile spirits upon which the lymphatick juice becomes acid and the bileous juice inactive  these are the sources of all the preceding symptoms since wind noise griping in the guts and costiveness are the natural result of a viscous acid in the first passages as also flushings in the face arising from its effervessence with the bile the convulsions of the nervous membranes in several parts of the body are the effects of its irritation its crudity impairs the due fermentation of the blood and causes a palpitation of the heart and difficulty in breathing it depraves the nutritious juice of the bowels which settles into hard swellings and occasions a degeneracy and austerity in the spirits hence fear melancholy irregular thoughts and uncouth emotions ensue  the procatartick or remote causes that promote crudities are acid liquors or salt victuals or such as are dried in the smoke both which partake of the acid spirit of salt or soot want of motion to promote digestion and the speedy assimilation of chyle nocturnal study or care exhausting the blood and rendering the lympha acid which at length brings on a nervous atrophy this disease being an enemy to the nervous system  so much for the symptoms and causes of the hypochondriack disease which is generally observed to happen to scorbutic bodies and to people of the best sense and good understanding it being seldom seen that fools and blockheads are troubled with that distemper  this disease is truly difficult to cure by reason of the mighty heap of symptoms that commonly attend persons afflicted with it it is seldom mortal but of very long continuance sometimes lasting even the whole period of life for which reason it is called the disgrace of physicians  if it be attended with continual pain and giddiness of the head it gives fears of the epilepsy apoplexy or blindness if it be accompanied with a moderate flux of the belly for it is good to be loose bad to be costive vomiting or haemorrhoids it is good but if those fluxes continue long it is dangerous sometimes the patient seems to be cured and then in a few months it returns again it is much easier cured if taken in the beginning and happening to people neither in a full or declining age also men are easier cured than women the fat and fair than the lean and swarthy  the cure of this distemper consists primarily and peculiarly in opening all obstructions in the stomach bowels and other passages by which the digestions may be perfected and good chyle assimilated secondly in tempering the evil quality of the humors thirdly in evacuating the morbifick matter fourthly in altering the habit of the body and strengthening the weakened parts  to accomplish these four intentions authors prescribe more medicines than there are symptoms and which for any one to follow would rather perplex than profit some run altogether on steel courses and prescribe them promiscuously to all others are much devoted to testaceous pouders which they call sweetners others again to acids and others in opposition to alcalies some are for volatile salts and spirits others for fixed salts and cardiacks some highly applaud emeticks others condemn them and cry up catharticks others are for alteratives others for aperitives and thus do they vary as their opinions or inclinations lead them without considering with that mature judgment they ought or making just observations which is the reason so few are cured or so ordinarily relieved  but as the whole cure of this distemper hinges upon the four points mentioned when those points are maturely considered and medicines accordingly adapted it is not to be doubted but the end will be accomplished and to speak truly i never found where the patient was steady in the method prescribed him but that in the end a cure was obtained  to do this i rely upon the two medicines following viz my hypochondriacum digestivum and pulvis corroborans the first answers the three first intentions of cure and the second the last but as this disease is most commonly chronick and lasting they must be taken for some time together or else a cure cannot be expected at least wise to be durable it being the nature of it to return again if the cause be not totally removed and the tone of the parts fully recovered therefore the patient is first to take my hypochondriacum digestivum for so long time as that he finds no remains of the disease but is free in every respect from each particular symptom and this he may expect to find in about five or six weeks time if the disease be not very inveterate and when the symptoms are off he is to take my pulvis corroborans to strengthen the tone of the parts the crasis of the blood being beforehand brought to rights and that he is to continue for about three four or five weeks or longer if he finds any remaining weakness or other indisposition to give him fear of a return of his illness  my hypochondriacum digestivum is thus prepared take filings of steel and salt armoniack of each four ounces powder the latter and let the former be clean from dust and put them into a sublimatory and sublime according to art when the glass is cold open it and dissolve the sublimed matter in as small a quantity of fair water as will be sufficient to do it when it is dissolved filter it and precipitate the filtrated liquor by dropping into it gradatim and separately spirit of salt armoniack and oil of tartar per deliquium of each as much as you find sufficient first a few drops of one and then of the other and so on alternately till nothing further subsides pour off the clear liquor by inclination and dry the precipitate according to art to every ounce of which add an ounce and half of the duplicate secret an ounce of black hellebore prepared half an ounce of epithymum agarick diagrydium of each six drams lapis lazuli prepared three drams make all into fine powder and mix them together very well and keep it always close stoped for use a paper of this containing half a dram is a dose  this hypochondriacum digestivum is to be taken a paper at a time containing half a dram every night and morning in a glass of white wind and water which will give one stool or perhaps two in a day but if that evacuation should be too much to hold it daily for so long a time as mentioned then he is to take two thirds of a paper at a time or but half a paper or less according as he finds he can bear it  when the patient has done with that medicine as directed or has taken it for five or six weeks then although he should not find himself quite well it will be best for him omitting that to begin the pulvis corroborans and take one paper of it at a time every night and morning mixed in the morning in a glass of german spaw water drinking the remainder of the flask within the compass of an hour or hour and half after it and that at night in a glass of red wine and water this medicine has no evacuating operation unless a little by urine and is made as follows  the pulvis corroborans take of the best salt armoniack and the finest filings of steel purified of each two ounces grind them gently on a marble with a mullet till they are fine then put them into an earthen still and sublime first with a gentle fire then with a stronger increasing the fire by degrees when all is sublimed break the sill and keep the upper part of it that is white to make a new sublimation with fresh filings keep also the yellow part which is the diaphoretick flowers of steel then take out the caput mortuum in the bottom and extract the salt with water which purify by solution filtration and coagulation powder the coagulaled salt and and to every ounce of it the best oriental pearl prepared powder of china roots of each half an ounce red coral toasted silk of each three drams galangal zedoary cloves nutmegs cinnamon xyloaloes ginger red roses of each a dram and half mace spodium indian spikenard schaenanth storaxcalamita cardamoms myrtleberries long pepper of each a dram marjoram costmary basil of each four scruples alkermes berries two drams powder all very fine and keep it close stopped for use the dose is a paper containing two scruples in the vehicle before mentioned  he may go abroad with these medicines and by all means should use exercise during the whole time of his taking them and none like that of the horse to ride every forenoon about two hours after rising for an hour or two which procures him an appetite to his dinner and to ride again about two hours more which facilitates digestion and besides that will by the shaking stir up for natural evacuations those stagnating juices which would otherwise subside but by riding i do not mean he must ride hard either to tire or sweat but ad ruborem sed non sudorem and so as to be as easy and lightsome when he gets off his horse as when he got on he may eat fresh meat and that heartily all sorts of herbs fruits or the like that are agreeable and drink now and then a glass two or three of good red wine such as florence viana portugal or french wine and for his constant drink he must take wine and water instead of malt liquors all which if he observes and also follows his medicines and riding daily as directed his cure will certainly be effected as he him self will have reason to believe by his daily and almost hourly mending after once the humors begin to be moved off which he will find in about a week or ten days after he has entered the course by this means i have cured many and some whose cases were very inveterate and as believed by those they had before applied to for help incurable i could give instances of several with their names but the former being inconsistent with the designed brevity of this treatise and being prohibited the latter i shall only insert one case and conclude this chapter  a gentleman highly scorbutic fell into a melancholy with pains in the hypochondria which afflicting him for a long time vitiated all the juices of his body and wholly subverted the concoctions insomuch that he had most of the worst symptoms mentioned to attend that distemper as flushing heats pains in the head wind belchings tremblings horrors frights and the like for which he had purged times without number bled and taken antiscorbuticks of all kinds with all the testaceous pouders which are reckoned sweetners had passed through long courses of steel drank all sorts of mineral waters had suffered the penance of seatons issues blisters and cuppings to ease his head which used very much to be disordered till at length being quite tired out by his disease and medicines he resolved to desist and as patiently as he could wait for his appointed departure which he was certain to himself could not be long his illness being such as nature to his thinking could not long subsist under thus being in a manner quite worn out and lamenting his hard fortune to a friend that came to see him who had been my patient he told him what i had done for him and others in distempers of the head and advised him to consult me which he did and whom as soon as ever i had heard his complaints i told he would certainly be well if he would observe the rules i prescribed him which he heartily promised the news of having his health again being such as would make him do he said any thing i forthwith began with him and gave him the very medicines i have prescribed in the order i have before spoken of with directions for him to ride on horseback twice every day for two hours each time which he did and with that wonderful success that by his medicines and exercise in less than four months time he recovered from all his indispositions and attained a strong lively and brisk habit o body  chap ii of vapors or hysteric fits their real cause and cure what i have said in the chapter before of hypochondriack melancholy gives some idea of the distemper i am now about to speak of though i am not of the opinion of sylvius and willis who allege that the difference between them is so little that they are taken to be one and the same i say i am not of their opinion because the same medicines that cure the one have no effect on the other and that because they affect different sexes from different causes though i must allow that there is an analogy between them in some symptoms and from some causes but yet so far from being general that it is but in some few particulars the symptoms of vapors or hysteric diseases being incident to the female sex chiefly in the manner men cannot have them and are so numerous that a day will scarce be sufficient to reckon them up  democritus in an epistle to hippocrates said that the womb was the cause of six hundred miseries and of innumerable calamities and among them reckons hysteric fits or vapors whence it is plain he concludes that they arise from a distemperature of the womb concerning which i shall by and by speak  the vapors or hysteric fits together with the hypochondriack disease are the most frequent of all chronick distempers the vapors few women are wholly free from more or less and those men that lead sedentary lives and study hard etc are commonly afflicted with hypochondriack melancholy  the vapors or hysteric fits are not only frequent to women but are so wonderfully various that they resemble almost all the diseases poor mortals are subject to for whatever parts they seat themselves in they presently produce such symptoms as belong to those parts when primarily affected with a real distemper as for instance if the vapors seize the head they produce some disorder or other there or if the spirits some violent commotions of mind are presently occasioned and so of the rest  this distemper is called the hysteric or uterine passion because the authors that first wrote about it thought that the womb was principally affected in it by reason it commonly invaded maids married women and widows both old and young which opinion is not fully agreed to though we cannot but say it is fomented and sustained by a fault that is in the womb as well as the other viscera which the curing it by medicines adapted to the womb demonstrates yet it principally proceeds from a fault in the blood and spirits injured by bad humors from cold ill food trash and the like which stagnating by the patients sedentary or idle life depraves the blood and gives it a bad disposition able to produce the hysteric passion of which by treating we mean not one but a whole army of distempers at least in outward show it being a disease that produces headachs giddiness convulsive motions palpitations of the heart rumblings and agitations of the stomach and guts difficulty of breathing hickup loss of senses both external and internal by which physicians speak of them under diverse heads though they be from one and the same cause  this distemper called vapors or hysteric passion in women is not always attended with the sam number of symptoms nor are the symptoms the same or equally violent in all for in some the suffocation and difficulty of breathing are but slight i others very severe therefore in describing the symptoms it is not to be understood that they are less the vapors because they have not all of them for some feel the symptoms as aforesaid in the head and there is giodiness swimming pain and the like in others the vital parts are affected which occasions so great a palpitation of the heart that the patient verily believes the bystanders may hear the sound of the heart thumping upon the ribs some it affects so as to cause coughing without intermission but they expectorate nothing sometimes the vapoury humors fall upon the parts between the stomach and bowels and occasion violent pain much like the illiack passion and cause the women to vomit a green matter like porraceous bile sometimes the spirits are so seized that the patient is oppressed with great anguish of mind and wholly dispairs of recovery with dejections and as it were a certain desperation sometimes this disease falls upon the kidneys and causes pain like the stone or stone cholick sometimes it falls on the bladder though seldom and stops the urine as if there was a stone there sometimes it falls upon the stomach and causes continual vomiting and sometimes upon the bowels and then a looseness follows but generally no pain accompanies either of these symptoms tho oftentimes in both the green humor aforementioned appears either by vomit or stool  and as this disease afflicts almost all the inward parts so sometimes it seizes all the outward parts and musculous flesh occasioning pain and sometimes a tumor in the jaws shoulders hands thighs and legs of which kind that tumor which swells he legs is more conspicuous than the rest but hese pains and swellings afflicting the outward parts chiefly seize those women that are in a manner quite destroyed by a long series and force of the vapors  but amongst all the torments of this disease there is none so common as a pain in the back which most certainly all women feel how little soever they are afflicted with the vapors it is also common that after the pains are gone off there is such a stiffness of the parts or numbness or soreness as if beaten so that the patient cannot bear to have the places touched but this tenderness goes off by degrees and this amongst the rest is worth observing that all hysteric women complain of a dejection and sinking of the spirits who when they would show the place where the sinking of the spirits is point to the region of the lungs  yet of all the symptoms that attend this disease nothing is more common or inseparable and more shows the patient to be troubled with vapors than that their urine is as clear as rockwater and comes away when they make it in a plentiful quantityespecially when they have just before found themselves faint ill or sickish moreover women much troubled with vapors belch up ill fumes as often as they eat though they only eat moderately and as they have an appetite also they sometimes in their fits laugh exceedingly and some times cry as much without any real cause for either  the efficient cause of this disease in my opinion proceeds from a confusion of the spirits the origin and antecedent cause of which confusion is the weak constitution of the spirits and genus nervosum and that weak constitution injured as before said is the cause of the many symptoms that are attending as we have in somewhat particular terms ennumerated  as to the prognostics this disease seldom kills the patient yet sometimes it snatches them away when the fit is intense and lasts very long or else draws on an apoplexy or syncope  of the several degrees of the vapors or hysteric fits that is the worst in which many parts suffer convulsions and the exercise of the senses is interrupted but that is slighter where the mind is untouched or the right use of it not taken away and but one or two parts are convulsed especially if the vital functions remain entire in ancient people it is hardly curable because in them the habit is contracted in young women it sometimes ceases of it self as they grow in years or when they begin to have chindren hysteric fits are dangerous to women with child and in childbed to the first for fear of miscarrying and to the last by reason of their weakness got in labor  the cure of the vapors is twofold in the fit especially when it is violent and of long duration and out of the fits to prevent their coming again authors to bring the patient out of the fit advise hard rubbing in the lower parts and scarification in the hips they recommend likewise the pulling out the hairs the twisting of the fingers the putting to the nose foeted things as assafaetida galbanum burnt feathers or leather brimstone lighted the smoke of tobacco spirit or salt of hartshorn armoniack sharp snuff of white hellebore euphobium or the like some of which have done and may do good when the fit is not very extreme but in all cases of desperation and also where the fit is not very violent because the sooner the patient is brought out of the fit the better i use my apoplectick species prescribed in the  th chapter aforegoing blowing a very little of it up each nostril which instantly brings the patient to her self that she is not so fatigued nor her spirits so worn or spent as they generally are if the fit continues for a long time this and this alone i have used times without number with all the success imaginable and therefore can and do with the more freedom recommend it it being i believe the only thing to save life where there is danger in any sudden fit of any kind in old or young  i was once called to a lady taken of a sudden with a fit of the vapors which she had been many years subject to though nothing near so violent as then several surgeons were instantly called as well as neighbors and friends who when they came thought she was dying some that she was dead no life or breath to appearance being left the surgeons bled her used oil of amber spirit of hartshorn and the like but nothing moved her i came after she was blooded and seeing her case and the consternation all about her were in immediately blew up into each nostril with a quill a little o my said apoplectick species it was not the tenth part of a minute after its use but she began t snort and a little while after to sneeze which brough her to herself forthwith though she had been almost a hour lifeless to all appearance and reported about to be dead after that i was desired to give he what i judged proper to prevent those fits for the future which i did as i shall presently relate an she never had any since it being now three year ago tho she was before many time in a year subjec to fits of the vapors more or less  entirely to cure vapors or hysteric fits authors direct long courses of many and various medcines and advise outward as well as inward applcations which i have observed very frequently to d more harm than good but i take these authors to be wrong in their fundamentals i mean as to the causes of the disease for if it proceeds from what i have a little before given my opinion it does a few medicines rightly adapted will cure and that the disease does proceed from those causes is evident by the success of the medicine i give which indeed is but one though compounded of several ingredients and that made up into pills which i call and rightly to my vapor pills for if a dose or two of them be but taken where there are any symptoms of the fits approaching or where there is any perturbation of the spirits they immediately dispel all those fuliginous vapors and raise the faint depressed spirits giving them such a turn that the patient is as brisk and well as if nothing at all had afflicted her and if they be taken continually three at night and three every morning for some time drinking two or three spoonfuls of wine or any other agreeable liquor after them they not only regulate and clear the spirits but amend and purify the blood and bring it to a due crasis though in constitutions much debilitated by the length of the disease i advise with them the german spawwater a flask every day which by diluting and washing off the peccant salts in the blood gives the vapor pills the better oom to extend their efficacy that by them and the other good qualities of that famed mineral water he patient amends every day getting health and strength apace for these pills powerfully regulate he spirits and strengthen them and the genus nerosum keep up the appetite rectify the blood conrm its tone and do all that is requisite to cure the distemper there not being i think i may be bold o say a better medicine or any other method to e advised to cure that disease so easily expeditiously and certainly they making the mind easy the head lightsome the spirits active and in short render the whole body so lively tranquil and free from all inquietudes and interruption that the patient becomes a new person to herself and all about her so that they will scarcely believe her to be the same  the vapor pills i speak of are these take winters bark zedoary roots galangal and cloves of each an ounce and half cinnamon and gentian roots of each six drams horseradish roots three ounces mustard seed two ounces calimint wormwood cammomile flowers of each an handful bruise all very small and digest them for a week in  decoction of white tartar and white

well in a mortar till they come to the consistency of a mass for pills which will be upon beatin em for a little while together and is then ready for vs three pills about the bigness of a large white pe each are a dose  the happy effects of those vapor pills which neither purge or disorder the body in the least i found in a late patient who was so extremely overwhelmed with the vapors that she was never well either in mind or body nor free from them a day together sometimes she would have flushing heats in her hands and face at other times cold sweats at other times a trembling all over her with weakness in her limbs that she could scarce walk sometimes pains in her head that she could not rise from her pillow all day othertimes she would fall into cryings fears dreads and ruminate on a thousand dismal things sometimes she would call out for help for that she was dying and could not live a minute and would be in a rage with those that told her there was no danger sometimes she would foollishly laugh at nothing all of a sudden and presently after cry sometimes rave scold and be angry at every thing sometimes she would be mute and not speak a word nor eat or drink in this condition which was very unhappy to all about her as well as to her self she took advice of many and was as she hoped sometimes better but her going through many courses for a long time to so little benefit tired out her husbands purse as well as her own person insomuch that they resolved to leave off and see what nature would do which alas was oo feeble to struggle through her difficulties which they seeing and by means of a certain lady whom  had before cured hearing of my vapor pills she ame as she said to talk with me despairing through er whole discourse of any help i ordered her o take my vapor pills which she did with reuctancy not believing they would do her any good and to drink the german spawwater with them which by her friends persuasions she consented to do and in less than three weeks time contrary to her faith she grew so well that in her own opinion she then believed she should be cured i advised her to proceed in the course which was nothing more than to take three of my vapor pills every night and morning and an hour after the morning dose to drink to flask of german spawwater taking two hours time for the drinking it by moderate draughts which is much better than to drink it too quick o too much at a draught which she did as i directed and used at the same time moderate exercise of walking and riding in a chaise as i advited for about nine weeks in which time she was perfectly recovered and was and is at the writing of this as completely well as if she had never been ill and this these vapor pills do and though they keep the body gently soluble yet comfort and strengthen the spirits and vitals being certainly the greatest alterative riviving refreshing medicine in those cases that is known  i could give diverse other instances of their wonderful effects but having exceeded the compass  intended to confine my self to and already ove swelled the magnitude of the book am obliged t come to a  finis advertisement all the medicines prescribed in
