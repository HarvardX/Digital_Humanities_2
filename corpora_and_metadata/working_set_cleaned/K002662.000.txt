four original letters viz two from a husband to a gentleman and two from a husband to a wife  in amore haec omnia insunt vitia   ut cum ratione insanias terent satis jam satis spectata erga te amicitia est mea id it is a kind of slander to trust to rumor b johnson the third edition  london printed for t read in dogwellcourt whitefryers mdccxxxix price sixpence  the preface he who in any station of life depends on the public cannot pay too great a deference or regard to em it is his interest and his duty from which motive alone the following letters are submitted to the perusal of the humane the sensible the candid and impartial the unhappy injured person who wrote em hopes they will be regarded as an opening only to a case to be published at a convenient opportunity wherein it is possible it will be made appear  however great a mans injuries  however aggravating the circumstances  it may not always prove the highest prudence to expect reparation from law since however excellent the laws may be however worthy and upright the  however wise and learned the  nay though a  should be wholly unbiasd or unprejudiced  what defense can there be against unsuspected treachery and a close laid conspiracy a series of which can be proved to have been acted a long time particularly by a set of the most unworthy ungrateful people that ever any one by marriage was unfortunately allied to against a man whose grossest crimes perhaps will appear to have been credulity indiscretion and a too forgiving temper  it may not be improper to premise the readers there is not a single fact hinted at in these letters that many living witnesses do not know to be truth and as to the marriage articles mentioned in em on their being examined by able lawyers they appeared to be not worth one shilling to the wife though they were drawn by a person chose by her own family whose trouble the husband handsomely rewarded the husband has scorned to take any bad advantage of em though it is evident they were never designed in his favor  the verdict in a past trial is not complained of twas all the money too much for the woman and more than the husband ever desired to receive though not equal perhaps as some may think to the damages and injuries the relations the friends the children and the creditors of that husband may have sustained by the cause of trial had the husbands views been mercenary there are many men of honor living who know a private composition was frequently proposed and as constantly rejected in a proper manner the readers are left to make their own remarks on the following epistles and only entreated to consider the different times and seasons they were wrote in as well as to allow for the agitations of the authors distracted mind and then if possible to suspend their final judgment till the whole is impartially stated and submitted to em and should it appear creditable witnesses are living who if called would have confronted the guilty and confuted many false scandalous and vile assertions made to the prejudice of the plaintiff what can be said or what may not be thought as the author of these is well known and ready on occasion to appear and as they contain truth alone it is left to the consideration of the impartial reader what sort of countenance or belief ought to be given to any libels published as pretended answers should any such appear as has been too frequently and basely practiced against many dispersed by unknown hands  should the husband in time recover his senses enough even to smile at the romantic stuff and sublime nonsense he in his extravagance of frantic passion may when wandering abroad have wrote to the wife at home  nay should he hereafter endeavor to divert others with what may have made him too long serious it is hoped twill not be imputed to him as any breach of good manners or morality if there are any such severe grave thinkers he humbly begs leave to say to em with the philosophical satirist ridentem dicere verum quis vetat but to detain the readers no longer the following pages are left to their censure or approbation with this intimation alone  nothing but the last necessity should have occasioned the printing of what was meant for a private perusal only they were not when wrote designed for public view etc but flowed from the weakness of his blind infatuation and passionate wounded heart whose cooler judgment now convinces him the persons they are addressed to deserved not a single line from him  letter i a letter from the husband to the wife once thought virtuous left for her in her servants hands the day before the husband went abroad which was on sunday april the   th      she having confessed her love for another  my dearest susanna maria not strength of constitution spirits resolution reason or all i can call to my assistance will i find prevent my having a violent fit of illness which increases daily if god pleases to dismiss me this life it will be an act of mercy my heart trembles my senses stagger what a state of despair i own the hand of providence and submit to its eternal justice my condition is greatly terrible my own faults glare upon me and self convicted i own i ought to suffer much yet sure mine is the heaviest calamity that ever oppressed human nature how vain were an attempt to express it in words it is not to be conceived it is only to be felt and felt by me alone  where is the religion where the unspotted truth the whitened innocence that once shone out so brightly in a certain mind all lost i hope not irrecoverably lost in violent passions and wild notions that impose upon the understanding and mislead the mind benighted till the day may break and waken us from cheating dreams to certainty of pain  i have broke off to address the almighty with a truly penitent contrite heart with bitter tears unfeigned sorrow do you join in the prayer humbly implore that great divine instructor to illuminate your mind to waken a sense of truth and convince that without such assistance our own reason is too weak to let us know when we err the indulgence of strong passions will never permit us to judge heartily how necessary is it to beg grace of the divine power to do it fervently and unfeignedly it is the only true check on our wrong thoughts that otherwise lead us to wrong actions one brings on another it is impossible to avoid it if not timely stopped how dismal are my nights how miserable my days oh child be cautious lest too late you own with me it is a bitter aggravating circumstance of sorrow to be conscious our follies may in some measure have deserved it may the just the allgracious god hear and be my witness since i was married that i never thought of any one with the ideas of love but my own dear wife whom now i love with all the esteem tenderness cordial affection and fond concern that ever possessed the breast of man as a husband or lover no parent not even a mother can more fondly dote on her only newborn child that i have been heretofore negligent of my person my fortune and character with shame and sorrow i own and god only knows how terrible my punishment he farther knows and may his gracious unbounded mercy strengthen my mind to an honest resolution he also knows i say how desirous i am of being just for the time to come i will not encourage the least contrary thought nor omit ought may lead me to that happiness may my crimes be pardoned as i pardon all committed toward me would the indulgent omnipotent recall the dear wandering heart whose loss i mourn with agony be witness god with what a rapture my heart would open to receive the blessing and never in a single thought would dare to reprove or chide the too dear frail one heaven grant this or i am lost for ever  my hearts fondling my dearest molly you may have the sole possession and full command of the heart of a husband that beats to you alone that wishes the vital blood may no longer warm it than while it flows for you take example of heaven and dash not away the tears of penitence i have been highly too blame and i as truly repent i will err no more i here give up all views of idle pleasures all vanities whatsoever i will live very near that i may recover my circumstances i give up every thing but your heart let me recover that treasure and i shall repine at nothing my heart will be delighted in ecstasy while i can see your countenance smile and wear the looks of cordial affection  return and save me from the last misery my senses will certainly be lost if not my life unless this happens human nature cannot support it long sure you will you will return i must not suppose you could bear to think you were unhappily the cause of my untimely end and thereby hazard my souls eternal rest all right of command i change to entreaty and fondly implore this of you no indulgence shall equal mine and think how glorious the triumph will be when humanity and virtue conquers unwarrantable passions it is the greatest progress we can make toward reaching divine perfection such a victory is a nobler instance of a great mind than can be given by those who never had struggle on one side appears comfort and everlasting happiness warranted and protected by the laws of god and man on the other i dare not paint it the prospect is too indelicate for me to show you and too terrible for us both to look at i must though with a bleeding heart say something though very poorly expressive of the truth is it not for the present indulgence of unjustifiable passions and deceiving pleasures is it not hoarding up of perpetual miseries to come minds may change resentments may awake unforeseen revolutions may happen and shame and scorn ensue truth will conquer all you are high in the esteem of the best lose it not for gods sake think of your days of innocence and delight awake the memory of those joys those conscious joys we have known return return entire and give a joy beyond em all crown the evening of my life with this blessing and have my eternal prayers experience will teach us bread and water with such reflections afford greater delight than all the nameless vanities that luxury in all its deceitful shapes can give such cannot last and misery must be the consequence revive the memory of your own dear innocence let not false names cheat you to mistake something for it that is not it save my life save my soul and of a miserable object of despair make me the happiest of men my heart springs at the thought but alas it sinks again and swells with throbbing grief to think it is not so yet let me hope it though  if nothing but my everlasting ruin can content you you may soon enjoy the sacrifice but have more regard to yourself your relations your friends and the aching heart of a forgiving a repentant and truly affectionate husband think how you have been delighted to see my name joined thereto and by blessing me beyond expression renew those delights such as will give our hearts more lasting real joy than all we can propose beside had god permitted our tender babes to have remained on earth those innocent angels would have pleaded in my behalf beyond the rhetoric of man much more beyond all my poor disconcerted brain will enable me to say i would proceed but big passions choke me i have been torn by many but my love and concern for you conquers all  let me not imagine any thing can entirely efface the memory of a husband whom you own you entertained as the first welcome guest of an innocent heart let no second thought for gods sake drive me quite from thence you know my esteem of you is so great so fond my opinion of you my tender heart has been more ready to form excuses for you than you to make em  my dear affliction is a just though severe monitor the sincerest friend it shows the truth i see i feel it to declare i lose my appetite that i want sleep are but poor instances of pain i want much more i want my peace of mind you alone can restore it kneel kneel and implore the assistance of our great creator to trust alone to our fallible mind is running on in error it leads to perdition be assured this is so and may the almighty power waken you to a right sense ever mine is lost in madness my prospects otherwise are these a lingering death in a jail madness in bedlam a broken heart or the terrible chance that in some frensy of my passion i may at once rush into that eternity of which the wisest man is but an arrogant fool who presumes he can give a full and certain notion and then where is my retreat from all this you and you alone can save me the recovery of thee my inestimable jewel would give a transport to my heart beyond all i ever knew that were a bridal hour indeed then my mind might calm to give me leave to look into my affairs which if this happens are not irretrieveable but one cannot be without the other my horses and all superfluities belonging to me i shall order to be sold i am determined to think nothing necessary but what may merely keep me clean and subsist me and shall employ one among my creditors who shall make such reasonable proposals as i cannot but think will be complied with if riding is necessary for you as i think it may i can have your little mare or borrow some other for you and you cannot have a faithfuller servant than myself to attend you give me my peace of mind give me yourself give me your heart  your mind my souls darling my only comfort and remaining hope and what cannot i undertake and accomplish with his great assistance whose aid i shall frequently implore the repetition of which you well know is the only way to keep our mind in a right habit let not false notions glossd over with specious appearances win you from these thoughts i would be delicately tender of shocking your mind with rude images yet duty compels me gently to inform you in the way you are you are trying to steal your heart against a fond though erring husband but a truly penitent one it is driving from your mind all conjugal affections setting at naught the peace of all relations all friends and risquing your own eternal quiet it is teaching yourself a strange unhappy lesson it is plunging in guilt believe it oh god it is fearing your conscience midst all the calamities and disappointments you ever met examine your mind and tell me did there not appear great solace from the consciousness of a well disposed and warrantable inclination and gave not religion a comfort which naught else can so effectually do i have been too well acquainted with the volence of some passions and know how much they blind our reason but truth will prevail at last and when we find that has not been our guide how shocking our condition your truest friend tells you this who knows it by sad experience profit by the example the struggle will over pay itself ah my life i wish not to cure the wounds of your dear mind with corrosives i would pour the balm of comfort though i am mentioning what is a dagger in my heart but thy kind hand can remove it and i will draw a veil over it that the operation may not too strongly affect you think this  justice honor duty all the ties of religion virtue truth and humanity plead my unhappy cause your not complying ends in the ruin of all it must end in mine and which to me appears still worse i fear your own destruction i here in express terms declare what is passed i forgive and nothing but the prevention of my future ease shall ever rouse a thought of it in me nor do i desire a better security for my quiet than your own word be assured all unwarrantable passions are to be got the better of with much more ease and less time than those which virtue inspires which honor warrants which truth demands and which it is unjust to waver in but more heinous not to recover to cherish and support wiser heads than mine may dress up other sentiments in a more pleasing garb but time alone will convince there is nothing so charming however other things may be artfully disguised as simple naked truth i have begged of god and i hope he has heard my prayers to enable me to suppress all passion but one that one ought to be indulged my love i mean again i repeat it  i will show no ill will or resentment to any no thought but what terminates in an honest desire of making my dear wife happy wife and husband are the tenderest names do not lose all sense of em retrieve me from perdition my hearts darling and be in a true literal sense my guardian angel read this often consider it cooly and though a moderate understanding may make me express myself but indifferently it speaks my mind at least drive me not to despair insult not my breaking heart but my dearest sucky my dearest molly my dearest teresa return to truth and bless me return to  your repentant fond forgiving affectionate tender truly loving though unhappy husband tc  letter ii a letter from the husband in town to a gentleman once thought a friend delivered into his own hands in the country by a man servant the latter end of august       sir though the occasion of my writing to you is the most extraordinary that ever was i shall come to the point without ceremony a certain fine lady whose name i never choose to mention again will by that time you have this receive a letter to inform her of my determined resolution as to herself something remains to be said to you sir i must forget i ever looked on you with a friendly eye or as a gentleman whom perhaps i once greatly esteemed and thought myself honored in acquaintance how i ought to think of you or act toward you now sir let your own understanding determine for me in spite of prejudice to me or your own selflove i must now change the style i have often talked to you in but i shall be calm though determinate and as i scorn to speak beneath a gentleman you need not apprehend ought unfitting a gentleman to hear reflect sir how much ruin i owe to the most deceitful of women and what shall i call you sir the most artful of men can you have so strong a sense of pride and shame as you say you have and not blush when you reflect how much you have made me the unhappiest of men you know you have by my g  d you do you have seen me sinking under the most calamitous heartfelt anguish and agony while i smothered passions in my breast that disordered my senses and were near depriving me of life i blush to think i have endured so much but nothing less than extremes could have cured me of that excessive that uncommon i must now add shameful love that i once had for the unworthiest of women  i cannot say less of her and scorn to say more i own i have often debated with myself whether i should not have destroyed you her and myself i have had it in my power could i have reconciled my mind to so damned so execrable an action i am not ashamed to avow sir i believe in a god and think selfmurder the most impudent crime can be committed toward him though i have had too many melancholy debates with myself thereon nay i think it indeed in one sense a cowardly act my farther thoughts on that subject i have no need to explain now  as to her i could not bear the idea of hurting what was once too dear too precious to me i will not say now how much so and for you sir let me tell you while i had the least interval of reason i could not but scorn a base malicious resentment even to the man who has deprived me of all i once thought valuable i have had my cure from her own flagrant behavior but i will not be so meanly ungenerous to say all i think of her to you do you think of her ingratitude to say the least toward me as a high merit to you if the strongest guilt can deserve a favorable thought you owe it to her  sir i must tell you plainly i know now i believe the whole progress of a detested affair even from the masquerade and chapel meetings you had long since yes sir and the dear ladys beginning a literary correspondence at a time when i believe i may safely call god to witness i had never exchanged three words with you nay barely recollected your face and scarcely remembered your name you must know and ought to own this i thank the delicate dame for the commencement of our acquaintance i am lost in astonishment when i recollect i have seen that innocent face of here is as it once appeared to me received ay both of us received on a friendly footing in a sober family of distinction and reputation where there appeared a general harmony of love and friendship  she handsomely treated by gentlemen of figure and fortune invited and caressed by ladies of deserved reputation placed by the side of one whom i shudder to think of and will not be so indelicate to dwell on em in my thought least my imagination should start strange fancies i say i am stunned at the recollection with what innocent mirth she there appeared when my god how shockingly far gone was she in guilt as her own confessions have since revealed to me but from herself i could not have believed it my brain achs with the thought by all that is sacred i then no more imagined her capable of what i have since found than i thought infants at the breast could lay schemes of mischief or that babes in the month could blaspheme so foolishly was i lost in a high opinion of her i never had the least suspicion of her being capable of an error even in thought till a damned letter i received a considerable time after the queens death and even then struggled to think favorably till her own mouth pronounced her guilty the consequence of which immediately drove me from england and what cruel shocking artful advantages were taken of my distracted mind during my absence as well as of my weakness credulity and unhappy circumstances  when at home let them say whose consciences can best inform em  but i have said too much of you and her though i may owe it to myself to say a great deal more she is not worth it now had i any obligations to you sir that i did not propose returning in the strongest manner were they not unexpectedly thrust on me did i ever seek for any if by any accident it has not been immediately in my power to discharge em let me say twas a cruel artful manner of deluding me with what i ought all things considered to call the appearance of obligations only it is plain they were meant to disarm me of that resentment you were conscious i must some time or other waken to yet she she that strange woman whom i cannot name taught me to call you a friend and think you such were you really one sir let me tell you sir those in whom i thought i could place the highest confidence have disappointed and betrayed me where i centered my hopes of happiness i have met with shame ingratitude and ruin how very early attempts were made against my peace of mind and all that is valuable to man is best known to those who took strange methods cooly and deliberately to plan my destruction though i scorn as i have told you more than once a base low malicious treacherous revenge yet i am compelled to inform you whatever man ought to do i dare do sir let the trial come when it will though perhaps it is scarce courage to say after being stabbed through the heart you are welcome to a fair opportunity of shooting me through the head or running me through the body if your own honor your own conscience your own understanding dictate to you more should be said or done by one in my tortured unhappy condition think it said already and save me the pain of repeating words that bear a harsh sound to one whom friendship respect and good will have not permitted me to look on hatefully though i am through your means the most undone of mankind i expect sir as you are a man of honor to have all my letters returned me that i wrote to her since among other modest treatment of me she has hinted to me they were in safe hands i may pardon her breach of duty in other respects and plead her unhappy love forsooth which i ought to laugh at now but i never will forgive such an injurious sacrilegious breach of trust i shall lose all patience if i say much more on it i wont meanly imagine you could desire to have em sir what expose the letters of an injured forgiving husband wrote when god is witness he had not the right use of his senses stupendous impudence had an unhappy man been afflicted with a leprosy and in a delirious fit of a fever danced naked round his chamber should a wife a wife sir dare to throw open the door to expose him damned thought but not parallel to the exposing of letters full of the wild ravings and incoherent starts of an unfortunate madman sir i must require every line of em from you and may i never see her face again i am not to direct you sir how you are to behave to others or ask you whom you may hurt besides myself but i cannot help saying if she has any spark of honor conscience honesty or modesty remaining she ought to retire from the world contented with a very moderate allowance which i shall be willing to contribute to sir loaded as i am with distresses and difficulties and i shall still think worse of her than i have done if she takes any advantage of her power over you i know she has shown a great deal too much already to drive you to ought that may prejudice you or hurt some families that good manners and humanity will not permit me to mention or dwell one moment longer on sir as she has chose her situation when i to the last moment would have saved her from the last ruin i never more will exchange a word with her if you have ought after the receipt of this to say to me sir i am to be found in town whither you can better afford to come than i to take a journey into the country which as i have been exceeding ill is not altogether so easy for me neither though i think it highly improper we should ever more behold each other unless it were on an affair of the last consequence though she had impudence and folly enough to think i would continue on any consideration of luxury or vanity to play the ridiculous infamous part of a feigned husband sure no man in his senses thought i would or could if you know such a one sir tell em i can teach myself to think as cheaply as badly of them as they must of me favors of any sort i neither expect or want or would receive i should detest those who could proffer em as i should myself to accept em and without mincing the matter sir i must tell you my acquaintance with you has been the most expensive of any i ever had perhaps i mean so in a literal sense for i have ever been too apt to appear and act above myself both at home and abroad and never omitted in every respect entertaining others in the manner i thought they deserved i now will have done and subscribe myself as youre a gentleman  your humble servant ps i have been in some hurry of business and perhaps my mind not a little ruffled therefore cannot yet finish my other letter but i shall send it to her as soon as possible on second thoughts i care not whether i have my letters or no provided the weakness i have shown in em toward a nameless woman is not believed let her rather think it artifice or call it what she will i am not to learn your spirit and your sentiments of pride and honor sir therefore will not doubt but my name will never be mentioned by you this is no time for either of us to give or receive compliments but be assured from this time your name sir will never be mentioned more by me for my own sake and i wish my own name were changed because she once bore it whatever others may advise me to do i have determined to act from myself and i here tell you sir the only appearance of an obligation i will ever owe to you shall be your assistance and that at a a distance to free me from what i scorn to be linked to if it will be any additional gratification to the lady to have her husband destroyed dont fail to obey her commands sir for who can do too much to please such a dame but know sir least you should imagine i would reap ought from her damned folly i here declare i seek for nothing but to be free and so farewell to her for ever it is incumbent on me to tell you sir what obligations she may be under to you by g  d i am an utter stranger to and wish for ever to continue so my humble service to her and i thank her and you for my ruin which i shall rise above when she is repenting too late she will find me a fatal prophet when she has received and read my letters i stand prepared for all events as i have been her slave to extremes let her not be surpised that my resentments rises in proportion though the insolent fool has often dared to rouse my anger to my face i scorned the violence she would have provoked me to and could not forget i was a man though i had been excusable not to have remembered she was a woman i shall say nothing but truth in my letters to her though exceeding short of what i know if men of honor are to be depended on and far far short of what she has deserved i must remind you sir whatever lie i cannot use a softer word she has taught herself to tell or has imposed on any one to believe i know how to clear myself in spite of all her base attempts i insist on her earrings i have been robbed too much by her already    letter iii the foregoing letter was enclosed in the following  sir the enclosed has been wrote a considerable time and sent after you twice when by accident i heard you was in town i can but smile to think you could suppose i ever wanted to make any advantages of you to your prejudice had that ever been my thought i might have proceeded very differently  no sir i would starve first a divorce a thorough one i have learnt is not so excessively expensive as some may have imagined i expect that of their honor who ought to procure it and it may be done without prejudice to any or using names that may shock the innocent it is all i want in lieu of a fine lady and her income which by my means may yet be  00 l a year but i would beg rather than share it with her i think money dirt sir as much as any one and however necessary an article it is in life i scorn to pick it off dunghills pray sir what favors do i owe you except one paltry debt for which you had my bond and you know might have had stronger security did i dream of it ever twas proffered or were any damned terms proposed no by my g  d sir you know the contrary i am sir as before  yours  letter iv a letter delivered by a man servant into the wifes own hands she being then in the country wrote when the husband was just recovered from a violent fit of illness by the kind care and assistance of a friend at whose house he lodged being the last the husband ever did or ever will write to the wife delivered the beginning of september       madam i am about to write to you for the last time consequently may be drawn into a long letter as i purpose never more but once to set my hand to ought concerning you i mean by that once when i may sign an instrument that may leave you to all that liberty your own licentiousness has made choice of  you know some time ago i bid you prepare for a determined separation which resolution no consequence upon earth shall shake remember it is your own seeking  twas your own choice at a time when i was running distracted and breaking my heart abroad for what i blush to have ever set so much value on your behavior and my own reflections have fixed my mind irrevocable those who act thoughtlessly may in some measure stand accused  but he who continues to act against his thought is i think unpardonable  i am greatly at a loss to proceed since what can i say to you that will not be shocking though i shall say nothing but truth unless i were to demean myself if possible more than i have done so much have i been lost in love and a fond foolish hope of recovering what i ought not to have sought after which love you have torn from my heart by the roots yes madam entirely though i once loved to folly and madness my only obligation to you is you have absolutely cured me which not long since i thought could never have happened i think a generous goodnatured mind should be slow to suspect as humanity will be ready to forgive how mine have been deceived i have been too surely convinced by undeniable facts and the confessions gained from yourself however wildly i may often have appeared in general to have acted yet in matters of the highest consequence you may have had some proof i can be strangely steady can keep my mind to myself can sift to the very bottom of things am slow in my determination and being fixed no power no force no threat no bribe no terror nor any temptation whatever can alter me knowing my resolves are grounded on truth honor and justice but to my point  when i made you my wife i knew i wedded a beautiful sensible young woman but what i farther thought an inestimable treasure was i imagined i had found one of a deserved good character whose prudence whose religion whose artless innocence whose careful sober education whose sound principles and steady honesty were such as nothing could tempt to any act or even thought that was in the least repugnant to the strictest principles of truth and virtue i need not say i have been vilely deceived in all  but when i reflect how much and how early i was deceived  i am astonished and thunderstruck though i can i thank god speak of it now with temper  to say ought that may appear like praise of ones self may seem vain but there can be no reason in the world why we should fear to speak a simple truth when so absolutely necessary to remember it nay when the occasion seems indeed to extort it from one  being conscious to myself that i had been too irresolute in the conduct of my affairs as to economy etc i acted with that nicety that extravagance of honor toward you madam that by my own desire marriage articles were drawn to make you mistress of whatever fortune might accrue to you from your own talents etc which income you have received and had the free undisputed disposal of though by the way you did not bring me a shilling and twas almost impossible you should ever get one without my conduct my care assistance instruction and advice  what they have been you know full well  what anxiety i have endured what assiduity what diligence i have used what uncommon means to support you i have hazarded friendships made myself even a public jest set my own interest at naught my life and reputation at stake and thought all too little i am sorry i have occasion to mention your poor unfortunate family but as distress is no crime i shall venture to remind you from an uncommon regard to you i thought of their interest and support even to the prejudice of my own and omitted enlarging my own income at a critical juncture to promote theirs in a handsome manner as i preferred obliging you and all that belonged to you to all considerations upon the face of the earth let me acknowledge they have not yet appeared ungrateful at the time this was wrote their ingratitude etc had not appeared in the glaring colors it has since whatever you have been  nor will i say they had any obligation to me since you were the source of all  i acknowledge my error and blush at my want of conduct when i say so much i prided in you that i thought no expense too much that supported what i must now call your pride and vanity i had almost said your vices harsh terms perhaps though far short of what you might expect from me and very different from any yet ever used by me toward you though laboring under the highest indignities and injuries human nature ever suffered  and those brought to the highest pitch when i was under the greatest distresses  thank you madam  was i expensive in my dwelling in town and country was my equipage above me my table too open to friends were not your friends your guests ever the most welcome was i too lavish in many articles what were my expenses on myself at home or abroad moderate less than they had often been why did e not retrench all because my fondness and pride would not let me while you were my partner and presided as mistress of all  my pleasurable jaunts were all with you  who ever shared any with me except yourself no creature on the face of the earth  i ever chose you should share my cheerful moments and which i own was a fault kept all painful thoughts to myself rather than let em disturb you  did i ever want good humor good manners or goodnature love fondness or tenderness you know i have shown em to excess ay felt em to excess  a shameful one  nor was my love so sickly to diminish by fruition but rather  increase of appetite did grow by what it fed on yes madam i have on some occasions shown uncommon instances of a raptured husband this you know your soul knows it  but i forgot among other refined notions your improved talents have gained your having a soul seems to be a doubt with your philosophical ladyship who have learned to make a jest of all ties human and divine  those lessons madam i never taught you  oh but say you  you all this while forget your own errors  no madam i have often in my confession of em rather enlarged than lessened em been quick to arraign myself  reflected strongly and truly repented would have amended would you have encouraged me this you know to be truth as is every word i say to you i never thought i could do enough by way of expiation  conscious of my follies i have in return hushed my resentments struggled with my pride and honor  but what is the pride of a poor man or the honor of a husband does not your witty wanton ladyship smile at em  take care let me never more see it though  have i not excused the frailties of others convinced of my own to an unpardonable fault i have soothed when i should have been severe have sighed when i should have raged have forced a smile under the greatest affliction have used entreaty for command have seemed blind with my eyes open though they were opened very lately god knows and then i wished i could not see i have continued the lover when i should have asserted the husband and rather chose by tenderness to touch the heart i valued than force myself contrary to my nature to be a tyrant or a jailor  i ever scorned to possess what generosity and confidence could not preserve  and that you might not blush too much if you would have repented i even framed excuses for your errors and chose to load myself with blame rather than not alleviate your burden  to flatter you to truth i have thrown faults on myself i have not been guilty of and allowed you merits that you never had  when i went to france though twas my own unhappy sudden thought you know you drove me thither  i sink with shame though no eye beholds me when i recollect how near i was losing my senses nay let me truly own i had lost em because i thought i had lost you the symptoms were too plain to every eye while my fond fears for you endeavored to conceal the real cause i own i wished to be recalled why because england held you  the only person in the world that now makes me wish i had a fortune abroad dont imagine that by the repetition of ought i may have done or endured i expect or wish your mind should return to me and a wife without it were such infamy as i scorn to dwell on  my affluence you were pleased to share the narrowness and hazardous part of my circumstances you were above condescending to partake though with your comfort and that assistance you ought to have lent me nay and which i could command i had no affairs but were to be retrieved and the difficulties that have arose have been more owing to my distracted state of mind etc on your account than any other impediment i thought my going abroad would either wean me or recall you i hoped my return would operate on you in such a manner as humanity and a consciousness of error should have taught  but you force me to say you tear the words from me sure never was mind so lost so abandoned amidst all the uncommon agonies and terrors i endured i was resolved to try you to the uttermost and use various and uncommon means to gain the truth if possible  but by sifting that from you how false how prevaricating how very base have i proved you or rather you proved yourself thou thorough liar it is not to be dwelt on i thought i knew the world pretty well your sex not a little but you madam have made all that knowledge nothing nor do i believe any age or history can readily furnish one with your parrallel i thank providence that prompted me to return to find the bottom of you without it i had been lost in pity compassion and delusion for what i will not say all i think of you your cunning artifice your strange conduct in having private meetings long since and all unsuspected by me at chapels masquerades and places that shock me to think of and your slow and sly manner of drawing me into an intimacy an acquaintance and friendship and scheming my being under obligations have made me start but now i could almost smile at em and all this ere i had the least imagination or suggestion that you either had suffered or would suffer any one to whisper a single accent of love in your ear nay before i knew a certain person had even in public or private ever exchanged a syllable with you thou strange strange creature never had man greater confidence nor was ever confidence more ungenerously betrayed than mine has been your presuming to lay a plan for our living together on such audacious terms as you could propose makes me shudder to think you could utter em while i smile at your ridiculous folly that could suppose i would go through with it i choose to smile madam because i scorn to be angry with what is become beneath my resentment you have chose strange extremes madam and i thank god those extremes have cured me madam no consideration upon earth shall ever make me again eat a meal with you nor sleep under the same roof nor dare to think i will ever have the least obligation or friendship from you your lip or hand i never more will offer to touch and all i expect of you is good manners and distance if ever we are compelled by any accident to meet again though i own i could wish we were never more to see each other i shall talk to you madam by a third person only whom i shall pitch upon with caution what is proper for you to wear madam you shall have but i have no fortune to compliment away and have enough to do with that little that extreme little that belongs to me i once thought it an honor to call you by my name  guess what i think it now however slight or lowly you have taught yourself to think of me you will find i have resolution enough yet to act with strict justice and honor to all who ought to expect or demand it from me wakened from my unhappy lethargy of love recollection now awakens to my memory innumerable instances long since past of your mercenary selflove deceit and baseness of mind toward me that had remained unheeded but for some shocking provocations which recall the remembrance of em and justify me in a strong belief rather let me say assurance you never meant to act justly by me or ever was what i once fondly thought you i now can see through you clearly madam  when i cast my eyes over your letters i can point out the places where a superior understanding to your own was the dictator and what shocks me to think of is even the feeling the humanity or tenderness toward me that may appear in em i am now convinced was art those feigned sentiments came not from your heart i am certain i rather owed em to another  shocking aggravating circumstance of your guilt and folly you artfully kept alive my love to take advantage of my weakness base wretch can i on reflection think otherwise what signifies your words when your actions have spoke you too plain to me how readily you caught at my words when i proposed going abroad to remove a painful object from your eyes the ceremony indeed appeared to shock you  why alas my fond credulity then misinterpreted all but now i will tell you the true reasons madam and god forgive me if i injure you you were hurt not from what i was to suffer but from the hazards you ran yourself your pride began to be alarmed lest you should lose that reputation your virtue should have deserved twas undoubtedly no pleasant circumstance to think of me only in the light of a companion that had often added to your entertainment and mirth to see a man bursting with agony yet endeavoring to support himself with spirit turning his back on his native country with a thought of never beholding it more nor was it agreeable to see my furniture thrown in a heap designed for sale which it never should have been but that i knew not otherwise till i could fix some scheme or resolution how to support myself abroad unless i had been as low in my mind as your simple ladyship was pleased to think me and would have submitted to have owed my support where i would sooner have sacrificed my life how dared you madam to have such an audacious insulting thought of me if i dwell on it i shall lose my temper and talk beneath myself you know my little support was from myself alone i will suppose at that juncture too your conscience stirred within you and moved your countenance to such expressive looks as even now i cannot bear the thought of and i must pause ever i can go on  curse on the weakness that stops me i ought while i talk to you to divest myself of all feeling and humanity of memory if possible yet let me recollect you let me go and madam spite of your art spite of all disguise i could find by your writing your mind felt a relief the moment you heard i was landed on another shore how unhappy my life was there i scorn to tell you now but how were you alarmed when i thought of returning when you pretended i had like to have said impudently you would live with me again if i pleased but the conditions were so pretty i must laugh madam lest a just anger should waken me to terms i scorn to use though all would be far short of your deservings you who could pretend to be in your senses and dare to think so damnably of me i must break off for how can i go on is it a subject to smile at monstrous after all i have endured should i revive any soft ideas in my memory twere the extreme of folly shall i be angry i owe more to my own pride than to think you worth it i find such variety of thoughts pour in upon me i must determine to hasten to a conclusion or this subject will be endless whatever may remain to be said i shall think of and deliver elsewhere  to the point  had you listened to me as you ought god who knows my heart well knows your usage should have been worthy a better woman but as you choose the hazard of being called the mistress of a married man rather than to live the wife of an honest though unhappy husband take your choice and be certain i should think it more honorable to be the lowest person in a jail than command in a palace on such terms as your insolent folly i cannot say less has more than once hinted to me  i have tried you madam to the uttermost and you must surely be astonished at my temper as i have at your behavior i owed it to myself to remember you were a woman though the most insolent provoking wife perhaps that ever tried the strength of a husbands temper love or reason  my reason i have often been near being entirely deprived of on your account but it is past  and my love completely cured  i was determined to go through any fiery trial to accomplish it or to tear out the heart that could continue in the weakness  and so no more on it  articles of separation shall be drawn consult whom you please on your part  were i a man of fortune they should be more than articles  let the expense be what it would  not that i want or wish to throw any odium or malicious insult on you or any one i am above it  i have spirit enough to smile under misfortunes and scorn the injuries i have not deserved  those articles i mention madam ought to leave each as free as we were once fast if possible  nor is it reasonable i should be liable to a jail for the indiscretions of others whom i am compelled to say may not a little have contributed toward the hazard of my being in one  i can make it appear you have spent me infinitely more than your own income ever amounted to  while i have been endeavoring to lessen my expenses your ladyships have increased  your wardrobe etc since you were my wife was much properer for one of a superior rank and fortune  yet let me hint to you i bought your weddingsuit madam  to enumerate all articles were as endless as to endeavor to relate all your monstrous behavior  in answer to a damned lie you i am informed have taught your horrid tongue for which god save thee receive the following questions  could i teach you pretty miss to love a man i did not know and whom you brought me acquainted with impudent stupidity  could i give you wrong inclinations or was i to be delighted with distraction mad woman  dear precious madam say that or any other damned foolish vile thing rather than suppose i ever loved you  for i detest the remembrance  my few remaining goods etc i must part with for i am ashamed to say it to you but i am in danger of being troubled by some few creditors whose folly has refused my honest proposals and my whole salary you know must go to those goodnatured creditors who have complied though they are all yours madam as much as mine at least  i cannot throw away any thing where i am sure there is no obligation  nor must my children starve while you riot  and give me leave to tell you madam my heart can never be easy or my spirit at rest while i am conscious i am under an obligation that i have not at least a prospect of returning  my mind was ever above it for you know madam even any bill that was delayed being paid by my casual extravagance i have only looked on the sum total and paid to the last farthing rather than not make up for the time they waited  nay i have paid you whatever i borrowed of you by accident since my return as punctual as if you were a stranger  but i ramble from my purpose  you may madam if you please have i understand full the same terms you had the last year at the theater which will amount to at least  00 l for the season  i only inform you of it  i undertake to give you no advice or sentiments of mine thereon  but to tell you whatever you can gain any where is entirely your own for i would sooner swallow poison than touch a shilling of it  and i desire it may without loss of time be out of my power to expect it  you must imagine madam i could say an infinite deal more on this subject  but i will not give myself the pain  only this and i have done  remember my humanity would have saved you even when i had conquered my love  and now  may you be as true to another as you have been false to me  and may you find that pardon of god that you have from me but may you deserve it more or dare not to hope for it  for in a few words toward me you have been  vain proud illtemperd and extravagant  shocking to my humanity  destructive of my peace of mind  ungrateful to my friendship which served you and yours in the greatest need ought i to forgive that  have scandalously betrayed my confidence  have reproached me with my former extravagance when my fortune was at the lowest ebb  though at the same time you drew me into additional expenses  been shamefully false and perfidious to my love  have imposed on my goodnature  unjust to every trust i reposed in you  insulted my breaking heart  trampled on my pride and honor  been shamefully neglectful of your duty in every article  and when you reflect on your whole unparalled behavior since my return you may wonder that you live  but you cannot be surpised that here i vow to god never will i more hold converse or commerce with you on any account whatever  fearing your welfare in my absence i wrote letters in your praise to recommend you to the care of my father and others when i should have been justifiable had i abandoned you to ruin  yet at the same time you traduced me to my father thou honest grateful creature  one word more  as you have endeavored when i was under the greatest misfortunes to blacken me to my nearest and dearest friends and relations for so i find pray keep your modest face out of my sight  though you have boasted of the power you maintained over all that ever loved you yet i will give you one friendly piece of advice  should you ever meet with any man of no ordinary sense pride and spirit take care to behave a little better than you have to me  the person who writes the copy of my letter is bound by solemn oath to secresy and silence  that you might be sure twas a true copy i have numbered every page and signed it myself  and be assured i am my own dictator madam  i never have deceived you but when the madness of my passion deceived my unhappy self  you know it  too well you know it  i wrote to another person with my own hand  because i remembered he was a gentleman  twas scarce worth my while to you who are  nothing  on this subject i shall never write word more or open my lips i wish i could lose the thought   after all i know of you  be any thing but my wife and be luxuriously happy if you can  hell seize me if i wish to interrupt you  and so thou weakest and most worthless of thy sex farewell for ever  teach yourself no more to be called my wife for never never will i more if possible think myself your husband  i will have no answer to this  there can be none fit for you to give or me to receive  and i wish you may never remember there is such a person in the world as the unjustly treated highly injured  tc  finis nb these letters had been offered to the public much sooner had not some booksellers and printers been intimidated from publishing em one in particular by some means was alarmed even to the breaking of the press when the whole was completely composed and ready to be worked off
