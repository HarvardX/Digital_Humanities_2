notes on virginia continued     query xii a notice of the counties cities townships and villages the counties have been enumerated under query ix they are    in number of very unequal size and population of these    are on the tide waters or in that parallel    are in the midlands between the tide waters and blue ridge of mountains   between the blue ridge and alleghaney and   westward of the alleghaney the state by another division is formed into parishes many of which are commensurate with the counties but sometimes a county comprehends more than one parish and sometimes a parish more than one county this division had relation to the religion of the state a parson of the anglican church with a fixed salary having been heretofore established in each parish the care of the poor was another object of the parochial division we have no townships our country being much intersected with navigable waters     and trade brought generally to our doors instead of our being   obliged to go in quest of it has probably been one of the causes why we have no towns of any consequence williamsburg which till the year    0 was the seat of our government never contained above   00 inhabitants and norfolk the most populous town we ever had contained but  000 our towns but more properly our villages or hamlets are as follows on james river and its waters norfolk portsmouth hampton suffolk smithfield williamsburg petersburg richmond the seat of our government manchester charlottesville new london on york river and its waters york newcastle hanover on rappahannoc urbanna portroyal fredericksburg falmouth on patowmac and its waters dumfries colchester alexandria winchester staunton on the ohio louisville there are other places at which like some of the foregoing the laws have said there shall be towns but nature has said there shall not and they remain unworthy of enumeration norfolk will probably be the empo    rium for all the trade of the chesapeak bay and its waters and a canal of   or  0 miles will bring to it all that of albemarle sound and its waters secondary to this place are the towns at the head of the tide waters to wit petersburg on appamattox richmond on james river newcastle on york river alexandria on patowmac and baltimore on the patapsco from these the distribution will be to subordinate situations in the country   accidental circumstances however may controul the indications of nature and in no instance do they do it more frequently than in the rise and fall of towns query xiii the constitution of the state and its several charters queen elizabeth by her letters patent bearing date march         licensed sir walter raleigh to search for remote heathen lands not inhabited by christian people and granted to him in fee simple all the soil within  00 leagues of the places where his people should within six years make their dwellings or abid    ings reserving only to herself and her successors their allegiance and one fifth part of all the gold and silver ore they should obtain sir walter immediately sent out two ships which visited wococon island in north carolina and the next year despatched seven with  0  men who settled in roanoke island about latitude   °  0′ here okisko king of the weopomeiocs in a full council of his people is said to have acknowledged himself the homager of the queen of england and after her of sir walter raleigh a supply of  0 men were sent in      and   0 in      with these last sir walter sent a governor appointed him twelve assistants gave them a charter of incorporation and instructed them to settle on chesapeak bay they landed however at hatorask in      when a fleet was ready to sail with a new supply of colonists and necessaries they were detained by the queen to assist against the spanish armada sir walter   having now expended  0000l in these enterprises obstructed occasionally by the crown without a shilling of aid from it was under a necessity of engaging others to adventure their money he therefore by deed bearing date the  th of     march      by the name of sir walter raleigh chief governor of assamàcomòc probably acomàc alias wingadacoia alias virginia granted to thomas smith and others in consideration of their adventuring certain sums of money liberty to trade to this new country free from all customs and taxes for seven years excepting the fifth part of the gold and silver ore to be obtained and stipulated with them and the other assistants then in virginia that he would confirm the deed of incorporation which he had given in      with all the prerogatives jurisdictions royalties and privileges granted to him by the queen sir walter at different times sent five other adventurers hither the last of which was in   0  for in   0  he was attainted and put into close imprisonment which put an end to his cares over his infant colony what was the particular fate of the colonists he had before sent and seated has never been known whether they were murdered or incorporated with the savages some gentlemen and merchants supposing that by the attainder of sir walter raleigh the grant to him was forfeited not enquiring over carefully whether the sentence of an     english court could affect lands not within the jurisdiction of that court petitioned king james for a new grant of virginia to them he accordingly executed a grant to sir   thomas gates and others bearing date the  th of march   0  under which in the same year a settlement was affected at jamestown and ever after maintained of this grant however no particular notice need be taken as it was superceded by letters patent of the same king of may      0  to the earl of salisbury and others incorporating them by the name of the treasurer and company of adventurers and planters of the city of london for the first colony in virginia granting to them and their successors all the lands in virginia from point comfort along the seacoast to the northward  00 miles and from the same point along the sea coast to the southward two hundred miles and all the space from this precinct on the sea coast up into the land west and north west from sea to sea and the islands within one hundred miles of it with all the commodities jurisdictions royalties privileges franchises and preeminences within the same and thereto and thereabouts by sea and land appertain    ing in as ample manner as had before been granted to any adventurer to be held of the king and his successors in common soccage yielding onefifth part of the gold and silver ore to be therein found for all manner of services establishing a council in england for the direction of the enterprise the members of which were to be chosen and displaced by the voice of the majority of the company and adventurers and were to have the nomination and revocation of the governors officers and ministers which by them should be thought needful for the colony the power of establishing laws and   forms of government and magistracy obligatory not only within the colony but also on the seas in going and coming to and from it authorizing them to carry thither any persons who should consent to go freeing them forever from all taxes and impositions on any goods or merchandise on importation into the colony or exportation out of it except the five per cent due for customs on all goods imported into the british dominions according to the ancient trade of merchants which five per cent only being paid they might within    months reexport the same goods     into foreign parts without any custom tax or other duty to the king or any his officers or deputies with powers of waging war against those who should annoy them giving to the inhabitants of the colony all the rights of natural subjects as if born and abiding in england and declaring that these letters should be construed in all doubtful parts in such manner as should be most for the benefit of the grantees afterwards on the   th of march      by other letters patent the king added to his former grants all islands in any part of the ocean between the  0th and   st degrees of latitude and within  00 leagues of any of the parts before granted to the treasurer and company not being possessed or inhabited by any other christian prince or state nor within the limits of the northern colony in pursuance of the authorities given to the company by these charters and more especially of that part in the charter of   0  which authorized them to establish a form of government they on the   th   of july      by charter under their common seal declared that from thence forward there should be two supreme councils in virginia the one     to be called the council of state to be placed and displaced by the treasurer council in england and company from time to time whose office was to be that of assisting and advising the governor the other to be called the general assembly to be convened by the governor once yearly or oftener which was to consist of the council of state and two burgesses out of every town hundred or plantation to be respectively chosen by the inhabitants in this all matters were to be decided by the greater part of the votes present reserving to the governor a negative voice and they were to have power to treat consult and conclude all emergent occasions concerning the public weal and to make laws for the behoof and government of the colony imitating and following the laws and policy of england as nearly as might be providing that these laws should have no force till ratified in a general quarter court of the company in england and returned under their common seal and declaring that after the government of the colony should be well framed and settled no orders of the council in england should bind the colony unless ratified in the said  00 general assembly the king and company quarrelled and by a mixture of law and force the latter were ousted of all their rights without retribution after having expended  00000£ in establishing the colony without the smallest aid from government king james suspended their powers by  0 proclamation of july         and charles i took the government into his own hands both sides had their partisans in the colony but in truth the people of the colony in general thought themselves little concerned in the dispute there being three parties interested in these several charters what passed between the first and second it was thought could not affect the third if the king seized on the powers of the company they only passed into other hands without increase or diminution while the rights of the people remained as they were but they did not remain so long the northern parts of their country were granted away to the lords baltimore and fairfax the first of these obtaining also the rights of separate jurisdiction and government and in    0 the parliament considering itself as standing in the place of their deposed king and as having succeeded  0  to all his powers without as well as within the realm began to assume a right over the colonies passing an act for inhibiting their trade with foreign nations this succession to the exercise of kingly authority gave the first color for parliamentary interference with the colonies and produced that fatal precedent which they continued to follow after they had retired in other respects within their proper functions when this colony therefore which still maintained its opposition to cromwell and the parliament was induced in      to lay down their arms they previously secured their most essential rights by a solemn convention which having never seen in print i will here insert literally from the records    articles agreed on  concluded at james cittie in virginia for the surrendering

that by this solemn convention entered into with arms in their hands they had secured the antient limits  of their country its free trade  its exemption from taxation  but by their own  0  assembly and exclusion of military force  from among them yet in every of these points was this convention violated by subsequent kings and parliaments and other infractions of their constitution equally dangerous committed their general assembly which was composed of the council of state and burgesses sitting together and deciding by plurality of voices was split into two houses by which the council obtained a separate negative on their laws appeals from their supreme court which had been fixed by law in their general assembly were arbitrarily revoked to england to be there heard before the king and council instead of four hundred miles on the seacoast they were reduced in the space of thirty years to about one    hundred miles their trade with foreigners was totally suppressed and when carried to great britain was there loaded with imposts it is unnecessary however to glean up the several instances of injury as scattered through american and british history and the more especially as by  0  passing on to the accession of the present king we shall find specimens of them all aggravated multiplied and crouded within a small compass of time so as to evince a fixed design of considering our rights natural conventional and chartered as mere nullities the following is an epitome of the first sixteen years of his reign the colonies were taxed internally and externally their essential interests sacrificed to individuals in great britain their legislatures suspended charters annulled trials by juries taken away their persons subjected to transportation across the atlantic and to trial before foreign judicatories their supplications for redress thought beneath answer themselves published as cowards in the councils of their mother country and courts of europe armed troops sent among them to enforce submission to these violences and actual hostilities commenced against them no alternative was presented but resistance or unconditional submission between these could be no hesitation they closed in the appeal to arms they declared themselves independent states they confederated together into one great republic thus securing to   0 every state the benefit of an union of their whole force in each state separately a new form of government was established of ours particularly    the following are the outlines the executive powers are lodged in the hands of a governor chosen annually and incapable of acting more than three years in seven he is assisted by a council of eight members the judiciary powers are divided among several courts as will be hereafter explained legislation is exercised by two houses of assembly the one called the house of delegates composed of two members from each county chosen annually by the citizens possessing an estate for life in  00 acres of uninhabited land or    acres with a house on it or in a house or lot in some town the other called the senate consisting of    members chosen quadrennially by the same electors who for this purpose are distributed into    districts the concurrence of both houses is necessary to the passage of a law they have the appointment of the governor and council the judges of the superior courts auditors attorney general treasurer register of the land office and delegates to congress as the dismemberment of the state had never had its con    firmation but on the contrary had always been the subject of protestation and complaint that it might never be in our own power to raise scruples on that subject or to disturb the harmony of our new confederacy the grants to maryland pennsylvania and the two carolinas were ratified this constitution was formed when we were new and unexperienced in the science of government it was the first too which was formed in the whole united states no wonder then that time and trial have discovered very capital defects in it      the majority of the men in the state who pay and fight for its support are unrepresented in the legislature the roll of freeholders entitled to vote not including generally the half of those on the roll of the militia or of the taxgatherers   among those who share the representation the shares are very unequal thus the county of warwick with only one hundred fighting men has an equal representation with the county of loudon which has      so that every man in warwick has as much influence in the government as    men in loudon but lest it should be thought that an equal interspersion of small among large coun    ties through the whole state may prevent any danger of injury to particular parts of it we will divide it into districts and shew the proportions of land of fighting men and of representation in each  square miles fighting men delegates senators between the sea  coast and falls of the rivers     0    0         between the falls of the rivers and blue ridge of mountains                  between the blue ridge and the alleghany                 between the alleghany and ohio      0           total                      of these     are on the eastern shore—t j  of these       are eastward of the meridian of the mouth of the great kanhaway—t j an inspection of this table will supply the place of commentaries on it it will appear at once that nineteen thousand men living below the falls of the rivers possess half of the senate and want four    members only of possessing a majority of the house of delegates a want more than supplied by the vicinity of their situation to the seat of government and of course the greater degree of convenience and punctuality with which     their members may and will attend in the legislature these nineteen thousand therefore living in one part of the country give law to upwards of thirty thousand living in another and appoint all their chief officers executive and judiciary from the difference of their situation and circumstances their interests will often be very different   the senate is by its constitution too homogenous with the house of delegates being chosen by the same electors at the same time and out of the same subjects the choice falls of course on men of the same description the purpose of establishing different houses of legislation is to introduce the influence of different interests or different principles thus in great britain it is said their constitution relies on the house of commons for honesty and the lords for wisdom which would be a rational reliance if honesty were to be bought with money and if wisdom were hereditary in some of the american states the delegates and senators are so chosen as that the first represent the persons and the second the property of the state but with us wealth and wisdom have equal chance for admission into both houses we do not     therefore derive from the separation of our legislature into two houses those benefits which a proper complication of principles is capable of producing and those  0 which alone can compensate the evils which may be produced by their dissensions   all the powers of government legislative executive and judiciary result to the legislative body the concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic government it will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands and not by a single one     despots would surely be as oppressive as one let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic of venice as little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves an elective despotism was not the government we fought for but one which should not only be founded on free principles but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limits without being effectually checked and restrained by the others for this reason that convention which passed the ordinance of government     laid its foundation on this basis that the legislative executive and judiciary departments should be separate and distinct so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time but no barrier was provided between these several powers the judiciary and executive members were left dependent on the legislative for their subsistence in office and some of them for their continuance in it if therefore the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers no opposition is likely to be made nor if made can it be effectual because in that case they may    put their proceedings into the form of an act of assembly which will render them obligatory on the other branches they have accordingly in many instances decided rights which should have been left to judiciary controversy and the direction of the executive during the whole time of their session is becoming habitual and familiar and this is done with no ill intention the views of the present members are perfectly upright when they are led out of their regular province it is by art in others and inadvertence in themselves and this will probably be the case for some     time to come but it will not be a very long time mankind soon learn to make interested uses of every right and power which they possess or may assume the public money and public liberty intended to have been deposited with three branches of magistracy but found inadvertently to be in the hands of one only will soon be discovered to be sources of wealth and dominion to those who hold them distinguished too by this tempting circumstance that they are the instrument as well as the object of acquisition with money we will get men said cæsar and with men we will get money nor should our assembly be deluded by the integrity of their own purposes and conclude that these unlimited powers will never be abused because themselves are not disposed to abuse them they should look forward to a time and that not a distant one when a corruption in this as in the country from which we derive our origin will have seized the heads of government and be spread by them through the body of the    people when they will purchase the voices of the people and make them pay the price human nature is the same on every side of the atlan    tic and will be alike influenced by the same causes the time to guard against corruption and tyranny is before they shall have gotten hold of us it is better to keep the wolf out of the fold than to trust to drawing his teeth and talons after he shall have entered to render these considerations the more cogent we must observe in addition   that the ordinary legislature may alter the constitution itself on the discontinuance of assemblies it became necessary to substitute in their place some other body competent to the ordinary business of government and to the calling forth the powers of the state for the maintenance of our opposition to great britain conventions were therefore introduced consisting of two delegates from each county meeting together and forming one house on the plan of the former house of burgesses to whose places they succeeded these were at first chosen anew for every particular session but in march      they recommended to the people to choose a convention which should continue in office a year this was done accordingly in april      and in the july following that convention passed an ordinance for the election of delegates in the month of april annually it is well known that in july      a separation from great britain and establishment of republican government had never yet entered into any persons mind a convention therefore chosen under that ordinance    cannot be said to have been chosen for the purposes which certainly did not exist in the minds of those who passed it under this ordinance at the annual election in april      a convention for the year was chosen independance and the establishment of a new form of government were not even yet the objects of the people at large one extract from the pamphlet called common sense had appeared in the virginia papers in february and copies of the pamphlet itself had got in a few hands  but the idea had not been opened to the mass of the people in april much less can it be said that they had made up their minds in its favor  so that the electors of april      no more than the legislators of july      not thinking of independance and a permanent republic could not mean to vest in these delegates powers of establishing them or any authorities other than those of the ordinary     legislature so far as a temporary organization of government was necessary to render our opposition energetic so far their organization was valid but they received in their creation no powers but what were given to every legislature before and since they could    not therefore pass an act transcendent to the powers of other legislatures if the present assembly pass an act and declare it shall be irrevocable by subsequent assemblies the declaration is merely void and the act repealable as other acts are so far and no farther authorized they organized the government by the ordinance entituled a constitution or form of government it pretends to no higher authority than the other ordinance of the same session it does not say that it shall be perpetual that it shall be unalterable by other legislatures that it shall be transcendent above the powers of those who they knew would have equal power with themselves not only the silence of the instrument is a proof they thought it would be alterable but their own practice also for this very convention meeting as a house of delegates in general assembly with the senate in the autumn of that year   0 passed acts of assembly in contradiction of their ordinance of government and every assembly from that time to this has done the same i am safe therefore in the position that the constitution itself is alterable by the ordinary legislature though this opinion seems founded on the first elements of common sense yet is the contrary maintained by some persons i because say they the conventions were vested with every power necessary to make effectual opposition to great britain but to complete this argument they must go on and say further that effectual opposition could not be made to great britain without establishing a form of government perpetual and unalterable by the legislature    which is not true an opposition which at some time or other was to come to an end could not need a perpetual institution to carry it on and a government amendable as its defects should be discovered was likely to make effectual resistance as one that should be unalterably wrong besides the assemblies were as much vested with all powers requisite for resistance as the conventions were if therefore these powers included that of modelling the form     of government in the one case they did so in the other the assemblies then as well as the conventions may model the government that is they may alter the ordinance of government   they urge that if the convention had meant that this instrument should be alterable as their other ordinances were they would have called it an ordinance but they have called it a constitution which ex vi termini means an act above the power of the ordinary legislature i answer that constitutio constitutum statutum lex are convertible terms constitutio dicitur jus quod a principe conditur constitutum quod ab imperatoribus rescriptum statutumve est statutum idem quod lex calvini lexicon juridicum constitution and statute were originally terms of the  civil law and from thence introduced by ecclesiastics into the english law thus in the statute    hen viii c    §   constitutions and ordinances are used as synonimous the term constitution has many     other significations in physics and politics but in    jurisprudence whenever it is applied to any act of the legislature it invariably means a statue law or ordinance which is the present case no inference then of a different meaning can be drawn from the adoption of this title on the contrary we might conclude that by their affixing to it a term synonimous with ordinance or statute they meant it to be an ordinance or statute but of what consequence is their meaning where their power is denied if they meant to do more than they had power to do did this give them power it is not the name but the authority which renders an act obligatory lord coke says an article of the statute    r ii c   that no person should attempt to revoke any ordinance then made is repealed for that such restraint is against the jurisdiction and power of the parliament   inst    and again though divers parliaments have attempted to restrain subsequent parliaments yet could they never effect it for the latter parliament hath ever power to abrogate suspend qualify explain or make void the former in the whole or in     any part thereof notwithstanding any words of restraint prohibition or penalty in the former for it is a maxim in the laws of the parliament quod leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant   inst   —to get rid of the magic supposed to be in the word constitution let us translate it into its definition as given by those who think it above the power of the law and let us suppose the convention instead of saying we the ordinary legislature establish a constitution had said we the ordinary legislature establish    an act above the power of the ordinary legislature does not this expose the absurdity of the attempt   but say they the people have acquiesced and this has given it an authority superior to the laws it is true that the people did not rebel against it and was that a time for the people to rise in rebellion should a prudent acquiescence at a critical time be construed into a confirmation of every illegal thing done during that period besides why should they rebel at an annual election they had chosen delegates for the year to exercise the ordinary powers of legislation and to manage the great contest in which they were engaged these     delegates thought the contest would be best managed by an organized government they therefore among others passed an ordinance of government they did not presume to call it perpetual and unalterable they well knew they had no power to make it so that our choice of them had been for no such purpose and at a time when we could have no such purpose in contemplation had an unalterable form of government been meditated perhaps we should have chosen a different set of people there was no cause then for the people to rise in rebellion but to what dangerous lengths will this argument lead did the acquiescence of the colonies under the various acts of power exercised by great britain in our infant state confirm these acts and so far invest them with the authority of the people as to render them unalterable and our present resistance wrong on every unauthoritative exercise of power by the legislature must the people rise in rebellion or their    silence be construed into a surrender of that power to them if so how many rebellions should we have had already one certainly for every session of assembly the other states in the union have been of opi   nion that to render a form of government unalterable by ordinary acts of assembly the people must delegate persons with special powers they have accordingly chosen special conventions to form and fix their governments the individuals then who maintain the contrary opinion in this country should have the modesty to suppose it possible that they may be wrong and the rest of america right but if there be only a possibility of their being wrong if only a plausible doubt remains of the validity of the ordinance of government is it not better to remove that doubt by placing it on a bottom which none will dispute if they be right we shall only have the unnecessary trouble of meeting once in convention if they be wrong they expose us to the hazard of having no fundamental rights at all true it is this is no time for deliberating on forms of government while an enemy is within our bowels the first object is to expel him but when this shall be done when peace shall be established and leisure given us for intrenching within good forms the rights for which we have bled let no man be found indolent enough to de   cline a little more trouble for placing them beyond the reach of question if anything more be requisite to produce a conviction of the expediency of calling a convention at a proper season to fix our form of government let it be the reflection      that the assembly exercises a power of determining the quorum of their own body which may legislate for us after the establishment of the new form they adhered to the lex majoris partis founded in  common law as well as common right it is the  natural law of every assembly of men whose numbers are not fixed by any other law they continued for some time to require the presence of a majority of their whole number to pass an act but the british parliament fixes its own quorum our former assemblies fixed their own quorum and one precedent in favor of power is stronger than an hundred against it the house of delegates therefore have  lately voted that dur   ing the present dangerous invasion forty members shall be a house to proceed to business they have been moved to this by the fear of not being able to collect a house but this danger could not authorize them to call that a house which was none  and if they may fix it at one number they may at another till it loses its fundamental character of being a representative body as this vote expires with the  0 present invasion it is probable the former rule will be permitted to revive because at present no ill is meant the power however of fixing their own quorum has been avowed and a precedent set from forty it may be reduced to four and from four to one from a house to a committee from a committee to a chairman or speaker and thus an oligarchy or monarchy be substituted under forms supposed to be regular omnia mala exempla ex bonis orta sunt sed ubi imperium ad ignaros aut minus bonos pervenit novum illud exemplum ab dignis et idoneis ad indignos et non idoneos fertur when therefore it is considered that there is no legal obstacle to the assumption by the assembly of all the powers legislative executive and judiciary     and that these may come to the hands of the smallest rag of delegation surely the people will say and their representatives while yet they have honest representatives will advise them to say that they will not acknowledge as laws any acts not considered and assented to by the major part of their delegates in enumerating the defects of the constitution it would be wrong to count among them what is only the error of particular persons in december      our circumstances being much distressed it was proposed in the house of delegates to create a dictator invested with every power legislative executive and judiciary civil and military of life and of death over our persons and over our properties and in june       again under calamity    the same proposition was repeated and wanted a few votes only of being passed —one who entered    into this contest from a pure love of liberty and a sense of injured rights who determined to make every sacrifice and to meet every danger for the reestablishment of those rights on a firm basis who did not mean to expend his blood and substance for the wretched pur     pose of changing this master for that but to place the powers of governing him in a plurality of hands of his own choice so that the corrupt will of no one man might in future oppress him must stand confounded and dismayed when he is told that a considerable portion of that plurality had meditated the surrender of them into a single hand and in lieu of a limited monarch to deliver him over to a despotic one how must he  find his efforts and sacrifices abused and baffled if he may still by a single vote be laid prostrate at the feet of one man in gods name from whence have they derived this power is it from our ancient laws none such can be produced is it from any principle in our new constitution expressed or implied every lineament    of that expressed or implied is in full opposition to it its fundamental principle is that the state shall be governed as a commonwealth it provides a republican organization proscribes under the name of prerogative the exercise of all powers undefined by the laws places on this basis the whole system of our laws and by consolidating them together chooses that they shall be left to stand or fall together never   0 providing for any circumstances nor admitting that such could arise wherein either should be suspended no not for a moment our antient laws expressly declare that those who are but delegates themselves shall not delegate to others powers which require judgment and integrity in their exercise or was this proposition moved on a supposed right in the movers of abandoning their posts in a moment of distress the same laws forbid the abandonment of that post even on ordinary occasions and much more a transfer of their powers into other hands and other forms without consulting the people they never admit the idea that these like sheep or cattle may be given from hand to hand without an appeal to their own will—was it from the necessity of the case necessities which dissolve a government do not convey its authority to an oligarchy or a monarchy they throw back into the hands of the people the powers they had delegated and leave them as individuals to shift for themselves a leader may offer but not impose himself nor be imposed on them much less can their necks be submitted to his sword their breath be held at his    will or caprice     the necessity which should operate these tremendous effects should at least be palpable and irresistible yet in both instances where it was feared or pretended with us it was belied by the event it was belied too by the preceding experience of our sister states several of whom had grappled through greater difficulties without abandoning their forms of government when the proposition was first made massachusets had found even the government of committees sufficient to carry them through an invasion but we at the time of that proposition were under no invasion when the second was made there had been added to this example those of rhodeisland newyork newjersey and pennsylvania in all of which the republican form had been found equal to the task of carrying them through the severest trials in this state alone did there exist so little virtue that fear was to be fixed in the hearts of the people and to become the motive of their exertions and the principle of their government the very thought alone was treason against the people was treason against mankind in general as rivetting forever the chains which bow down their necks by gi    ving to their oppressors a proof which they would have trumpeted through the universe of the imbecility of republican government in times of pressing danger to shield them from harm those who assume the right of giving away the reins of government in any case must be sure that the herd whom they hand on to the rods and hatchet of the dictator will lay their necks on the    block when he shall nod to them but if our assemblies supposed such a resignation in the people i hope they mistook their character i am of opinion that the government instead of being braced and invigorated for greater exertions under their difficulties would have been thrown back upon the bungling machinery of county committees for administration till a convention could have been called and its wheels again set into regular motion what a cruel moment was this for creating such an embarrassment for putting to the proof the attachment of our countrymen to republican government those who meant well of the advocates for this measure and most of them meant well for i know them personally had been their fellowlabourers in the common cause and had     often proved the purity of their principles had been seduced in their judgment by the example of an antient republic whose constitution and circumstances were fundamentally different they had sought this precedent in the history of rome where alone it was to be found and where at length too it had proved fatal they had taken it from a republic rent by the most bitter factions and tumults where the government was of a heavyhanded unfeeling aristocracy over a people ferocious and rendered desperate by poverty and wretchedness tumults which could not be allayed under the most trying circumstances but by the omnipotent hand of a single despot their constitution therefore allowed a temporary tyrant to be erected under the name of a dictator and that temporary tyrant    after a few examples became perpetual they misapplied this precedent to a people mild in their dispositions patient under their trial united for the public liberty and affectionate to their leaders but if from the constitution of the roman government there resulted to their senate a power of submitting all their rights to the will of one man does it follow that     the assembly of virginia have the same authority what clause in our constitution has substituted that of rome by way of residuary provision for all cases not otherwise provided for or if they may step ad libitum into any other form of government for precedents to rule us by for what oppression may not a precedent be found in this world of the bellum omnium in omnia searching for the foundations of this proposition i can find none which may pretend a colour of right or reason but the defect before developed that there being no barrier between the legislative executive and judiciary departments the legislature may seize the whole that having seized it and possessing a right to fix their own quorum they may reduce that quorum to one whom they may call a chairman speaker dictator or by any other name they please—our situation is indeed perilous and i hope my countrymen will be sensible of it and will apply at a proper season the proper remedy which is a convention to fix the constitution to amend its defects to bind up the several branches of government by certain laws which when they transgress their acts shall     become nullities to render unnecessary an appeal to the people or in other    words a rebellion on every infraction of their rights on the peril that their acquiescence shall be construed into an intention to surrender those rights query xiv the administration of justice and the description of the laws the state is divided into counties in every county are appointed magistrates called justices of the peace usually from eight to thirty or forty in number in proportion to the size of the county of the most discreet and honest inhabitants they are nominated by their fellows but commissioned by the governor and act without reward these magistrates have jurisdiction both criminal and civil if the question before them be a question of law only they decide on it themselves but if it be a fact or of fact and law combined it must be referred to a jury in the latter case of a combination of law and fact it is usual for the jurors to decide     the fact and to refer the law arising on it to the decision of the judges but this division of the subject lies with their discretion only and if the question relate to any point of public liberty or if it be one of those in which the judges may be suspected of bias the jury undertake to decide both law and fact if they be mistaken a decision against right which is casual only is less dangerous to the state and less afflicting to the loser than one which makes part of a regular and uniform system in truth it is better to toss up cross and pile in a    cause than to refer it to a judge whose mind is warped by any motive whatever in that particular case but the common sense of twelve honest men gives still a better chance of just decision than the hazard of cross and pile these judges execute their process by the sheriff or coroner of the county or by constables of their own appointment if any free person commit an offence against the commonwealth if it be below the degree of felony he is bound by a justice to appear before their court to answer it on indictment or information if it amount to felony he is committed to jail a court of these justices     is called if they on examination think him guilty they send him to the jail of the general court before which court he is to be tried first by a grand jury of    of whom    must concur in opinion if they find him guilty he is then tried by a jury of    men of the county where the offence was committed and by their verdict which must be unanimous he is acquitted or condemned without appeal if the criminal be a slave the trial by the county court is final in every case however except that of high treason there resides in the governor a power of pardon in high treason the pardon can only flow from the general assembly in civil matters these justices have jurisdiction in all cases of whatever value not appertaining to the department of the admiralty this jurisdiction is twofold if the matter in dispute be of less value than  ⅙ dollars a single member may try it at any time and place within his county and may award execution on the goods of the party cast if it be of that or    greater value it is determinable before the county court which consists of four at the least of those justices and assembles at the courthouse of the county on a certain day     in every month from their determination if the matter be of the value of ten pounds sterling or concern the title or bounds of lands an appeal lies to one of the superior courts there are three superior courts to wit the high court of chancery the general court and court of admiralty the first and second of these receive appeals from the county courts and also have original jurisdiction where the subject of controversy is of the value of ten pounds sterling or where it concerns the title or bounds of lands the jurisdiction of the admiralty is original altogether the high court of chancery is composed of three judges the general court of five and the court of admiralty of three the two first hold their sessions at richmond at stated times the chancery twice in the year and the general court twice for business civil and criminal and twice more for criminal only the court of admiralty sits at williamsburg whenever a controversy arises there is one supreme court called the court of appeals composed of the judges of the three superior courts assembling twice a year at stated times at richmond this court     receives appeals in all civil cases from each of the superior courts and determines them finally but it has no original jurisdiction if a controversy arise between two foreigners of a nation in alliance with the united states it is  0 decided by the consul for their state or if both parties chuse it by the ordinary courts of justice if one of the parties only be such a foreigner it is triable before the courts of justice of the country but if it shall have been instituted in a county court the foreigner may remove it into the general court or court of chancery who are to determine it at their first sessions as they must also do if it be originally commenced before them in cases of life and death such foreigners have a right to be tried by a jury the onehalf foreigners the other natives all public accounts are settled with a board of auditors consisting of three members appointed by the general assembly any two of whom may act but an individual dissatisfied with the determination of that board may carry his case into the proper superior court   0 a description of the laws the general assembly was constituted as has been already shown by letterspatent of march the  th   0  in the  th year of the reign of james the first the laws of england seem to have been adopted by consent of the settlers which might easily enough be done whilst they were few and living all together of such adoption however we have no other proof than their practice till the year      when they were expressly adopted by an act of the assembly except so far as a difference of condition rendered them inapplicable under this adoption the rule in our courts of judicature was that the common law of england and the general statutes previous to    the  th of james were in force here but that no subsequent statutes were unless we were named in them said the judges and other partisans of the crown but named or not named said those who reflected freely it will be unnecessary to attempt a description of the laws of england as that may be found in english publications to those which were established here by the adoption of the legislature have been since added a number of     acts of assembly passed during the monarchy and ordinances of convention and acts of assembly enacted since the establishment of the republic the following variations from the british model are perhaps worthy of being specified debtors unable to pay their debts and making faithful delivery of their whole effects are released from confinement and their persons forever discharged from restraint for such previous debts but any property they may afterwards acquire will be subject to their creditors the poor unable to support themselves are maintained by an assessment on the titheable persons in their parish this assessment is levied and administered by twelve persons in each parish called vestrymen originally chosen by the housekeepers of the parish but afterwards filling vacancies in their own body by their own choice these are usually the most discreet farmers so distributed through their parish that every part of it may be under the immediate eye of some one of them they are well acquainted with the details and œconomy of private life and they find sufficient    inducements to execute     their charge well in their philanthropy in the approbation of their neighbors and the distinction which that gives them the poor who have neither property friends nor strength to labour are boarded in the houses of good farmers to whom a stipulated sum is annually paid to those who are able to help themselves a little or have friends from whom they derive some succours inadequate however to their full maintenance supplementary aids are given which enable them to live comfortably in their own houses or in the houses of their friends vagabonds without visible property or vocation are placed in work houses where they are well clothed fed lodged and made to labour nearly the same methods of providing for the poor prevails through all our states and from savannah to portsmouth you will seldom meet a beggar in the larger towns indeed they sometimes present themselves these are usually foreigners who have never obtained a settlement in any parish i never yet saw a native american begging in the streets or highways a subsistence is easily gained here and if by misfortunes they are thrown on the charities of the world those provided by their own country are so comfortable and so certain     that they never think of relinquishing them to become strolling beggars their situation too when sick in the family of a good farmer where every member is emulous to do them kind offices where they are visited by all the neighbors who bring them the little rarities which their sickly appetites may crave and who take by rotation the    nightly watch over them when their condition requires it is without comparison better than in a general hospital where the sick the dying and the dead are crammed together in the same rooms and often in the same beds the disadvantages inseparable from general hospitals are such as can never be counterpoised by all the regularities of medicine and regimen nature and kind nursing save a much greater proportion in our plain way at a smaller expense and with less abuse one branch only of hospital institution is wanting with us that is a general establishment for those laboring under difficult cases of chirurgery the aids of this art are not equivocal but an able chirurgeon cannot be had in every parish such a receptacle should therefore be provided for those patients but no others should be admitted     marriages must be solemnized either on special licence granted by the first magistrate of the county on proof of the consent of the parent or guardian of either party under age or after solemn publication on three several sundays at some place of religious worship in the parishes where the parties reside the act of solemnization may be by the minister of any society of christians who shall have been previously licensed for this purpose by the court of the county quakers and menonists however are exempted from all these conditions and marriage among them is to be solemnized by the society itself a foreigner of any nation not in open war with us becomes naturalized by removing to the state    to reside and taking an oath of fidelity and thereupon acquires every right of a native citizen and citizens may divest themselves of that character by declaring by solemn deed or in open court that they mean to expatriate themselves and no longer to be citizens of this state conveyances of land must be registered in the court of the county wherein they lie or in the general court or they are void     as to creditors and subsequent purchasers slaves pass by descent and dower as lands do where the descent is from a parent the heir is bound to pay an equal share of their value in money to each of his brothers and sisters slaves as well as lands were entailable during the monarchy but by an act of the first republican assembly all donees in tail present and future were vested with the absolute dominion of the entailed subject bills of exchange being protested carry  0 per cent interest from their date no person is allowed in any other case to take more than five per centum per annum simple interest for the loan of moneys gaming debts are made void and monies actually paid to discharge such debts if they exceed  0 shillings may be recovered by the payer within three months or by any other person afterwards tobacco flour beef pork tar pitch and turpentine must be inspected by persons publicely appointed before they can be exported     the erecting ironworks and mills is encouraged    by many privileges with necessary cautions however to prevent their dams from obstructing the navigation of the water courses the general assembly have on several occasions shewn a great desire to encourage the opening the great falls of james and patowmac rivers as yet however neither of these have been effected the laws have also descended to the preservation and improvement of the races of useful animals such as horses cattle deer to the extirpation of those which are noxious as wolves squirrels crows blackbirds and to the guarding our citizens against infectious disorders by obliging suspected vessels coming into the state to perform quarantine and by regulating the conduct of persons having such disorders within the state the mode of acquiring lands in the earliest times of our settlement was by petition to the general assembly if the lands prayed for were already cleared of the indian title and the assembly thought the prayer reasonable they passed the property by their vote to the petitioner but if they had not yet been ceded by the indians it was neces    sary that the petitioner should previously purchase their right this purchase the assembly verified by enquries of the indian proprietors and being satisfied of its reality and fairness proceeded further to examine the reasonableness of the petition and its consistence with policy and according to the result either granted or rejected the petition the company also sometimes though very rarely granted lands independently of the general assembly as    the colony increased and individual applications for land multiplied it was found to give too much occupation to the general assembly to inquire into and execute the grant in every special case they therefore thought it better to establish general rules according to which all grants should be made and to leave to the governor the execution of them under these rules this they did by what have been usually called the land laws amending them from time to time as their defects were developed according to these laws when an individual wished a portion of unappropriated land he was to locate and survey it by a public officer appointed for that purpose its breadth was to bear a certain pro     portion to its length the grant was to be executed by the governor and the lands were to be improved in a certain manner within a given time from these regulations there resulted to the state a sole and exclusive power of taking conveyances of the indian right of soil since according to them an indian conveyance alone could give no right to an individual which the laws would acknowledge the state or the crown thereafter made general purchases of the indians from time to time and the governor parcelled them out by special grants conformed to the rules before described which it was not in his power or in that of the crown to dispense with grants unaccompanied by their proper legal circumstances were set aside regularly by scire facias or by bill in chancery since the establishment of our new government this order of things is but little changed an individual    wishing to appropriate to himself lands still unappropriated by any other pays to the public treasurer a sum of money proportioned to the quantity he wants he carries the treasurers receipt to the auditors of public accompts who thereupon debit the treasurer     with the sum and order the register of the landoffice to give the party a warrant for his land with this warrant from the register he goes to the surveyor of the county where the land lies on which he has cast his eye the surveyor lays it off for him gives him its exact description in the form of a certificate which certificate he returns to the landoffice where a grant is made out and is signed by the governor this vests in him a perfect dominion in his lands transmissible to whom he pleases by deed or will or by descent to his heirs if he die intestate many of the laws which were in force during the monarchy being relative merely to that form of government or inculcating principles inconsistent with republicanism the first assembly which met after the establishment of the commonwealth appointed a committee to revise the whole code to reduce it into proper form and volume and report it to the assembly this work has been executed by three gentlemen and reported but probably will not be taken up till a restoration of peace shall leave   0 to the legislature leisure to go through such a work  the plan of the revisal was this the common law of england by which is meant that part of the    english law which was anterior to the date of the oldest statutes extant is made the basis of the work it was thought dangerous to attempt to reduce it to a text it was therefore left to be collected from the usual monuments of it necessary alterations in that and so much of the whole body of the british statutes and of acts of assembly as were thought proper to be retained were digested into     new acts in which simplicity of style was aimed at as far as was safe the following are the most remarkable alterations proposed to change the rules of descent so as that the lands of any person dying intestate shall be divisible equally among all his children or other representatives in equal degree to make slaves distributable among the next of kin as other movables to have all public expences whether of the general treasury or of a parish or county as for the maintenance of the poor building bridges courthouses c supplied by as    sessments on the citizens in proportion to their property to hire undertakers for keeping the public roads in repair and indemnify individuals through whose lands new roads shall be opened to define with precision the rules whereby aliens should become citizens and citizens make themselves aliens to establish religious freedom on the broadest bottom to emancipate all slaves born after passing the act the bill reported by the revisers does not itself    contain this proposition but an amendment containing it was prepared to be offered to the legislature whenever the bill should be taken up and further directing that they should continue with their parents to a certain age then be brought up at the public expence to tillage arts or sciences according to their geniusses till the females should be eighteen and the males twentyone years of age when they should be colonized to such place as the circumstances of the time should render most proper sending them out with arms implements of household and of the handicraft arts seeds pairs of the     useful domestic animals c to declare them a free and independant people and extend to them our alliance and protection till they shall have acquired strength and to send vessels at the same time to other parts of the world for an equal number of white inhabitants to induce whom to migrate hither proper encouragements were to be proposed it will probably be asked why not retain and incorporate the blacks into the state and thus save the expence of supplying by importation of white settlers the vacancies they will leave deep rooted prejudices entertained by the whites ten thousand recollections by the blacks of the injuries they have sustained new provocations the real distinctions which nature has made and many other circumstances will divide us into parties and produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination of the one or the other race—to these objections which are political may be added others which are physical and moral the  0 first difference which strikes us is that of colour whether the black of the negro resides in the reticular membrane between the skin and scarfskin or in the scarfskin itself     whether it proceeds from the colour of the blood the colour of the bile or from that of some other secretion the difference is fixed in nature and is as real as if its seat and cause were better known to us and is this difference of no importance is it not the foundation of a greater or less share of beauty in the two races are not the fine mixtures of red and white the expressions of every passion by greater or less suffusions of colour in the one preferable to that eternal monotony which reigns in the countenances that immovable veil of black which covers all the emotions of the other race add to these flowing hair a more elegant symmetry of form their own judgment in favour of the whites declared by their preference of them as uniformly as is the preference of the oran ootan for the black woman over those of his own species the circumstance of superior beauty is thought worthy attention in the propagation of our horses dogs and other domestic animals why not in that of man besides those of colour figure and hair there are other physical distinctions proving a difference of race they have less hair on the face and body they secrete     less by the kidnies and more by the glands of the skin which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odour this greater degree of transpiration renders them more tolerant of heat and less so of cold than the whites perhaps too a difference of structure in    the pulmonary apparatus which a late ingenious  experimentalist has discovered to be the principal regulator of animal heat may have disabled them from extricating in the act of inspiration so much of that fluid from the outer air or obliged them in expiration to part with more of it they seem to require less sleep a black after hard labour through the day will be induced by the slightest amusements to sit up till midnight or later though knowing he must be out with the first dawn of the morning they are at least as brave and more adventuresome but this may perhaps proceed from a want of forethought which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present when present they do not go through it with more coolness or stea    diness than the whites they are more ardent after their female but love seems with them to be more an eager desire than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation their griefs are transient those numberless afflictions which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath are less felt and sooner forgotten with them in general their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection to this must be ascribed their disposition to sleep when abstracted from their diversions and unemployed in labour an animal whose body is at rest and who does not reflect must be disposed to sleep of course comparing them by their faculties of memory reason and imagination it appears to me that in memory they are equal to the whites in    reason much inferior as i think one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of euclid and that in imagination they are dull tasteless and anomalous it would be unfair to follow them to africa for this investigation we will consider them here on the same stage with the whites and where the facts are not apochryphal on which a judgment is to be     formed it will be right to make great allowances for the difference of condition of education of conversation of the sphere in which they move many millions of them have been brought to and born in america most of them indeed have been confined to tillage to their own homes and their own society yet many have been so situated that they might have availed themselves of the conversation of their masters many have been brought up to the handicraft arts and from that circumstance have always been associated with the whites some have been liberally educated and all have lived in countries where the arts and sciences are cultivated to a considerable degree and have had before their eyes samples of the best works from abroad the indians with no advantages of this kind will often carve figures on their pipes not destitute of design and merit they will crayon out an animal a plant or a country so as to prove the existence of a germ in their minds which only wants cultivation they astonish you with strokes of the most sublime oratory such as prove their reason and sentiment strong their     imagination glowing and elevated but never yet could i find that a black had uttered a thought    above the level of plain narration never seen even an elementary trait of painting or sculpture in music they are more generally gifted than the whites with accurate ears for tune and time and they have been found capable of imagining a small catch  whether they will be equal to the composition of a more extensive run of melody or of complicated harmony is yet to be proved misery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry—among the blacks is misery enough god knows but no poetry love is the peculiar œstrum of the poet their love is ardent but it kindles the senses only not the imagination religion indeed has produced a phyllis whately  but it could not produce a poet the compositions published under her name are below the dignity of criticism the heroes of the dunciad are to her as hercules to the author of that poem igna    tius sancoh  has approached nearer to merit in composition yet his letters do more honour to the heart than the head they breathe the purest effusions of friendship and general philanthropy and show how great a degree of the latter may be compounded with strong religious    zeal he is often happy in the turn of his compliments and his style is easy and familiar except when he affects a shandean fabrication of words but his imagination is wild and extravagant escapes incessantly from every restraint of reason and taste and in the course of its vagaries leaves a tract of thought as incoherent and eccentric as is the course of a meteor through the sky his subjects should often have led him to a process of sober reasoning yet we find him always substituting sentiment for demonstration upon the whole though we admit him to the first place among those of his own color who have presented themselves to the public judgment yet when we compare him with the writers of the race among whom he lived and particularly with the epistolary class in which he has taken his own stand we are compelled to enrol him at the bottom of the column     this criticism supposes the letters published under his name to be genuine and to have received amendment from no other hand points which would not be of easy investigation the improvement of the blacks in body and mind in the first instance of their mixture with the whites has been observed by every one and proves that their inferiority is not the effect merely of their condition of life we know that among the romans about the augustan age especially the condition of their slaves was much more deplorable than that of the blacks on the continent of america the two sexes were confined in separate apartments because to raise a child cost the master more than to buy one cato    for a very restricted indulgence to his slaves in this particular  took from them a certain price but in this country the slaves multiply as fast as the free inhabitants their situation and manners place the commerce between the two sexes almost without restraint—  0 the same cato on a principle of economy always sold his sick and superannuated slaves he gives it as a standing precept to a master visiting his farm to sell his old oxen old waggons old tools old and diseased servants and everything else become useless vendat boves vetulos plaustrum vetus feramenta vetera servum senem servum morbosum si quid aliud supersit vendat cato de re rusticâ c   the american slaves cannot enumerate this among the injuries and insults they receive it was the common practice to expose in the island æsculapius in the tyber diseased slaves whose cure was like to become tedious  the emperor claudius by an edict gave freedom to such of them as should recover and first declared that if any person chose to kill rather than to expose them it should be deemed homicide the exposing them is a crime of which no instance has existed with us and were it to be followed by death it would be punished capitally we are told of a certain vedius pollio who in the presence of augustus would have given a slave as food to his fish for having broken a glass  with the romans the regular    method of tak    ing the evidence of their slaves was under torture here it has been thought better never to resort to their evidence when a master was murdered all his slaves in the same house or within hearing were condemned to death here punishment falls on the guilty only and as precise proof is required against him as against a freeman yet notwithstanding these and other discouraging circumstances among the romans their slaves were often their rarest artists they excelled too in science insomuch as to be usually employed as tutors to their masters children epictetus  terence and phædrus were slaves but they were of the race of whites it is not their condition then but nature which has produced the distinction—whether further observation will or will not verify the conjecture that nature has been less bountiful to them in the endowments of the head i believe that in those of the heart she will be found to have done them justice that disposition to theft with which they have been branded must be ascribed to their situation and not to any depravity of the moral sense the man in whose favour no laws of property exist probably feels himself less     bound to respect those made in favour of others when arguing for ourselves we lay it down as a fundamental that laws to be just must give a reciprocation of right that without this they are mere arbitrary rules of conduct founded in force and not in conscience and it is a problem which i give to the    master to solve whether the religious precepts against the violation of property were not framed for him as well as his slave and whether the slave may not as justifiably take a little from one who has taken all from him as he may slay one who would slay him that a change in the relations in which a man is placed should change his ideas of moral right and wrong is neither new nor peculiar to the colour of the blacks homer tells us it was so   00 years ago   ἠμισυ γὰρ τ ἀρετής ἀποαίνυται εὐρύοπα ζεὺ   ἀφνερος ευτ ἂν μιν ϰατὰ δουλιον ἠμαρ ἓλησιν   —od            jove fixd it certain that whatever day   makes man a slave takes half his worth away but the slaves of which homer speaks were whites notwithstanding these considerations which must weaken their respect for the laws of property we find among them numerous     instances of the most rigid integrity and as many as among their better instructed masters of benevolence gratitude and unshaken fidelity the opinion that they are inferior in the faculties of reason and imagination must be hazarded with great diffidence to justify a general conclusion requires many observations even where the subject may be submitted to the anatomical knife to optical glasses to analysis by fire or by solvents how much more then where it is a faculty not a substance we are examining where it eludes the research of all the senses where the conditions of its existence are various and variously    combined where the effects of those which are present or absent bid defiance to calculation let me add too as a circumstance of great tenderness where our conclusion would degrade a whole race of men from the rank in the scale of beings which their creator may perhaps have given them to our reproach it must be said that though for a century and a half we have had under our eyes the races of black and of red men they have never yet been viewed by us as subjects of natural history i advance it     therefore as a suspicion only that the blacks whether originally a distinct race or made distinct by time and circumstances are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind it is not against experience to suppose that different species of the same genus or varieties of the same species may possess different qualifications will not a lover of natural history then one who views the gradations in all the races of animals with the eye of philosophy excuse an effort to keep those in the department of man as distinct as nature has formed them this unfortunate difference of colour and perhaps of faculty is a powerful obstacle to the emancipation of these people many of their advocates while they wish to vindicate the liberty of human nature are anxious also to preserve its dignity and beauty some of these embarrassed by the question what further is to be done with them join themselves in opposition with those who are actuated by sordid avarice only among the romans emancipation required but one effort the slave when made free might mix with without    staining the blood of his     master but with us a second is necessary unknown to history when freed he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture the revised code further proposes to proportion crimes and punishments this is attempted in the following scale       i crimes whose punishment extends to life     high treason death by hangingforfeiture of lands and goods to the commonwealth      petty treason death by hanging dissectionforfeiture of half the lands and goods to the representatives of the party slain      murder     by poison death by poisonforfeiture of onehalf as before      in duel death by hanging gibbeting if the challengerforfeiture of onehalf as before unless it be the party challenged then the forfeiture is to the commonwealth      in any other way death by hangingforfeiture of onehalf as before      manslaughter the second offence is murder   ii crimes whose punishment goes to limb     rape    dismemberment     sodomy    dismemberment     maiming    retaliation and the forfeiture of half of the lands and goods to the sufferer     disfiguring    retaliation and the forfeiture of half of the lands and goods to the sufferer   iii crimes punishable by labour     manslaughter  st offence   labor vii years for the public   forfeiture of half as in murder     counterfeiting money   labor vi years   forfeiture of lands and goods to the commonwealth         arson   labor v years   reparation threefold     asportation of vessels           robbery   labor iv years   reparation double     burglary           housebreaking   labor iii years   reparation     horsestealing           grand larceny   labor ii years   reparation pillory    0 petty larceny   labor i year   reparation pillory      pretensions to witchcraft c   ducking   stripes      excusable homicide   to be pitied not punished         suicide            apostacy heresy              pardon and privilege of clergy are proposed to be abolished but if the verdict be against the defendant the court in their discretion may allow a new trial no attainder to cause a corruption of blood or forfeiture of dower slaves guilty of offences punishable in others by labour to be transported to africa or elsewhere as the circumstances of the time admit there to be continued in slavery a rigorous regimen proposed for those condemned to labour another object of the revisal is to diffuse knowledge more generally through the mass of the people this bill proposes to lay off every country into small districts of five or six miles square called hundreds and in each of them to establish a school for teaching reading writing and arithmetic the tutor to be supported by the hundred and every person in it entitled to send their children three years gratis and as much longer as they please paying for it these schools to be under a visitor who is annually to chuse the boy of best genius in the school of those whose parents are too poor to give them further education    and to send him forward to one of the grammar schools of which twen    ty are proposed to be erected in different parts of the country for teaching greek latin geography and the higher branches of numerical arithmetic of the boys thus sent in any one year trial is to be made at the grammar schools one or two years and the best genius of the whole selected and continued six years and the residue dismissed by this means twenty of the best geniuses will be raked from the rubbish annually and be instructed at the public expence so far as the grammar schools go at the end of six years instruction one half are to be discontinued from among whom the grammar schools will probably be supplied with future masters and the other half who are to be chosen for the superiority of their parts and disposition are to be sent and continued three years in the study of such sciences as they shall chuse at william and mary college the plan of which is proposed to be enlarged as will be hereafter explained and extended to all the useful sciences the ultimate result of the whole scheme of education would be the teaching all the children of the state reading writing and common arithmetic turning out ten annually of su   0 perior genius well taught in greek latin geography and the higher branches of arithmetic turning out ten others annually of still superior parts who to those branches of learning shall have added such of the sciences as their genius shall have them led to the furnishing to the wealthier part of the people convenient schools at which their children may be    educated at their own expence—the general objects of this law are to provide an education adapted to the years to the capacity and the condition of every one and directed to their freedom and happiness specific details were not proper for the law these must be the business of the visitors entrusted with its execution the first stage of this education being the schools of the hundreds wherein the great mass of the people will receive their instruction the principal foundations of future order will be laid here instead therefore of putting the bible and testament into the hands of the children at an age when their judgments are not sufficiently matured for religious inquiries their memories may here be stored with the most useful facts from grecian roman european and american history the first     elements of morality too may be instilled into their minds such as when further developed as their judgments advance in strength may teach them how to work out their own greatest happiness by shewing them that it does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed them but is always the result of a good conscience good health occupation and freedom in all just pursuits—those whom either the wealth of their parents or the adoption of the state shall destine to higher degrees of learning will go on to the grammar schools which constitute the next stage there to be instructed in the languages the learning greek and latin i am told is going into disuse in europe i know not what their manners and occupations may call for but it would be very illjudged in us    to follow their example in this instance there is a certain period of life say from eight to fifteen or sixteen years of age when the mind like the body is not yet firm enough for laborious and close operations if applied to such it falls an early victim to premature exertion exhibiting indeed at first in these young and tender subjects the flattering appearance of their be    ing men while they are yet children but ending in reducing them to be children when they should be men the memory is then most susceptible and tenacious of impressions and the learning of languages being chiefly a work of memory it seems precisely fitted to the powers of this period which is long enough too for acquiring the most useful languages antient and modern i do not pretend that language is science it is only an instrument for the attainment of science but that time is not lost which is employed in providing tools for future operation more especially as in this case the books put into the hands of the youth for this purpose may be such as will at the same time impress their minds with useful facts and good principles if this period be suffered to pass in idleness the mind becomes lethargic and impotent as would the body it inhabits if unexercised during the same time the sympathy between body and mind during their rise progress and decline is too strict and obvious to endanger our being misled while we reason from the one to the other—as soon as they are of sufficient age it is supposed they will be sent on from the grammar schools to the     university which constitutes our    third and last stage there to study those sciences which may be adapted to their views—by that part of our plan which prescribes the selection of the youths of genius from among the classes of the poor we hope to avail the state of those talents which nature has shown as liberally among the poor as the rich but which perish without use if not sought for and cultivated—but of all the views of this law none is more important none more legitimate than that of rendering the people the safe as they are the ultimate guardians of their own liberty for this purpose the reading in the first stage where they will receive their whole education is proposed as has been said to be chiefly historical history by apprising them of the past will enable them to judge of the future it will avail them of the experience of other times and other nations it will qualify them as judges of the actions and designs of men it will enable them to know ambition under every disguise it may assume and knowing it to defeat its views in every government on earth is some trace of human weakness some germ of corruption and degene    racy which cunning will discover and wickedness insensibly open cultivate and improve every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone the people themselves therefore are its only safe depositories and to render even them safe their minds must be improved to a certain degree this indeed is not all that is necessary though it be essentially necessary an amendment of our constitution must here come in aid of the public education the influence over    government must be shared among all the people if every individual which composes their mass participates of the ultimate authority the government will be safe because the corrupting the whole mass will exceed any private resources of wealth and public ones cannot be provided but by levies on the people in this case every man would have to pay his own price the government of great britain has been corrupted because but one man in ten has a right to vote for members of parliament the sellers of the government therefore get ninetenths of their price clear it has been thought that corruption is restrained by confining the right of suffrage to a few of the wealthier of the people but     it would be more effectually restrained by an extension of that right to such members as would bid defiance to the means of corruption lastly it is proposed by a bill in this revisal to begin a public library and gallery by laying out a certain sum annually in books paintings and statues query xv the colleges and public establishments the roads buildings c the college of william and mary is the only public seminary of learning in this state it was founded in the time of king william and queen mary who granted to it  0000 acres of land and a penny a pound duty on certain tobaccoes exported from virginia and maryland which had been levied by    the statute of    car ii the assembly also gave it by temporary laws a duty on liquors imported and skins and furs exported from these resources it received upwards of  000l communibus annis the buildings are of brick sufficient for an indifferent accommo     dation of perhaps an hundred students by its charter it was to be under the government of twenty visitors who were to be its legislators and to have a president and six professors who were incorporated it was allowed a representative in the general assembly under this charter a professorship of the greek and latin languages a professorship of mathematics one of moral philosophy and two of divinity were established to these were annexed for a sixth professorship a considerable donation by mr boyle of england for the instruction of the indians and their conversion to christianity this was called the professorship of brafferton from an estate of that name in england purchased with the monies given the admission of the learners of latin and greek filled the college with children this rendering it disagreeable and degrading to young gentlemen already prepared for entering on the sciences they were discouraged from resorting to it and thus the schools for mathematics and moral philosophy which might have been of some service became of very little the revenues too were exhausted in accommodating those who came only     to acquire the rudiments of science after the present revolution the visitors having no power to change those circumstances in the constitution of    the college which were fixed by the charter and being therefore confined in the number of professorships undertook to change the objects of the professorships they excluded the two schools for divinity and that for the greek and latin languages and substituted others so that at present they stand thus a professorship for law and police anatomy and medicine natural philosophy and mathematics moral philosophy the law of nature and nations the fine arts modern languages for the brafferton and it is proposed so soon as the legislature shall have leisure to take up this subject to desire authority from them to increase the number of professorships as well for the purpose of subdividing those already instituted as of adding others for other branches of science to the professorships usually established in the universities of europe it     would seem proper to add one for the ancient languages and literature of the north on account of their connection with our own language laws customs and history the purposes of the brafferton institution would be better answered by maintaining a perpetual mission among the indian tribes the object of which besides instructing them in the principles of christianity as the founder requires should be to collect their traditions laws customs languages and other circumstances which might lead to a discovery of their relation with one another    or descent from other nations when these objects are accomplished with one tribe the missionary might pass on to another the roads are under the government of the county courts subject to be controuled by the general court they order new roads to be opened wherever they think them necessary the inhabitants of the county are by them laid off into precincts to each of which they allot a convenient portion of the public roads to be kept in repair such bridges as may be built without the assistance of artificers they are to build if the stream be such as to require a bridge of regular     workmanship the court employs workmen to build it at the expence of the whole county if it be too great for the county application is made to the general assembly who authorize individuals to build it and to take a fixed toll from all passengers or give sanction to such other proposition as to them appears reasonable ferries are admitted only at such places as are particularly pointed out by law and the rates of ferriage are fixed taverns are licensed by the courts who fix their rates from time to time the private buildings are very rarely constructed of stone or brick much the greatest proportion being of scantling and boards plaistered with lime it is impossible to devise things more ugly uncomfortable and happily more perishable there are two or three plans on one of which according to its size most of the houses in the state are built the poorest people build huts of logs laid horizontally    in pens stopping the interstices with mud these are warmer in winter and cooler in summer than the more expensive constructions of scantling and plank the wealthy are attentive to the raising of   0 vegetables but very little so to fruits the poorer people attend to neither living principally on milk and animal diet this is the more inexcusable as the climate requires indispensably a free use of vegetable food for health as well as comfort and is very friendly to the raising of fruits—the only public buildings worthy mention are the capitol the palace the college and the hospital for lunatics all of them in williamsburg heretofore the seat of our government the capitol is a light and airy structure with a portico in front of two orders the lower of which being doric is tolerably just in its proportions and ornaments save only that the intercolonnations are too large the upper is ionic much too small for that on which it is mounted its ornaments not proper to the order nor proportioned within themselves it is crowned with a pediment which is too high for its span yet on the whole it is the most pleasing piece of architecture we have the palace is not handsome without but it is spacious and commodious within is prettily situated and with the grounds annexed to it is capable of being made an elegant seat the col     lege and hospital are rude misshapen piles which but that they have roofs would be taken for brickkilns there are no other public buildings but churches and courthouses in which no attempts are made at  0 elegance indeed it would not be easy to execute such an attempt as a workman could scarcely be found here capable of drawing an order the genius of architecture seems to have shed its maledictions over this land buildings are often erected by individuals of considerable expence to give these symmetry and taste would not increase their cost it would only change the arrangement of the materials the form and combination of the members this would often cost less than the burthen of barbarous ornaments with which these buildings are sometimes charged but the first principles of the art are unknown and there exists scarcely a model among us sufficiently chaste to give an idea of them architecture being one of the fine arts and as such within the department of a professor of the college according to the new arrangement perhaps a spark may fall on some young subjects of natural taste kindle up their genius and produce a reforma     tion in this elegant and useful art but all we shall do in this way will produce no permanent improvement to our country while the unhappy prejudice prevails that houses of brick or stone are less wholesome than those of wood a dew is often observed on the walls of the former in rainy weather and the most obvious solution is that the rain has penetrated through these walls the following facts however are sufficient to prove the error of this solution   this dew on the walls appears when there is no rain if the state of the atmosphere be moist   it appears on the partition as well as the exterior walls   so also on    pavements of brick or stone   it is more copious in proportion as the walls are thicker the reverse of which ought to be the case if this hypothesis were just if cold water be poured into a vessel of stone or glass a dew forms instantly on the outside but if it be poured into a vessel of wood there is no such appearance it is not supposed in the first case that the water has exuded through the glass but that it is precipitated from the circumambient air as the humid particles of vapour passing from the boiler of an alembic     through its refrigerant are precipitated from the air in which they were suspended on the internal surface of the refrigerant walls of brick or stone act as the refrigerant in this instance they are sufficiently cold to condense and precipitate the moisture suspended in the air of the room when it is heavily charged therewith but walls of wood are not so the question then is whether air in which this moisture is left floating or that which is deprived of it be most wholesome in both cases the remedy is easy a little fire kindled in the room whenever the air is damp prevents the precipitation on the walls and this practice found healthy in the warmest as well as coldest seasons is as necessary in a wooden as in a stone or a brick house i do not mean to say that the rain never penetrates through walls of brick on the contrary i have seen instances of it but with us it is only through the northern and eastern walls of the house after a northeasterly storm these being the only ones which continue long enough to force through the    walls this however happens too rarely to give a just character of unwholesomeness to such     houses in a house the walls of which are of wellburnt brick and good mortar i have seen the rain penetrate through but twice in a dozen or fifteen years the inhabitants of europe who dwell chiefly in houses of stone or brick are surely as healthy as those of virginia these houses have the advantage too of being warmer in winter and cooler in summer than those of wood of being cheaper in their first construction where lime is convenient and infinitely more durable the latter consideration renders it of great importance to eradicate this prejudice from the minds of our countrymen a country whose buildings are of wood can never increase in its improvements to any considerable degree their duration is highly estimated at  0 years every half century then our country becomes a tabula rasa whereon we have to set out anew as in the first moment of seating it whereas when buildings are of durable materials every new edifice is an actual and permanent acquisition to the state adding to its value as well as to its ornament     query xvi the measures taken with regard of the estates and possessions of the rebels commonly called tories a tory has been properly defined to be a traitor in thought but not in deed the only description    by which the laws have endeavoured to come at them was that of nonjurors or persons refusing to take the oath of fidelity to the state persons of this description were at one time subjected to double taxation at another treble and lastly were allowed retribution and placed on a level with good citizens it may be mentioned as a proof both of the lenity of our government and unanimity of its inhabitants that though this war has now raged near seven years not a single execution for treason has taken place under this query i will state the measures which have been adopted as to british property the owners of which stand on a much fairer footing than the tories by our laws the same as the english as in this respect     no alien can hold lands nor alien enemy maintain an action for money or other movable thing lands acquired or held by aliens become forfeited to the state and on an action by an alien enemy to recover money or other movable property the defendant may plead that he is an alien enemy this extinguishes his right in the hands of the debtor or holder of his movable property by our separation from great britain british subjects became aliens and being at war they were alien enemies their lands were of course forfeited and their debts irrecoverable the assembly however passed laws at various times for saving their property they first sequestered their lands slaves and other property on their farms in the hands of commissioners who were mostly the confidential friends or agents of the owners and directed    their clear profits to be paid into the treasury and they gave leave to all persons owing debts to british subjects to pay them also into the treasury the monies so to be brought in were declared to remain the property of the british subject and if used by the state were to be repaid unless an improper conduct in greatbritain should ren     der a detention of it reasonable depreciation had at that time though unacknowledged and unperceived by the whigs begun in some small degree great sums of money were paid in by debtors at a later period the assembly adhering to the political principles which forbid an alien to hold lands in the state ordered all british property to be sold and become sensible of the real progress of depreciation and of the losses which would thence occur if not guarded against they ordered that the proceeds of the sales should be converted into their then worth in tobacco subject to the future direction of the legislature this act has left the question of retribution more problematical in may    0 another act took away the permission to pay into the public treasury debts due to british subjects query xvii the different religions received into that state the first settlers in this country were emigrants from england of the english church     just at a point of time when it was flushed with complete victory over the religious of all other persuasions possessed as they became of the powers of making    administering and executing the laws they shewed equal intolerance in this country with their presbyterian brethren who had emigrated to the northern government the poor quakers were flying from persecution in england they cast their eyes on these new countries as asylums of civil and religious freedom but they found them free only for the reigning sect several acts of the virginia assembly of           and      had made it penal in parents to refuse to have their children baptized had prohibited the unlawful assembling of quakers had made it penal for any master of a vessel to bring a quaker into the state had ordered those already here and such as should come thereafter to be imprisoned till they should abjure the country provided a milder punishment for their first and second return but death for their third had inhibited all persons from suffering their meetings in or near their houses entertaining them individually or disposing of books which supported their     tenets if no capital execution took place here as did in newengland it was not owing to the moderation of the church or spirit of the legislature as may be inferred from the law itself but to historical circumstances which have not been handed down to us the anglicans retained full possession of the country about a century other opinions began then to creep in and the great care of the government to support their own church having begotten an equal degree of indolence in its clergy two thirds of the people had become dissenters at the commencement of the present revolution the laws    indeed were still oppressive on them but the spirit of the one party had subsided into moderation and of the other had risen to a degree of determination which commanded respect the present state of our laws on the subject of religion is this the convention of may      in their declaration of rights declared it to be a truth and a natural right that the exercise of religion should be free but when they proceeded to form on that declaration the ordinance of government instead of taking up every principle declared   0 in the bill of rights and guarding it by legislative sanction they passed over that which asserted our religious rights leaving them as they found them the same convention however when they met as a member of the general assembly in october      repealed all acts of parliament which had rendered criminal the maintaining any opinions in matters of religion the forbearing to repair to church and the exercising any mode of worship and suspended the laws giving salaries to the clergy which suspension was made perpetual in october      statutory oppressions in religion being thus wiped away we remain at present under those only imposed by the common law or by our own acts of assembly at the common law heresy was a capital offence punishable by burning its definition was left to the ecclesiastical judges before whom the conviction was till the statute of the   el c   circumscribed it by declaring that nothing should be deemed heresy but what had been so determined by authority of the canonical scriptures or by one    of the four first general councils or by some other council having for the grounds of their declaration the     express and plain words of the scriptures heresy thus circumscribed being an offence at the common law our act of assembly of october      c    gives cognizance of it to the general court by declaring that the jurisdiction of that court shall be general in all matters at the common law the execution is by the writ de hæretico comburendo by our own act of assembly of   0  c  0 if a person brought up in the christian religion denies the being of a god or the trinity or asserts there are more gods than one or denies the christian religion to be true or the scriptures to be of divine authority he is punishable on the first offence by incapacity to hold any office or employment ecclesiastical civil or military on the second by disability to sue to take any gift or legacy to be guardian executor or administrator and by three years imprisonment without bail a fathers right to the custody of his own children being founded in law on his right of guardianship this being taken away they may of course be severed from him and put by the authority of a court into more orthodox hands this is a summary view of that religious slavery     under which a people have been willing to remain who have lavished their lives and fortunes for the establishment of their civil freedom the error seems not sufficiently eradicated that the operations of the mind as well as the acts of the body are subject to the coercion of the laws  but our rulers can have    authority over such natural rights only as we have submitted to them the rights of conscience we never submitted we could not submit we are answerable for them to our god the legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others  but it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg if it be said his testimony in a court of justice cannot be relied on reject it then and be the stigma on him constraint may make him worse by making him a hypocrite but it will never make him a truer man it may fix him obstinately in his errors but will not cure     them reason and free inquiry are the only effectual agents against error give a loose to them they will support the true religion by bringing every false one to their tribunal to the test of their investigation they are the natural enemies of error and of error only had not the roman government permitted free inquiry christianity could never have been introduced had not free inquiry been indulged at the æra of the reformation the corruptions of christianity could not have been purged away if it be restrained now the present corruptions will be protected and new ones encouraged was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now thus in france the emetic was once forbidden as a medicine and the    potatoe as an article of food  government is just as infallible too when it fixes systems in physics galileo was sent to the inquisition for affirming that the earth was a sphere the government had declared it to be as flat as a trencher and galileo was obliged to abjure his error this error however at length prevailed the earth became a globe and descartes declared     it was whirled round its axis by a vortex the government in which he lived was wise enough to see that this was no question of civil jurisdiction or we should all have been involved by authority in vortices in fact the vortices have been exploded and the newtonian principles of gravitation is now more firmly established on the basis of reason than it would be were the government to step in and to make it an article of necessary faith reason and experiment have been indulged and error has fled before them it is error alone which needs the support of government truth can stand by itself subject opinion to coercion whom will you make your inquisitors fallible men men governed by bad passions by private as well as public reasons and why subject it to coercion to produce uniformity but is uniformity of opinion desireable no more than of face and stature introduce the bed of procrustes then and as there is danger that the large men may beat the small make us all of a size by lopping the former and stretching the latter difference of opinion  0 is advantageous in religion the several sects perform the office of a censor morum over     each other is uniformity attainable millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined imprisoned yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity what has been the effect of coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thousand millions of people that these profess probably a thousand different systems of religion that ours is but one of that thousand that if there be but one right and ours that one we should wish to see the     wandering sects gathered into the fold of truth but against such a majority we cannot effect this by force reason and persuasion are the only practicable instruments to make way for these free inquiry must be indulged and how can we wish others to indulge it while we refuse it ourselves but every state says an inquisitor has established some religion no two say i have established the same is this a proof of the infallibility of establishments our sister states of pennsylvania     and new york however have long subsisted without any establishment at all the experiment was new and doubtful when they made it it has answered beyond conception they flourish infinitely religion is well supported of various kinds indeed but all good enough all sufficient to preserve peace and order or if a sect arises whose tenets would subvert morals    good sense has fair play and reasons and laughs it out of doors without suffering the state to be troubled with it they do not hang more malefactors than we do they are not more disturbed with religious dissentions on the contrary their harmony is unparallelled and can be ascribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance because there is no other circumstance in which they differ from every nation on earth they have made the happy discovery that the way to silence religious disputes is to take no notice of them let us too give this experiment fair play and get rid while we may of those tyrannical laws it is true we are as yet secured against them by the spirit of the times i doubt whether the people of this country would suffer an execution for heresy or a three years imprisonment for not     comprehending the mysteries of the trinity but is the spirit of the people an infallible a permanent reliance is it government is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up besides the spirit of the times may alter will alter our rulers will become corrupt our people careless a single zealot may commence persecuter and better men be his victims it can never be too often repeated that the time for fixing every essential right on a legal basis is while our rulers are honest and ourselves united from the conclusion of this war we shall be going down hill it will not then be necessary to resort every moment to the people for support they will be forgotten therefore and their rights disregarded they will forget themselves but in the    sole faculty of making money and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights the shackles therefore which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war will remain on us long will be made heavier and heavier till our rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion     query xviii the particular customs and manners that may happen to be received in that state it is difficult to determine on the standard by which the manners of a nation may be tried whether catholic or particular it is more difficult for a native to bring to that standard the manners of his own nation familiarized to him by habit there must doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of our people produced by the existence of slavery among us the whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions the most unremitting despotism on the one part and degrading submissions on the other our children see this and learn to imitate it for man is an imitative animal this quality is the germ of all education in him from his cradle to his grave he is learning to do what he sees others do if a parent could find no motive either in his philanthropy or his selflove for restraining the intemperance of passion towards his slave it     should always be a sufficient one that his child is present but generally it is not sufficient the parent storms the child looks on catches the    lineaments of wrath puts on the same airs in the circle of smaller slaves gives a loose to the worst of passions and thus nursed educated and daily exercised in tyranny cannot but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities the man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such circumstances and with what execrations should the statesman be loaded who permitting one half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of the other transforms those into despots and these into enemies destroys the morals of the one part and the amor patriæ of the other for if a slave can have a country in this world it must be any other in preference to that in which he is born to live and labour for another in which he must lock up the faculties of his nature contribute as far as depends on his individual endeavours to the evanishment of the human race or entail his own miserable condition on the endless generations proceeding from him with the morals of the people their industry also is  00 destroyed for in a warm climate no man will labour for himself who can make another labour for him this is so true that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour and can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of god that they are not to be violated but with his wrath indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever that considering numbers nature and natural means    only a revolution of the wheel of fortune an exchange of situation is among possible events that it may become probable by supernatural interference the almighty has no attribute which can take side with us in such a contest—but it is impossible to be temperate and to pursue this subject through the various considerations of policy of morals of history natural and civil we must be contented to hope they will force their way into every ones mind i think a change already perceptible since the origin of the present revolution the spirit of the master is  0  abating that of the slave rising from the dust his condition mollifying the way i hope preparing under the auspices of heaven for a total emancipation and that this is disposed in the order of events to be with the consent of the masters rather than by their extirpation query xix the present state of manufactures commerce interior and exterior trade we never had an interior trade of any importance our exterior commerce has suffered very much from the beginning of the present contest during this time we have manufactured within our families the most necessary articles of cloathing those of cotton will bear some comparison with the same kinds of manufacture in europe but those of wool flax and hemp are very coarse unsightly and unpleasant and such is our attachment to agriculture and such our preference for foreign manufactures    that it be wise or unwise our people will certainly re  0  turn as soon as they can to the raising raw materials and exchanging them for finer manufactures than they are able to execute themselves the political œconomists of europe have established it as a principle that every state should endeavour to manufacture for itself and this principle like many others we transfer to america without calculating the difference of circumstance which should often produce a difference of result in europe the lands are either cultivated or locked up against the cultivator manufacture must therefore be resorted to of necessity not of choice to support the surplus of their people but we have an immensity of land courting the industry of the husbandman is it best then that all our citizens should be employed in its improvement or that one half should be called off from that to exercise manufactures and handicraft arts for the other those who labour in the earth are the chosen people of god if ever he had a chosen people whose breasts he has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue it is the focus in which he keeps alive that sacred fire which otherwise  0  might escape from the face of the earth corruption of morals in the mass of cultivators is a phænomenon of which no age nor nation has furnished an example it is the mark set on those who not looking up to heaven to their own soil and industry as does the husbandman for their subsistence depend for it on casualties and caprice of customers dependance begets subservience and venality suffocates the germ of    virtue and prepares fit tools for the designs of ambition this the natural progress and consequence of the arts has sometimes perhaps been retarded by accidental circumstances but generally speaking the proportion which the aggregate of the other classes of citizens bears in any state to that of its husbandmen is the proportion of its unsound to its healthy parts and is a good enough barometer whereby to measure its degree of corruption while we have land to labour then let us never wish to see our citizens occupied at a workbench or twirling a distaff carpenters masons smiths are wanting in husbandry but for the general operations of manufacture let our workshops remain in europe it is better to carry provisions and materials to work  0  men there than bring them to the provisions and materials and with them their manners and principles the loss by the transportation of commodities across the atlantic will be made up in happiness and permanence of government the mobs of great cities add just so much to the support of pure government as sores do to the strength of the human body it is the manners and spirit of a people which preserve a republic in vigour a degeneracy in these is a canker which soon eats to the heart of its laws and constitution     query xx a notice of the commercial productions particular to the state and of those objects which the inhabitants are obliged to get from europe and from other parts of the world before the present war we exported communibus annis according to the best information i can get nearly as follows  0  articles quantity price in dollars amount in dollars

guineas—t j  0     in the year      we exported seventy thousand hogsheads of tobacco which was the greatest quantity ever produced in this country in one year but its culture was fast declining at the commencement of this war and that of wheat taking its place and it must continue to decline on the return of peace i suspect that the change in the temperature of our climate has become sensible to that plant which to be good requires an extraordinary degree of heat but it requires still more indispensably an uncommon fertility of soil and the price which it commands at market will not enable the planter to produce this by manure was the supply still to depend on virginia and maryland alone as its culture becomes more difficult the price would rise so as to enable the planter to surmount those difficulties and to live but the western country on the missisipi and the midlands of georgia having fresh and fertile lands in abundance and a hotter sun will be able to undersell these two states and will oblige them to abandon the raising of tobacco altogether and a happy obligation for them it will be it is a culture productive of infinite wretchedness  0  those employed in it are in a continual state of exertion beyond the power of nature to    support little food of any kind is raised by them so that the men and animals on these farms are illy fed and the earth is rapidly impoverished the cultivation of wheat is the reverse in every circumstance besides cloathing the earth with herbage and preserving its fertility it feeds the labourers plentifully requires from them only a moderate toil except in the season of harvest raises great numbers of animals for food and service and diffuses plenty and happiness among the whole we find it easier to make an hundred bushels of wheat than a thousand weight of tobacco and they are worth more when made the weavil indeed is a formidable obstacle to the cultivation of this grain with us but principles are already known which must lead to a remedy thus a certain degree of heat to wit that of the common air in summer is necessary to hatch the eggs if subterranean granaries or others therefore can be contrived below that temperature the evil will be cured by cold a degree of heat beyond that which hatches the egg we know will  0  kill it but in aiming at this we easily run into that which produced putrefaction to produce putrefaction however three agents are requisite heat moisture and the external air if the absence of any one of these be secured the other two may safely be admitted heat is the one we want moisture then or external air must be excluded the former has been done by exposing the grain in kilns to the action of fire which produces heat and extracts moisture at the same time the latter by putting the grain into hogsheads covering it with a  0 coating of lime and heading it up in this situation its bulk produced a heat sufficient to kill the egg the moisture is suffered to remain indeed but the external air is excluded a nicer operation yet has been attempted that is to produce an intermediate temperature of heat between that which kills the egg and that which produces putrefaction the threshing the grain as soon as it is cut and laying it in its chaff in large heaps has been found very nearly to hit this temperature though not perfectly nor always the heap generates heat sufficient to kill most of the eggs whilst the chaff commonly restrains it from rising into putrefaction but all these  0  methods abridge too much the quantity which the farmer can manage and enable other countries to undersell him which are not infested with this insect there is still a desideratum then to give with us decisive triumph to this branch of agriculture over that of tobacco—the culture of wheat by enlarging our pasture will render the arabian horse an article of very considerable profit experience has shown that ours is the particular climate of america where he may be raised without degeneracy southwardly the heat of the sun occasions a deficiency of pasture and northwardly the winters are too cold for the short and fine hair the particular sensibility and constitution of that race animals transplanted into unfriendly climates either change their nature and acquire new senses against the new difficulties in which they are placed or they multiply poorly and become extinct a good foundation is laid for their propagation here    by our possessing already great numbers of horses of that blood and by a decided taste and preference for them established among the people their patience of heat without injury their superior wind fit them better in this and the more southern climates even for the drudge   0 ries of the plough and wagon northwardly they will become an object only to persons of taste and fortune for the saddle and light carriages to these and for these uses their fleetness and beauty will recommend them—besides these there will be other valuable substitutes when the cultivation of tobacco shall be discontinued such as cotton in the eastern parts of the state and hemp and flax in the western it is not easy to say what are the articles either of necessity comfort or luxury which we cannot raise and which we therefore shall be under a necessity of importing from abroad as everything hardier than the olive and as hardy as the fig may be raised here in the open air sugar coffee and tea indeed are not between these limits and habit having placed them among the necessaries of life with the wealthy part of our citizens as long as these habits remain we must go for them to those countries which are able to furnish them     query xxi the weights measures and the currency of the hard money some details relating to exchange with europe our weights and measures are the same which are fixed by acts of parliament in england—how it    has happened that in this as well as the other american states the nominal value of coin was made to differ from what it was in the country we had left and to differ among ourselves too i am not able to say with certainty i find that in      our house of burgesses desired of the privy council in england a coin debased to twentyfive per cent that in      they forbid dealing by barter for tobacco and established the spanish piece of eight at six shillings as the standard of their currency that in      they changed it to five shillings sterling in    0 they sent an address to the king in consequence of which by proclamation in      he fixed the value of french crowns rixdollars and pieces of eight at six shillings and the coin of new england at one shilling that in    0           and      other regulations were made which will be better presented to the eye stated in the form of a table as follows         0                guineas       s          british gold coin not milled gold coin of spain and france chequins arabian gold moidores of portugal      s dwt   coined

edition of      the following footnote is added in the states the dollar is valued at  s the coincidence of their currency with the greek and roman moneys is so singular as to be worthy of notice and to found a suspicion that this object may have had some influence in fixing our moneys at this particular point at a time when the value of greek and roman learning was more justly estimated than at this day the penny lawful is precisely the roman as which was their unit  0 of which equal to ten pence lawful made the attic drachma according to pliny l    c    in the latter ages of their history the moneys of these two people were interwoven so as to make parts of the same series which were in some degree decimal the as l at first libralis but latterly ½ an ounce of copper and called libella   d lawful  0 as made the denarius x or attic drachm   0d  00 denarii made the mina or pondo   000d or £   s  d the denarius having been divided into fourths of  ½ as each the fourth was called a

000 it is understood that the attic drachm of silver was exactly our drachm troy of  0 grains the denarius of the romans was the  th part of their ounce which is supposed to have been exactly our avoirdupois ounce but this is of    ½ grains troy which would make the roman denarius   ½ grains and consequently     more than the attic drachm contrary to the testimony of antiquity that the denarius and drachm were equal we may very probably conjecture that our troy weight is taken from the grecians from whom our physicians derive their science and in copying their receipts would of course preserve their weights which fix the quantum and proportion of ingredients we may as probably affirm that our avoirdupois weight it taken from the romans from whom through their colonies and conquests in france spain germany britain we derive our agriculture and commerce accordingly we observe that while we weigh our physic by the troy or grecian weights we use the avoirdupois or roman for the productions of agriculture and general articles of commerce and since antiquity affirms that these two series were united by the equality of the drachm and denarius we must conclude that in progress of time they have become a little separated in use with us to wit     part as before noted but the point at which their separation has been arrested and fixed is a very remarkable one  000 ounces avoirdupois make exactly a cubic foot of water this integral decimal and cubical relation induces a presumption that while deciding amongst the varieties and uncertainties which during the ruder ages of arts we know had crept into the weights and measures of england they had adopted for their standard those which stood so conveniently connected through the medium of a natural element always at hand to be appealed to the ounce avoirdupois being thus fixed at the thousandth part of a cubic foot of water the winchester bushel of    0  cubic inches filled with water would weigh     lb avoirdupois and filled with wheat of statute quality weighed    lb amidst the varieties discovered between the standard weights avoirdupois and troy in their different depositories it would be discovered that all of them were a little over or under this proportion and this would suffice to give this proportion the preference and to fix the standard relation between the avoirdupois and troy pounds at that which nature has established between the weights of water and wheat and the troy grain    0 of which make the pound troy would be so adjusted as that  000 of them would make the pound avoirdupois—for  000    0       exactly the same proportion is known to exist between the dry and liquid measures—for the corn gallon contains     cubic inches and the ancient liquid gallon of guildhall     cubic inches—so that the system of weights and measures avoirdupois and troy dry and liquid are found to be in the simple relation of the weights and measures of the two obvious and natural subjects water and wheat that is to say the pound avoirdupoise pound troy  the weight of water weight of wheat  the bulk of the corn gallon  the bulk of the liquid gallon or  000    0                these weights and measures seem to have been so combined as to render it immaterial whether a commodity was dealt out by weight or measure for the dry gallon of wheat and the liquid one of wine were of the same weight and the avoirdupois pound of wheat and the troy pound of wine were of the same measure a more natural accurate and curious reconciliation of the two systems of greece and rome which happened to be found in use could not have been imagined and the extension of the connection from weights and measures to coins as is done so integrally by our lawful currency which makes the penny of   grains of silver as was the roman as has completed the system it is true we find no trace either in english or american history that these were the views which determined the relation existing between our weights measures and moneys but it is more difficult to conceive that such a series of combinations should have been merely accidental and that history should have been silent about them i am aware that there are differences of opinion as to the ancient weights and coins those here stated are taken from brerewood kennet ainsworth and the enclyclopedia and are as likely to have prevailed with our ancestors as the opinions opposed to them    the first symptom of the depreciation of our present papermoney was that of silver dollars selling at six shillings which had before been worth but five shillings and ninepence the assembly thereupon raised them by law to six shillings as the dollar is now likely to become the moneyunit of america as it passes at this rate in some of our sisterstates and as it facilitates their computation in pounds and shillings c e converso this seems    to be more convenient than its former denomination but as this particular coin now stands higher than any other in the proportion of    ½ to     or    to    it will be necessary to raise the others in proportion query xxii the public income and expences the nominal amount of these varying constantly and rapidly with the constant and rapid depreciation    of our papermoney it becomes impracticable to say what they are we find ourselves cheated in every essay by the depreciation intervening between the     declaration of the tax and its actual receipt it will therefore be more satisfactory to consider what our income may be when we shall find means of collecting what our people may spare i should estimate the whole taxable property of this state at an hundred millions of dollars or thirty millions of pounds our money one per cent    on this compared with anything we ever yet paid would be deemed a very heavy tax yet i think that those who manage well and use reasonable œconomy could pay one and a half per cent and maintain their household comfortably in the meantime without aliening any part of their principal and that the people would submit to this willingly for the purpose of supporting their present contest we may say then that we could raise and ought to raise from one million to one million and a half of dollars annually that is from three hundred to four hundred and fifty thousand pounds virginia money of our expences it is equally difficult to give an exact state and for the same reason they are mostly stated in paper money which varying continually the legislature endeavors at every session by new cor     rections to adapt the nominal sums to the value it is wished they would bear i will state them therefore in real coin at the point at which they endeavor to keep them  dollars the annual expenses of the general assembly are about  0000 the governor     ½ the council of state  0   ⅔ their clerks     ⅔ eleven judges   000 the clerk of the chancery    ⅔ the attorney general  000 three auditors and a solicitor     ⅓ their clerks  000 the treasurer  000 his clerks  000 the keeper of the public jail  000 the public printer     ⅔ clerks of the inferior courts      ½ public levy this is chiefly for the expenses of criminal justice  0000 county levy for bridges courthouses prisons c      0000 members of congress  000 quota of the federal civil list supposed ⅙ of about   000 dollars   000 expences of collecting six per cent on the above     0  the clergy received only voluntary contributions suppose them on an average ⅛ of a dollar a tythe on  00000 tythes   000 contingencies to make round numbers not far from truth     ⅓     0000  altered in edition of      to     0  altered in edition of      to     ⅓ dollars or        guineas this estimate is exclusive of the military expence that varies with the force actually employed and in time of peace will probably be little or nothing it is exclusive also of the public debts which are growing while i am writing and cannot therefore be now fixed from these articles if we strike out that of  00000 dollars for the maintenance of the poor and   000 dollars for its collection which being merely a matter of charity cannot be deemed expended in the administration of government and the   000 dollars  for the services of the clergy which neither    makes     part of that administration more than what is paid to physicians or lawyers and being voluntary is either much or nothing as every one pleases it leaves    000 equal to       guineas the real cost of the apparatus of government with us this divided among the actual inhabitants of our country comes to about two fifths of a dollars   d sterling or    sols the price which each pays annually for the protection of the residue of his property that of his person and the other advantages of a free government the public revenues of great britain divided in like manner on its inhabitants would be sixteen times greater deducting the aggregate sum of   0000 dollars  from the million and a half of dollars which we before supposed might be annually paid without distress we may conclude that this state can contribute one million of dollars annually towards supporting the federal army paying the federal debt building a federal navy or opening roads clearing rivers forming safe ports and other useful works to this estimate of our abilities let me add a word as to the application of them if when cleared of the present contest and of     the debts with which that will charge us we come to measure force hereafter with any european power such events are devoutly to be deprecated young as we are and with such a country before us to fill with    people and with happiness we should point in that direction the whole generative force of nature wasting none of it in efforts of mutual destruction it should be our endeavor to cultivate the peace and friendship of every nation even of that which has injured us most when we shall have carried our point against her our interest will be to throw open the doors of commerce and to knock off all its shackles giving perfect freedom to all persons for the vent of whatever they may choose to bring into our ports and asking the same in theirs never was so much false arithmetic employed on any subject as that which has been employed to persuade nations that it is their interest to go to war were the money which it has cost to gain at the close of a long war a little town or a little territory the right to cut wood here or to catch fish there expended in improving what they already possess in making roads opening rivers building ports improving the arts     and finding employment for their idle poor it would render them much stronger much wealthier and happier this i hope will be our wisdom and perhaps to remove as much as possible the occasions of making war it might be better for us to abandon the ocean altogether that being the element whereon we shall be principally exposed to justle with other nations to leave to others to bring what we shall want and to carry what we can spare this would make us invulnerable to europe by offering none of our property to their prize and would turn all our citizens to the cultivation of the earth and i repeat  00 it again cultivators of the earth are the most virtuous and independant citizens it might be time enough to seek employment for them at sea when the land no longer offers it but the actual habits of our countrymen attach them to commerce they will exercise it for themselves wars then must sometimes be our lot and all the wise can do will be to avoid that half of them which would be produced by our own follies and our own acts of injustice and to make for the other half the best preparations we can of what nature should these be   0 a land army would be useless for offence and not the best nor safest instrument of defence for either of these purposes the sea is the field on which we should meet an european enemy on that element it is necessary we should possess some power to aim at such a navy as the greater nations of europe possess would be a foolish and wicked waste of the energies of our countrymen it would be to pull on our own heads that load of military expence which makes the european labourer go supperless to bed and moistens his bread with the sweat of his brows it will be enough if we enable ourselves to prevent insults from those nations of europe which are weak on the sea because circumstances exist which render even the stronger ones weak as to us providence has placed their richest and most defenceless possessions at our door has obliged their most precious commerce to pass as it were in review before us to protect this or to assail a small part only of their naval force will ever be risqued across the atlantic the  0  dangers to which the elements expose them here are too well known and the greater dangers to which they would be ex     posed at home were any general calamity to involve their whole fleet they can attack us by detachment only and it will suffice to make ourselves equal to what they may detach even a smaller force than they may detach will be rendered equal or superior by the quickness with which any check may be repaired with us while losses with them will be irreparable till too late a small naval force then is sufficient for us and a small one is necessary what this should be i will not undertake to say i will only say it should by no means be so great as we are able to make it suppose the million dollars or  00000 pounds which virginia could annually spare without distress to be applied to the creating a navy a single years contribution would build equip man and send to sea a force which should carry  00 guns the rest of the confederacy exerting themselves in the same proportion would equip in the same time   00 guns more so that one years contributions would set up a navy of   00 guns the british ships of the line average    guns their frigates      00 guns then would form a fleet of  0 ships    of which might     be of the line and    frigates allowing   men the british average for every gun their annual expence including subsistance cloathing pay and ordinary repairs would be about    0 dollars for every gun or   0 000 dollars for the whole i state this only as one years possible exertion without deciding  0  whether more or less than a years exertion should be thus applied the value of our lands and slaves taken conjunctly doubles in about twenty years this arises from the multiplication of our slaves from the extension of culture and increased demand for lands the amount of what may be raised will of course rise in the same proportion query xxiii the histories of the state the memorials published in its name in the time of its being a colony and the pamphlets relating to its interior or exterior affairs present or antient captain smith who next to sir walter raleigh may be considered as the founder     of our colony has written its history from the first adventures to it till the year      he was a member of the council and afterwards president of the colony and to his efforts principally may be ascribed its support against the opposition of the natives he was honest sensible and well informed but his style is barbarous and uncouth his history however is almost the only source from which we derive any knowledge of the infancy of our state the reverend william stith a native of virginia and president of its college has also written the history of the same period in a large octavo volume of small print he was a man of classical learning and very exact but of no taste in style he is  0  inelegant therefore and his details often too minute to be tolerable even to a native of the country whose history he writes beverley a native also has run into the other extreme he has comprised our history from the first propositions of sir walter raleigh to the year   00 in the hundredth part of the space which stith employs for the fourth part of the period     sir william keith has taken it up at its earliest period and continued it to the year      he is agreeable enough in style and passes over events of little importance of course he is short and would be preferred by a foreigner during the regal government some contest arose on the exaction of an illegal fee by governor dinwiddie and doubtless there were others on other occasions not at present recollected it is supposed that these are not sufficiently interesting to a foreigner to merit a detail the petition of the council and burgesses of virginia to the king their memorials to the lords and remonstrance to the commons in the year      began the present contest and these having proved ineffectual to prevent the passage of the stampact the resolutions of the house of burgesses of      were passed declaring the independance of the people of virginia of the parliament of great britain in matters of taxation from that time till the declaration of independnce by congress in      their journals are filled with assertions of the public rights      0  the pamphlets published in this state on the controverted question were      an

nicholas since the declaration of independance this state has had no controversy with any other except with that of pennsylvania on their common boundary some papers on this subject passed between the executive and legislative bodies of the two states the result of which was a happy accommodation of their rights to this account of our historians memorials and pamphlets it may not be unuseful to add a chronological catalogue of american statepapers as far as i have been able to collect their titles it is far from being either complete or correct where the title alone and not the paper itself has come under my observation i cannot an     swer for the exactness of the date sometimes i have not been able to find any date at all and sometimes have not been satisfied that such a paper exists an extensive collection of papers of this description has been for sometime in a course of preparation by a gentleman  fully equal to the task and from whom therefore we may hope ere long to receive it

writings     –             thomas jefferson jan         philadelphia francis eppes to francis eppes  philadelphia jan         dear sir —you will hardly expect to receive a letter from me at this place and of so late a date yet i have apprehensions of being here ten days or a fortnight longer for though ready myself some time since the vessel in which i go is not ready yesterdays post brought no mail from virginia i was not disappointed in this as i was pretty certain that under expectation of my being gone you did not write i had entertained some hope of meeting a letter from you on my first arrival here but suppose the same idea of its not coming in time prevented it so that at present i have no hope of hearing again while on this side of the water from yourself and family and those dear little ones i left with you we have heard nothing since my last from which the length of my absence may be conjectured the last authentic advices     were of the   th of october but the affair of gibraltar happened just then and the negotiation was in such a state that what had passed between the negotiators was at that time under submission to the british court for their approbation or disavowal how far this would be influenced by their good fortune at gibraltar is the question which the next advices must certainly solve since i came here there has been sold the westover copy of catesbys history of carolina it was held near a twelvemonth at twelve guineas and at last sold for ten this seems to fix what should be given for mr bollingss copy if you can induce him to let me have it which i am very anxious for perhaps it would be a temptation to offer that the ten guineas should be paid to mr rosss agent at nantes where he could lay them out and send the articles to mr bolling his draft shall be paid on sight in paris perhaps you had better effect this by making the proposition to mrs bolling of this your knowledge of the family will enable you to judge be so good as to present me most affectionately to mrs eppes mr and mrs skipwith and the two families and believe me to be with very great sincerity dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson jan         philade general washington to general washington j mss philade jan         sir —having lately recd a call from congress to pass the atlantic in the character of one of their ministers for negotiating peace i cannot leave the     continent without separating myself for a moment from the general gratitude of my country to offer my individual tribute to your excy for all you have suffered  all you have effected for us were i to indulge myself in those warm effusions which this subject forever prompts they would wear an appearance of adulation very foreign to my nature for such is become the prostitution of language that sincerity has no longer distinct terms in which to express her own truths should you give me occasion during the short mission on which i go to render you any service beyond the water i shall for a proof of my gratitude appeal from language to the zeal with which i shall embrace it the negotiations to which i am joined may perhaps be protracted beyond our present expectation in which case tho i know you must receive much better intelligence from the gentlemen whose residence there has brought them into a more intimate acquaintance with the characters  views of the european courts yet i shall certainly presume to add my mite should it only serve to convince you of the warmth of those sentiments of respect  esteem with which i have the honor to be your excys mo ob  mo hble servt thomas jefferson jan         baltimore james madison to james madison  m mss baltimore jan         dear sir —a gentleman returning from this place to philadelphia gives me an opportunity of sending you a line we reached newport the evening     of the day on which we left you there we were misled by an assurance that a lower ferry could not be crossed we therefore directed our course for the bald friars  thence to another ferry   miles above between these two we lost two days in the most execrable situation in point of accommodation  society which can be conceived in short braving all weather  plunging thro thick and thin we arrived here last night being the fifth from philadelphia—i saw monsr de villebrun last night  augur him to be agreeable enough i learnt not from him but others that to embark their sick c will keep us three days—having nothing particular to communicate i will give you an anecdote which possibly you may not have heard and which is related to me by major f ranks  who had it from doctor franklin himself i use the only cypher i can now get at using the marginal numbers in order  not as concerted mr z  while at paris had often pressed the dr to communicate to him his several negotiations with the ct of france wch the dr avoided as decently as he could at length he received from mr z a very intemperate letter he folded it up and put it into a pigeon hole a  d  d  so on to a fifth or sixth he recd  disposed of in the same way finding no answer could be obtained by letter mr z paid him a personal visit  gave a     loose to all the warmth of which he is susceptible the dr replied i can no more answer this conversation than the several impatient letters you have written me taking them down from the pigeon hole call on me when you are cool  good humored  i will justify myself to you they never saw each other afterwards as i find no a in the book erase the b in the first a b so that    may denote a instead of a b i met here the enclosed paper which be so good as to return with my compliments to miss kitty i apprehend she had not got a copy of it and i retain it in my memory be pleased to present me very affectionately to the ladies  gentlemen whose pleasing society i lately had at mrs houses and believe me your assured friend thomas jefferson feb 0       baltimore james madison to james madison  m mss baltimore   february      dear sir —i write by this post to the minister of foreign affairs but will repeat to you the facts mentioned to him  some others improper for a public letter  some reflections on them which can only be hazarded to the ear of friendship the cold weather having set in the evening of the  0th ult being the same in which i arrived here the chevalr de villebrun was obliged to fall down with his ship  the guadeloupe to about twelve miles below this  the ice has since cut off all correspondence with him till yesterday when i got a boat and attempted a     passage there having passed a small boat before us we got about half way with tolerable ease but the influx of the tide then happening the ice closed on us on every side  became impenetrable to our little vessel so that we could get neither backwards nor forwards we were finally relieved from this situation by a sloop which forced its way down  put us on board the romulus where we were obliged to remain all night the chevalr de villebrun communicated to me several letters of intelligence which deserves weight by which we are informed that the enemy having no other employment at new york have made our little fleet their sole object for some time and have now cruizing for us nothing less than   ship of    guns    0    0      frigates from    to  0 guns a most amazing force for such an object the merchants who intended to have sent their vessels out with us have so far declined it that two vessels only go with us but they are unfortunately the greatest sluggards in the world the minister has given villebrun leave to remain if he thinks it expedient till the m of mch but politely and kindly offered the guadeloupe for my passage if i chose to run the risk i find that having laid ten months under water she got perfectly sobbed insomuch that she sweats almost continually on the inside in consequence of which her commander and several of the crew are now laid up with rheumatisms but this i should have disregarded had it not appeared that it was giving to the enemy     the ship  crew of a friend  delaying myself in fact by endeavoring at too much haste i therefore have not made use of the liberty given me by the minister villebrun seems certain he shall not sail on the first of march and i confess to you i see no reason to suppose that when that time arrives the same causes will not place our departure as distant as it now seems what then is to be done i will mention the several propositions which occur with some reflections on each   to go to boston  embark thence would to god i had done this at first i might now have been halfway across the ocean but it seems very late to undertake a journey of such length thro such roads  such weather  when i should get there some delay would still necessarily intervene—yet i am ready to undertake it if this shall be thought best   to stay here with patience till our enemies shall think proper to clear our coast there is no certain termination to this object it may not be till the end of the war   to fall down to york or hampton  there wait those favorable circumstances of winds  storms which the winter season sometimes presents this would be speedier than the  d but perhaps it may not be approved of by the commander for reasons which may be good tho unknown to me should this however be adopted we ought to be furnished by the marine department with or authorised to employ one or more swift sailing boats to go out of the capes occasionally  bring us intelligence to york or hampton wherever we should be   0   to ask a flag for me from the enemy  charter a vessel here this would be both quickest  most certain but perhaps it may be thought injurious to the dignity of the states or perhaps be thought such a favour as congress might not chuse to expose themselves to the refusal of with respect to the last nothing can be said as to the first i suppose were history sought many precedents might be found where one of the belligerent powers has received from the other passports for their plenipotentiaries  i suppose that fitzgerald  oswald got to paris now under protection of a flag  passport however these are tender points  i would not wish the sensibility of congress to be tried on my account if it would be probably disagreeable   to await a truce this cannot take place till after preliminaries are signed if then  tho these are not definitive yet it must be evident that new instructions  new or perhaps inconsistent matter would be introduced with difficulty  discredit there is an idle report here of peace being actually concluded this comes by the way of the w indies and must probably be founded on the settlement of preliminaries if it has any foundation at all should you think that the interference of congress might expedite my departure in any of the above ways or any other i have suggested these hasty reflections in hopes that you would do in it whatever you think right i shall acquiesce in anything  if nothing further comes to me i shall endeavor to push the third proposition with the commander  if i fail in that shall pursue the  d i wish to hear from     you as often as you have anything new i fear i shall be here long enough to receive many letters from you my situation is not an agreeable one and the less so as i contrast it with the more pleasing one i left so unnecessarily be so good as to present my esteem to the good ladies  gentlemen of your fireside  to accept yourself the warmest assurances of friendship from dr sir your friend  servt feb   the preceding was written the last night before i close my letter i will ask the favor of you to write me by the return of post and to let me have your own sentiments whether anything be or be not determined authoritatively which will have great weight with me i confess that after another nights reflection the  th is the plan which appears to me best on the whole and that the demand from new york is nothing more than what is made at the close of almost every war where the one or the other power must have a passport it is no more than asking a flag to new york should this however be disapproved the  d seems the only remaining plan which promises any degree of expedition perhaps the minister may have a repugnance to venture the romulus at york or hampton in which case if i could receive his approbation i should be willing to fall down there with the guadeloupe alone  be in readiness to avail ourselves of a northwesterly snow storm or other favorable circumstance     thomas jefferson feb        baltimore chevalier de la luzerne to the french minister chevalier de la luzerne j mss baltimore feb        sir —the chevalier de villebrun was so kind as to communicate to me yesterday your excys lre to him of jan together with the intelligence therein referred to i feel myself bound to return you my thanks for your orders to the guadeloupe frigate to receive me if i should think a passage should be hazarded under present circumstances according to this information which is the most worthy of credit of any we have received here it would seem that our capture would be unavoidable were we to go out now this therefore is a risk to which i cannot think of exposing his majestys vessel  subjects however i might be disposed to encounter personal hazards from my anxiety to execute with all the promptitude in my power a service which has been assigned to me i shall therefore wait with patience the arrival of the moment when the chevalr de villebrun shall be of opinion that the one or the other of the vessels may venture out without any greater risk than he shall think proportioned to her proper object independantly of mine it has been suggested to me this evening that perhaps their safe departure might be greatly forwarded by their falling down to york or hampton there to be ready at a moments warning to avail themselves of those favorable circumstances which the present season sometimes offers but of this yourself will be the proper judge i cannot close my lre without expressing to you my obligations to the chevalr de     villebrun for the particular attention he has shown to my accommodation on board his ship the apartments he has had constructed for me are ample  commodious  his politeness  merit as an officer are an agreeable presage of everything that shall depend on him i have delivered to him the two large packets you were pleased to put into my hands  he will dispose of them accordg to your orders i have the honr to be with the highest sentiments of esteem yr excys mo obedt  mo hble servt thomas jefferson feb        baltimore robert r livingston to the secretary for foreign affairs robert r livingston j mss baltimore feb        sir —i arrived here on the  0th of the last month  had a short interview the same evening with the chevalr de villebrun commander of the romulus there appeared at that time little apprehension but that we might sail in a few days but we were not very particular in our conference as we expected so soon to see each other again the severity of the cold however which commenced that night obliged the chevalr de villebrun to fall    miles below this place  excluded all correspondence with him till yesterday when i found means to get through the ice on board his ship he then communicated to me by direction of his excy the minister of france intelligence as to the number  force of the cruisers now actually watching the capes of the chesapeake i must acknolege that these appear such as to render     a capture certain were we to hazard it the minister was pleased at the same time to submit the guadeloupe to my wishes if i chose to adventure i take the liberty of troubling you with a copy of my letter to him on that subject i should certainly be disposed to run very considerable risks myself to effect my passage but i should think it an unfortunate introduction to an ally who has already done so much for us were i to add to his losses  disbursements that of a valuable ship  crew i wish that the present delay offered some period less distant than the lassitude of an avaricious enemy to watch for prey perhaps you may be able to put me in some more expeditious mode of passage than the one under which i am acquiescing at present i shall be much pleased to adopt any such which may come recommended from you without regard to personal risk or trouble in the meantime any intelligence which you can collect  will be pleased to give me as to the state of our coast will be of utility in determining whether  when we shall depart hence      thomas jefferson feb         baltimore robert r livingston to the secretary of foreign affairs robert r livingston j mss baltimore feb         sir —i apprised you in my former letter of the causes which had so long delayed my departure these still continue i have this moment received a printed copy of his brit majtys speech to his parliamt by which we learn that preliminaries between america  gr br among which is one for the acknowlegment of our independency have been provisionally agreed to on his part that the negotiations with the other powers at war were considerably advanced  that he hoped in a very short time they would end in terms of pacification as considerable progress has been made in the negotiations for peace since the appointment with which congress were pleased to honour me it may have become doubtful whether any communications i could make or any assistance i could yield to the very able gentleman in whose hands the business already is would compensate the expense of prosecuting my voyage to europe i therefore beg leave through you sir to assure congress that i desire this question to be as open to them now as it was on the day of my appointment and that i have not a wish of my own either to go or to stay they will be pleased to weigh the economy of the one measure against the chance which the other may offer of my arriving in such time as that any communications which have been confided to me may produce effect on definitive articles i shall continue here for the prosecution of my voyage under the orders before received or for     its discontinuance should that be more eligible to congress and be signified at any moment for my departure  thomas jefferson feb         baltimore james madison to james madison  madmss baltimore feb         dear sir —yours of the   th came to hand last night from what you mention in your letter i suppose the newspapers must be wrong when they say that mr adams had taken up his abode with dr f— i am nearly at a loss to judge how he will act in the negon he has f— he has jay he has the french he has the english to whom will he adhere his vanity is a lineament in his character which had entirely escaped me his want of taste i had observed notwithstanding all this he has a sound head on substantial points and i think he has integrity i am glad therefore that he is of the commission  expect he will be useful in it his dislike of all parties and all men by balancing his prejudices may give them some fair play to his reason as would a general benevolence of     temper at any rate honesty may be extracted even from poisonous weeds my stay here has given me opportunities of making some experiments on my amanuensis f—s perhaps better than i may have in france he appears to have a good eno heart and understanding somewhat better than common but too little guard over his lips i have marked him particularly in the company of women where he loses all power over himself and becomes almost lacking his temperature would not be proof against their allurements were such to be employed as engines against him this is in some measure the vice of his age but it seems to be increased also by his peculiar constitution i wrote to the chevalier de villebrun proposing his falling down to york or hampton which was one of the measures i suggested in my letter to you  was the most eligible except that of the flag in my own opinion his answer dated feb    is in these words je serois bien de lavis proposé a votre excellence daller mouiller a york ou hampton pour etre a portee de profiter des premiers vents de nord ouest qui me mettroient loin de la côte dans la nuit surtout si je navois pas de convoy a conserver mais des batiments entrés aujourdhui raportent avoir été chassés par quatre fregates pis que sur la cap charles et avoir vu au mouillage de linhaven un vaisseau et un fregate qui ont appareillés et pris un brig qui navigoit avec eux de plus york et hampton nont aps un canon monté si lennemi tres superieur entreprenoit de venir nous y forcer il y auroit peu de sureté     peutetre conviendroitil autant dattendre comme le propose m de la luzerne jusquau mois prochain des nouvelles de europe ou larrivée dune division des antilles promise par m de vaudreuil ou bien encore que l ennemi fatigué ne fut obligé de rentrer a new york the last is       and furnishes matter for doubt how far the departure of the romulus is a decided measure it seems not   0 ing     tion so for a purpose wherein time is the most pressing circumstance the idea of getting in her is to be abandoned to go to boston would be the most œconomical plan but it would be five weeks from my leaving this place before i could expect to sail from thence of course i may from here be in france by the time i should be sailing from boston five weeks in a crisis of negotiation may be much should i accept of the guadaloupe and she should be lost it would under present circumstance draw censure moreover in this or the former case besides losing the vessel what will be my situation that of a prisoner certainly from what has been done in laurens case they would not release me in expectation of a high exchange or if they did it would only be on parole in which case i could neither act nor communicate this plan would have in its favour œconomy and a possibility a bare one of despatch that of the flag still appears best it is favoured by the circumstances of despatch safety  the preservation of our papers but when i think of the expence i feel myself annihilated in comparison with it a vessel may be got here but i question if for less than          or     0       pounds     besides can a passport be obtained from new york without naming the vessel the crew c if not it would take long to furnish these circumstances from hence the delaware would be more eligible in that case otherwise this place is if this should be adopted what would be the extent of the protection of the flag to the papers i should carry these so far as this question would affect them would be of three descriptions   my own commission instructions  other documents relative to my mission   public letters to the consuls ministers  others on other business   private letters i have no means of satisfying myself on these points here if therefore this measure should be adopted i should thank you for your opinion on them as you can where you are doubtful make enquiry of others i am exceedingly fatigued with this place as indeed i should with any other where i had neither occupation nor amusement i am very particularly indebted here to the politeness  hospitality of genl la vallette who obliges me to take refuge in his quarters from the tedium of my own the latter half of every day you are indebted to him too as i should make my long letters much longer  plague you with more cypher were i confined at home all day i beg you to be assured of my warmest wishes for your happiness feb      oclock pm after sealing up this letter i received yours of yesterday inclosing the kings speech for which i thank you much the essential information conveyed to us by that is that the preliminary for our independance which we before   0 knew to have been agreed between the plenipos has been provisionally ratified by him i have thought it my duty to write the enclosed letter which after reading you will be so good as to stick a wafer in  deliver i wish no supposed inclination of mine to stand in the way of a free change of measure if congress should think the public interest required it the argument of œconomy is much strengthened by the impossibility now certain of going but in an express vessel the principal matters confided to me were   the new instruction which perhaps may have been sent by count rochambeau or may yet be sent   the details of the financiers department which mr morris not chusing to trust to paper had communicated verbally these in the event of peace or truce may safely go in paper   the topics which support our right to the fisheries to the western country  the navigation of the mississippi the first of these is probably settled the two latter should only come into discussion in the spanish negociation and therefore would only have been the subject of private conversation with mr jay whose good sense  knowledge of the subject will hardly need any suggestions i forgot to mention to you in my letter that mr nash arrived here the day before yesterday on his way to n carolina and that mr brunt is not yet arrived but is weekly expected i am yours affectionately     thomas jefferson march        philadelphia francis eppes to francis eppes  philadelphia march        dear sir —in my last from baltimore i informed you that my voyage to europe was at least suspended till further intelligence should be received i returned to this place about four or five days ago that i might be on the spot to act as shall be ultimately concluded by congress though nothing since has come to us we consider the event of peace as certain and speedy the hearing nothing is a proof of this the french minister the british at new york and congress are equally uninformed this would not have been the case had the conferences for peace broken off as has been pretended or had they become languid the packets and dispatch vessels are detained doubtless on a daily expectation of sending something more definite than the signing of preliminaries capt barney is lying at lorient with the washington a dispatch vessel of congress ready to bring the advices from our plenipotentiaries from these circumstances you will judge that i expect every hour to receive permission to return home i shall be here but a very few days after this shall be received and expect to be myself the bearer of the first intelligence to you there is nothing new here i hope by the next post to receive a letter from you though after near three months absence without having ever heard a word of my dear little ones i shall receive your letter with fear and trembling lest any accident should have happened this dread i hope will be     removed patsy is well i hope mrs eppes has recovered better health if my prayers would be a medicine she should have them with more fervor than they were ever offered for myself present my love to her and the little ones and whenever you have an opportunity be so good as to let mr and mrs skipwith know that i remember them with affection i am dear sir your sincere friend thomas jefferson mar         pha robert r livingston to the secretary for foreign affairs robert r livingston j mss pha mar         sir —supposing the despatches received by the washington may have enabled congress to decide on the expediency of continuing or of countermanding my mission to europe i take the liberty of expressing to you the

in paris but the uncommon vigilance of the enemys cruisers immediately after the departure of the fr fleet deterrd every vessel from attemptg to go out the arrival of the preliminaries soon after shewed the impropriety of my proceeding and i am just now setting out on my return to virga i cannot however take my departure without paying to yourself  your worthy colleagues my homage for the good work you have completed for us and congratulating you on the singular happiness of having borne so distinguished a part both in the earliest  latest transactions of this revolution the terms obtained for us are indeed great and are so deemed by your country a few illdesigning debtors excepted i am in hopes you will continue at some one of the european courts most agreeable to yourself that we may still have the benefit of your talents i took the liberty in my letter of suggesting a wish that you would be so kind as to engage lodgings for me should you have given yourself this trouble i beg leave to return you my thanks and to ask the favor of you to communicate the amount of their hire to mr rob morris of this city who will immediately remit it to you as i lodge money in his hands for this purpose accept my warmest wishes for your happiness and be assured of the sincerity with which i have the honor to be dr sir your mo ob  mo hble servt p s i beg to be affly remembd to dr f  mr a

alteration which took place in the report on the impost c after i left you the article which bound the whole together was i fear essential to get the whole passed as that which proposed the conversion of state into federal debts was one palatable ingredient at least in the pill we were to swallow this proposition being then hopeful i never consulted you whether the paiment of our western expenditures annexed as a condition to our passing the articles recommended would not be acceded to by congress more especially when one of those articles is the cession of that very territory for the acquisition  defense of which these expenditures have been incurred if i recollect rightly congress offered this in their first proposition for a cession i beg your sentiments however on this subject by return of the first post notwithstanding the unpromising form of these articles i have waited a fortnight in the neighborhood of richmond that i might see some of the members i passed yesterday in associating  conversing with as many of them as i could the attorney has cooperated in this work this is the view i form at present of the leaders dr arthur lee r h lee mr page taylor will be against them so will thruston  white if     elected and even an a compbell is thought worthy of being named with these as having some influence in the s western quarter in their favour will be tyler tazewell genl nelson w nelson nicholas  a mr archibald stewart a young man of good talents from the westward henry as usual is involved in mystery should the popular tide run strongly in either direction he will fall in with it should it not he will have a struggle between his enmity to the lees  his enmity to everything which may give influence to congress t homson mason is a meteor whose path cannot be calculated all the powers of his mind seem at present to be concentrated in one single object the producing a convention to new model the state constitution this is a subject much agitated and seems the only one they will have to amuse themselves with till they shall receive your propositions these should be hastened as i think the session will be short i have seen mr wythe he has none of his amendments or notes on the confederation mr short has desired me to suggest his name as that of a person willing to become a legatine secretary should these offices be continued i have apprised him of the possibility that they may not you know my high opinion of his abilities  merits i will therefore only add that a peculiar talent for prying into facts seems to mark his character as proper for such a business he is young  little experienced in business tho well prepared for it these defects will lessen daily should persons be proposed less proper on the whole you would     on motives of public good knowing his willingness to serve give him a nomination  do justice to his character i rejoice at the information that                    yourself concur in sentiments i rejoice as it will render you happier and give to me a neighbor on whom i shall set high value you will be continued in your delegation till the end of three years from the completion of the confederation you will therefore model your measures accordingly you say nothing of the time when you shall pay your visit to virginia i hope you will let me know of your arrival as soon as it happens should the call be made on me which was sometimes the subject of our conversation and be so timed with your visit as that you may be the bearer of it i shall with great pleasure accommodate my movements to yours so as

has letters for me to post tho i have not     yet received them i hear but little from our assembly mr henry has declared in favour of the impost this will ensure it how he is as to the other questions of importance i do not learn on opening my papers when i came home i found among them the enclosed cyphers which i had received from either mr morriss or mr livingstons office will you be so good as to return them for me the confusion into which my papers had got going to  from baltimore  left there for some time will i hope apologize for my having overlooked them when i returned the other papers i send you inclosed the debates in congress on the subjects of independance voting in congress  the quotas of money to be required from the states i found on looking that i had taken no

commonwealth in convention assembled send greeting it is known to you and to the world that the government of great britain with which the american states were not long since connected assumed over them an authority unwarrantable and oppressive that they endeavored to enforce this authority by arms and that the states of new hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut new york new jersey pennsylvania delaware maryland virginia north carolina south carolina and georgia considering resistance with all its train of horrors as a lesser evil than abject submission closed in the appeal to arms it hath pleased the sovereign disposer of all human events to give to this appeal an issue favorable to the     rights of the states to enable them to reject forever all dependence on a government which had shown itself so capable of abusing the trusts reposed in it and to obtain from that government a solemn and explicit acknowledgment that they are free sovereign and independent states during the progress of that war through which we had to labor for the establishment of our rights the legislature of the commonwealth of virginia found it necessary to make a temporary organization of government for preventing anarchy and pointing our efforts to the two important objects of war against our invaders and peace and happiness among ourselves but this like all other acts of legislation being subject to change by subsequent legislatures possessing equal powers with themselves it has been thought expedient that it should receive those amendments which time and trial have suggested and be rendered permanent by a power superior to that of the ordinary legislature the general assembly therefore of this state recommended it to the good people thereof to choose delegates to meet in general convention with powers to form a constitution of government for them and to declare those fundamentals to which all our laws present and future shall be subordinate and in compliance with this recommendation they have thought proper to make choice of us and to vest us with powers for this purpose we therefore the delegates chosen by the said good people of this state for the purpose aforesaid and now assembled in general convention do in   0 execution of the authority with which we are invested establish the following constitution and fundamentals of government for the said state of virginia the said state shall forever hereafter be governed as a commonwealth the powers of government shall be divided into three distinct departments each of them to be confided to a separate body of magistracy to wit those which are legislative to one those which are judiciary to another and those which are executive to another no person or collection of persons being of one of these departments shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others except in the instances hereinafter expressly permitted the legislature shall consist of two branches the one to be called the house of delegates the other the senate and both together the general assembly the concurrence of both of these expressed on three several readings shall be necessary to the passage of a law delegates for the general assembly shall be chosen on the last monday of november in every year but if an election cannot be concluded on that day it may be adjourned from day to day till it can be concluded the number of delegates which each county may send shall be in proportion to the number of its qualified electors and the whole number of delegates for the state shall be so proportioned to the whole number of qualified electors in it that they     shall never exceed three hundred nor be fewer than one hundred whenever such excess or deficiency shall take place the house of delegates so deficient or excessive shall notwithstanding this continue in being during its legal term but they shall during that term readjust the proportion so as to bring their number within the limits before mentioned at the ensuing election if any county be reduced in its qualified electors below the number authorized to send one delegate let it be annexed to some adjoining county for the election of senators let the several counties be allotted by the senate from time to time into such and so many districts as they shall find best and let each county at the time of electing its delegates choose senatorial electors qualified as themselves are and four in number for each delegate their county is entitled to send who shall convene and conduct themselves in such manner as the legislature shall direct with the senatorial electors from the other counties of their district and then choose by ballot one senator for every six delegates which their district is entitled to choose let the senatorial districts be divided into two classes and let the members elected for one of them be dissolved at the first ensuing general election of delegates the other at the next and so on alternately forever all free male citizens of full age and sane mind who for one year before shall have been resident in the county or shall through the whole of that time have possessed therein real property of the     value of — or shall for the same time have been enrolled in the militia and no others shall have a right to vote for delegates for the said county and for senatorial electors for the district they shall give their votes personally and viva voce the general assembly shall meet at the place to which the last adjournment was on the fortysecond day after the day of election of delegates and thenceforward at any other time or place on their own adjournment till their office expires which shall be on the day preceding that appointed for the meeting of the next general assembly but if they shall at any time adjourn for more than one year it shall be as if they had adjourned for one year precisely neither house without the concurrence of the other shall adjourn for more than one week nor to any other place than the one at which they are sitting the governor shall also have power with the advice of the council of state to call them at any other time to the same place or to a different one if that shall have become since the last adjournment dangerous from an enemy or from infection a majority of either house shall be a quorum and shall be requisite for doing business but any smaller proportion which from time to time shall be thought expedient by the respective houses shall be sufficient to call for and to punish their nonattending members and to adjourn themselves for any time not exceeding one week the members during their attendance on the general assembly and for so long a time before and after as shall be necessary for travelling to and     from the same shall be privileged from all personal restraint and assault and shall have no other privilege whatsoever they shall receive during the same time daily wages in gold

respective house the general assembly shall not have power to infringe this constitution to abridge the civil rights of any person on account of his religious belief to restrain him from professing and supporting that belief or to compel him to contributions other than those he shall have personally stipulated for the support of that or any other to ordain death for any crime but treason or murder or military offences to pardon or give a power of pardoning persons duly convicted of treason or felony but instead thereof they may substitute one or two new trials and no more to pass laws

this state or any other state or power whatsoever by executive powers we mean no reference to those powers exercised under our former government by the crown as of its prerogative nor that these shall be the standard of what may or may not be deemed the rightful powers of the governor we give them those powers only which are necessary to execute the laws and administer the government and which are not in their nature either legislative or judiciary the application of this idea must be left to reason we do however expressly deny him the prerogative powers of erecting courts offices boroughs corporations fairs markets ports beacons lighthouses and seamarks of laying embargoes of establishing precedence of retaining within the state or recalling to it any citizen thereof and of making denizens except so far as he may be authorized from time to time by the legislature to exercise any of those     powers the power of declaring war and concluding peace of contracting alliances of

june         dear sir —your favours of the   th   0th ult came to hand about a week ago i am informed the assembly determined against the capacity of reelection in those gentlemen of the delegation who could not serve a complete year i do not know on what this decision could be founded my hopes of the success of the congressional propositions here have lessened exceedingly mr henry had declared in favor of the impost but when the question came on he was utterly silent i understand it will certainly be lost if it be not already instead of ceding more lands to the u s a proposition is made to revoke the former cession     mr henry is for bounding our state reasonably enough but instead of ceding the parts lopped off he is for laying them off into small republics what further his plan is i do not hear however you get the parliamentary news so much more directly from richmond that it is idle for me to give it you from hence a convention for the amendment of our constitution having been much the topic of conversation for some time i have turned my thoughts to the amendments necessary the result i enclose to you you will have opportunities during your stay in philadelphia of enquiring into the success of some of the parts of it which tho new to us have been tried in other states i shall only except against your communicating it to any one of my own country as i have found prejudices frequently produced against propositions handed to the world without explanation or support i trust that you will either now or in some future situation turn your attention to this subject in time to give your aid when it shall be finally discussed the paper inclosed may serve as a basis for your amendment or may suggest amendments to a better groundwork i further learn that the assembly are excluding members of congress from among them whether the information they may derive from their presence or their being marked by the confidence of the people is the cause of this exclusion i cannot tell be pleased to present me with affection to my acquaintances of the house  to receive yourself     the sincerest assurances of the esteem with which i am dr sir your friend  servt p s i will take the first opportunity of forwarding the pamphlet to your father thomas jefferson july         monticello benjamin harrison to the governor of virginia benjamin harrison v s a monticello july   —     sir —i am sorry you have been at the trouble of sending an express to me for information as to the transactions between the executive and nathan as i am satisfied i do not recollect a single fact that you are not already possessed of in the winter of     –   0 mr baker presented us some bills drawn by genl clarke colo todd and perhaps others which he said he had taken up at new orleans or the havanna and paid a hard dollar for every one named in the bills at that time at that time i think we had been made to believe that depreciation had not reached kaskaskia and the bills appearing fair we considered them in the nature of many others taken up by pollock  wrote acceptances on the greatest part of them undertaking to pay them in toto at  ⅙ dollars the hundred i believe we restricted some of them perhaps as drawn by subordinate officers till we could write to genl clarke  colo todd we wrote to them and desired a description of the bills we were to pay fully  the rates of depreciation if depreciation had affected any they sent     us a description of the hard money bills to wit all drawn on new orleans and a table of depreciation of the others this shewed we had wrote acceptances for hard money on some bills thereon depreciation should have been allowed we laid the case before mr pendleton  wythe intending if they thought us bound by our erroneous acceptances that we would pay them they differed in opinion we then informed nathan of clarke  todds marks to distinguish the bills that this had proved we had accepted some in hard money on which depreciation should have been allowed told him it was a case in which every man in the state was interested that we did not wish to be judges in it ourselves nor to refer it to any persons within the state but we would refer it to lawyers in philadelphia whither we knew he was going and therefore that it would be convenient for him to have it decided there as it would to us our delegates being on the spot to act for us he agreed to it i wrote a state of the case read it to him at the council board he agreed every article was right we enclosed it to our delegates and is the last part of the transaction which happened within my knowledge our delegates have told me since that he tergivisated a little there disputed facts declining the reference but that he had finally come to but of this they can give more certain information in every part of the transaction with us he acted candidly enough as far as we could see and we should certainly have thought ourselves bound to pay the money agreeable to the award   0 there was another transaction with him colo gibson i think it was came for clothing for the troops at fort pitt we were distressed how to procure them nathan offered to go with gibson to baltimore and buy them  to wait a considerable time for the money perhaps he might name a year or some such term we agreed he went bought them  drew on us immediately for the money which we did not like i am persuaded there is nothing above but which you know from more certain hands for indeed my recollection is too faint to be trusted even as to what i have said some parts i recollect positively enough others very faintly or perhaps steps in the place of memory i should really be afraid to affirm them positively if there be however any particular circumstances which you would wish to have sworn to i will endeavor to recollect them with more certainty and send them to you there is never a day scarcely but mr short colo moore and i buchanan can send me a letter  i can as spedily return an answer be pleased to present my compliments to mrs randolph and believe me to be with much affection dr sir your friend  servt thomas jefferson aug         monticello james madison to james madison mad mss monticello aug         dear sir —your favor of july    which came to hand long ago remains still unacknowledged as from the time of its receipt i had constant hopes     that you would be on the road for virginia before an answer could reach you that of the   th inst i received yesterday and leaves the time of your visit as unfixed as ever and excites some fear that i shall miss of you i propose to set out for congress about the middle of october unless they should be returned to philadelphia in which case i shall take at home the week i meant otherwise to pass at philadelphia on my way to congress i wish it would have been possible for your journey to have been so timed as that your return could have been when i go for i still suppose you mean to pass the winter there as you told me at a time when it seemed to have no object but that of prosecuting your studies more at leisure i sincerely lament the misadventure which has happened  from whatever cause it may have happened should it be final however the world still presents the same and many other resources of happiness and you possess many within yourself firmness of mind  unintermitting occupation will not long leave you in pain no event has been more contrary to my expectations and these were founded on what i thought a good knowledge of the ground but of all machines ours is the most complicated  inexplicable—either here or in philadelphia i must ask a perusal of your congressional notes with leave to take notes from them as they will better than any thing else possess me of the business i am to enter on what is become of the mutineers what     of the secretaryship of foreign affairs what of the commercial treaty with gr britain these and many other questions i hope for the pleasure of having answered by you at monticello be so good as to present my compliments to mrs house and mrs trist and to ask whether the pleasure of lodging in their house may be counted among the circumstances which will render philadelphia agreeable to me in case of the return of congress thither should congress not return thither would it be possible for you to engage me a tolerable berth wherever they are a room to myself if it be but a barrack is indispensable in either event of my being or not being in philadelphia i propose to place patsy there and will ask the favor of mrs trist to think for me on that subject and to advise me as to the person with whom she may be trusted some boarding school of course tho i am not without objections to her passing more than the day in such a one—the want of public occurrences worth detailing has filled my letter you find with private  unimportant subjects i wish you every possible felicity and am with sincere esteem dr sir your friend  servt thomas jefferson oct         eppington charles carter to charles carter eppington oct         dear sir —finding that mr eppes has made no purchase of horses for me the bearer comes for those you were so kind as to offer me thinking it almost certain that they will suit me from what i     hear of them i send you enclosed an order on mr donald for £ 0 which will be paid at sight only be so good as to keep it up till tuesday evening because if contrary to my expectations the horses should not suit they shall be returned to you by that time if you have a third horse matching them in all respects and of the same age price  qualities i will take him also for as i shall go on to the northward with a pair of horses in my phaeton it will be a great relief that the horse on which my servant shall ride may be changed with them occasionally—one word more my dear sir which is to express my uneasiness at your having supposed i imputed to you a motive in the change of price which never entered my head i could not think you wanted to take advantage of any necessity of mine because no such necessity existed i shall not use the horses i purchase till the month of march consequently i could not be under the spur of necessity till then besides this i knew you too well to have thought it under any circumstances i am with sentiments of sincere attachment  respect dear sir your most obedt humble servt ps—if you send me a third horse i will send an order for paiment of the price either to yourself or mr donald according as the first conveiance may offer to the one or the other     thomas jefferson nov         philadelphia benjamin harrison to the governor of virginia  benjamin harrison philadelphia nov         sir —your excellencys letter of the   th ult on the determination of congress as to their future residence has been duly received you would doubtless soon after have heard of their subsequent determination on the same subject as all this had taken place before my arrival i can give you an account only from the information of others congress it seems thought it best to generalize their first determination by putting questions on the several rivers on which it had been proposed that they should fix their residence hudson river the delaware  potomac were accordingly offered to the vote the first obtained scarcely any voices the delaware obtained seven this of course put the potomac out of the way and the delaware being once determined on there was scarcely any difference of opinion as to the particular spot the falls met the approbation of all the states present except pennsylvania which was for germantown  delaware which was for wilmington as to the latter it appeared that she had been induced to vote for the delaware on the single idea of getting congress to wilmington and that being disappointed in this they would not wish them on that river at all but would prefer georgetown or any other place this being discovered the southern delegates at a subsequent day brought on a reconsideration     of the question and obtained a determination that congress should set one half of their time at georgetown and that til accommodations should be provided there annapolis should be substituted in its place this was considered by some as a compromise by others as only unhinging the first determination and leaving the whole matter open for discussion at some future day it was in fact a rally and making a drawn battle of what had at first appeared to be decided against us what will be its final decision can only be conjectured i take the following to be the disposition of the several states the four eastern states are for any place in preference to philadelphia the more northern it is however the more agreeable to them new york and new hampshire are for the falls of delaware pennsylvania is for germantown first and next for the falls of delaware it is to be noted that philadelphia had no attention as a permanent seat delaware is for wilmington but for georgetown in preference to the falls of delaware or any other situation which attract the trade of their river maryland is for annapolis and the smallest hope for this will sacrifice a certainty for georgetown virginia every place southward of potomac being disregarded by the states as every place north of the delaware saw it would be useless to consider her interests as to more southern positions the falls of potomac will probably therefore unite the wishes of the whole state if this fails annapolis and the     falls of delaware are then the candidates were the convenience of the delegates alone to be considered or the general convenience to government in their transaction of business with congress annapolis would be preferred without hesitation but those who respect commercial advantages more than the convenience of individuals will probably think that every position on the bay of chesapeak or any of its waters is to be dreaded by virginia as it may attract the trade of that bay and make us with respect to maryland what delaware state is to pennsylvania considering the residence of congress therefore as it may influence trade if we cannot obtain it on the potomac it seems to be our interest to bring it past all the waters of the chesapeak bay the three southern states are for the most southern situation it should be noted that n hampshire and georgia were absent on the decisions of these questions but considering their interests would be directly opposite it was thought their joint presence or absence would not change the result from the preceding state of the views of the several members of our union your excellency will be enabled to judge what will be the probable determination on any future revision of the present plan the establishment of new states will be friendly or adverse to georgetown according to their situation if a state be first laid off on the lakes it will add a vote to the northern scale if on the ohio it will add one to the southern i had the happiness of seeing genl washington the other day after a space of seven years he has more health in his countenance than     i ever saw in it before among other political conversations he entered earnestly into one respecting the western section of virginia and the late vote of congress accepting it he thinks the conditions annexed by virginia and not acceded to by congress altogether unimportant at least much less important than the consequences which would result from the states adhering to these conditions he thinks that a friendly and immediate settlement of this matter can alone give us that political happiness and quiet which we must all wish for and that besides other disagreeable consequences the land will be lost to both as a source of revenue by their settlement of adventurers on it who will never pay any thing it is now become evident that the nine states north of potomac have made up their minds on these

fine weather proved i fear a very unfortunate one i pitied your probable situation in the tempestuous season which immediately succeeded your departure it is now above a fortnight since we should have met and six states only appear we have some hopes of rhode island coming in today but when two more will be added seems as insusceptible of calculation as when the next earthquake will happen we have at length received the definitive treaty with a joint letter from all our commissioners not a tittle is changed in the treaty but the preamble  some small things which were of course the commissioners write that the riot of philadelphia  departure of congress thence made the most serious impressions in europe and have excited great doubts of the stability of our confederacy  in what we shall end the accounts were greatly exaggerated  it is suspected that gr br wished to sign no treaty you have seen george mason i hope  had much conversation with him what are his sentiments as to the amendment

gerry mr williamson dec      report of committee on unfinished business  c c december      the committee appointed to revise the files of reports and appointment of committees  to report what matters will require the attention of congress previous to an adjournment have revised the files of reports digested them under five heads and agreed to the following report thereon the first head comprehends important reports requiring the assent of   states these relate to the     ratification of the definitive treaty the military arrangements in time of peace the civil arrangements foreign and domestic the territories on our western border and the definition of the powers proper for a committee of the states which several matters are thought essential for the consideration of congress before their adjournment the second head comprehends reports which also require the assent of   states they relate to matters of account  particular claims for money which may probably be dispatched in those short intervals or portions of the day in which it may not be convenient to discuss the first great subjects many of them however are such as ought not to detain congress whenever they shall be ready for adjournment the third head comprehends reports which may be acted on by   states  which therefore may be taken up by congress immediately the fourth comprehends those which should be postponed to another session some of them being not at all pressing and others not yet matured for determination the fifth comprehends those reports which having been rendered useless by subsequent events may be postponed generally the committee having not had time yet to revise the appointment of committees and to arrange their objects under the same heads beg leave to report again when they shall have made further progress     thomas jefferson dec         report on definitive treaty  c c december         the committee to whom were referred the definitive treaty of peace between the united states of america and his britannic majesty and the joint letter from mr adams mr franklin and mr jay have agreed to the following report resolved that the said definitive treaty be ratified by the united states in congress assembled that a proclamation should be immediately issued notifying the said definitive treaty  ratification to the several states of the union  requiring their observance thereof that congress should immediately and earnestly recommend to the legislatures of the respective states to provide for the restitution of all estates rights  properties which have been confiscated belonging to real british subjects and also of the estates rights  properties of persons resident in districts which were in the possession of his britannic majestys arms at any time between the  0th day of november      and the   th day of jany       and who have not borne arms against the said united states and that persons of any other description shall have free liberty to go to any part or parts of any of the thirteen united states  therein to remain twelve months unmolested in their endeavors to obtain the restitution of such of their estates rights  properties as may have been     confiscated and that congress should also immediately  earnestly recommend to the several states a reconsideration  revision of all acts or laws regarding the premises so as to render the said laws or acts perfectly consistent not only with justice  equity but with that spirit of conciliation which on the return of the blessings of peace should universally prevail and that congress should also immediately  earnestly recommend to the several states that the estates rights  properties of such last mentioned persons should be restored to them they refunding to any persons who may be now in possession the bonâ fide price where any has been given which such persons may have paid on purchasing any of the said lands rights or properties since the confiscation thomas jefferson decemb         annapolis benjamin harrison to the governor of virginia  benjamin harrison annapolis decemb         sir —i had the honor of writing to your excellency on the   th instant on the subject of the definitive treaty on the day following we made up a congress of seven states but nine being requisite to ratify the treaty we have been unable to get this done and of course till it be ratified congress can make no communications on the subject to the states i am sorry to say that i see no immediate prospect of making up nine states so     careless are either the states or their delegates to their particular interests as well as the general good which would require that they be all constantly and fully represented in congress several letters from our foreign ministers have been read in the course of the past week a joint one accompanying the treaty informs us that they were proceeding in negotiations on the subject of commerce with mr hartley the british minister giving and receiving propositions when a vessel arrived in france from philadelphia bringing intelligence that all our ports were thrown open to british vessels mr hartley on this informed them he could take no other steps till he should communicate this intelligence to his court and receive their instructions he communicated it and from that moment they were locked up in impenetrable reserve and he unable to extort an answer of any kind from them while expecting this answer the ministers proceeded to exchange propositions for a definite pacification ours proposed a three years suspension of executions on judgments for british debts and that no interest should be allowed from the commencement of the war till the definitive signing that accounts should be taken of all wanton waste of property on both sides and confiscations and the balance be paid in money by the party suffering least that the st lawrence the water boundary between us  the mississippi with the carrying places on whatever side should be common to both but it was now become impossible to get an answer of any sort from the court     of london and when the regulations between the other belligerent powers were matured for signing mr hartley received orders to sign the preliminary articles as definitive which was done mr hartley who wished to establish a liberal system of commerce with us then went to london hoping to return shortly and renew the commercial discussions but our ministers think it doubtful whether he will return at all i take the liberty of enclosing you an extract from their letter expressing their sentiments on some subjects of importance supposing it will be neither unpleasant nor unprofitable to know how we are viewed on the general scale of nations i am sure it would be unnecessary even to hint to your excellency that no part of this extract should be permitted to fall into the indiscreet hands of any printer it seems possible that great britain may continue on the reserve till the present crisis in europe shall have taken its direction the two empires have formed an alliance defensive against all christian powers  offensive against the turks when announced by the empress to the k of prussia he answered that he was very sensible upon this communication as one is on the communication of things of great importance thus avoiding a declaration and reserving himself at liberty to take any side or no side the court of france took it up in a higher tone and expressed her astonishment at the objects of the alliance she immediately began the work of putting her army on the war establishment yet it is said there is a division in their councils the present     minister cannot retire from his declarations which are for opposing the dangerous accession of power to austria and prussia should they as they propose drive the turks out of europe  divide the territories they should abandon the continuance or removal of the present minister is suggested as an index of ultimate determination of france if he goes out they mean to be pacific  to be active if he is retained yet it is doubted whether france can venture into the war without the aid of prussia great britain it is suspected will lie dormant to avail herself of the distresses of her neighbor happy for us that we have got into port just as the storm is rising propositions for treaties of commerce have come to dr franklin from several european courts and others are ready to treat denmark portugal sardinia the emperor of morocco have made overtures the last is so well disposed that he has issued orders to his armed vessels to molest no american and has sent a person to paris to attend any person delegated from us to his court great britain will send no minister to america till she receives one from thence the emperor of germany cannot from the action of his court our minister mr dana is on the return from petersburg nothing being done there tho probably their dispositions were become favorable at the time it was thought necessary by his recall to show we should no longer be suppliants anywhere it is to be noted that the observation of our ministers in the enclosed extract that the present aspect of our affairs has somewhat abated the ardor of the     european nations to form connections with us is posterior in time to the state given above i recollect nothing important enough to be added to this sketch of our affairs in europe  those of europe itself the former method of correspondence by joint letters from the delegates to the executive has been liable to some difficulties the same object does not always make the same impression on different eyes of consequence it might happen that by pursuing the method of joint representation much must be kept back because all had not formed the same idea of it being sensible that frequent and full communications are for the public good we have agreed to adopt the following plan of official correspondency with your excellency if it shall meet with your approbation resolutions of congress and other solemn things which call for authentic notification we will communicate jointly but all other matters which admit differences of opinion we propose shall be communicated weekly by some one gentleman of the delegation having previously shown his letter to his colleagues if they think he has omitted anything or represented it differently from their own view of it they reserve a private and separate right of writing to your excellency their separate sentiments in this way we think you will receive fuller information and that you may judge for yourself where you find a difference of opinion the duty of correspondence is made mine for the present month and will be taken up by my colleagues successively in the order of their examination each exercising it a month     thomas jefferson dec      resolutions relating to british treaty  c c dec      that the said ministers be instructed in their negociation with the erased court to urge with perseverance the necessity of a reasonable forbearance in the levy of debts due within these states to british subjects the establishment of the idea of these states that no interest during the war is due on these debts c all demands for interest accruing during the war would be highly inequitable  unjust the expediency of settling this by precise stipulation in order to avoid those mutual complaints  altercations which may disturb the harmony of the two nations that they require with firmness  decision full satisfaction for all slaves  other property belonging to citizens of these states taken and carried away in violation of the preliminary  definitive articles of peace to enable them to do this on precise grounds congress will furnish them with necessary facts  documents thomas jefferson mr gerry mr williamson dec  0      report on letters from the ministers in paris  december  0      the comee consisting of mr jefferson mr gerry and mr williamson to whom were referred the letters   0 of the ministers for the u s in europe have agreed to the following report they find that instructions bearing date the    of octr      were sent to the ministers plenipotentiary of the u s of america at the court of versailles empowered to negotiate a peace or to any one or more of them for concerting draughts or propositions for treaties of amity and commerce with the commercial powers of europe but that their powers will not extend to the actual signature of any such treaty nor to negotiate with any state or power out of europe they do not find that any commission consonant with these instructions has been issued to the said ministers they are of opinion it will be advantageous to these united states to conclude such treaties with russia the court of vienna germany prussia denmark the elector of saxony hamburg great britain spain portugal genoa tuscany rome naples venice sardinia and the ottoman porte for its possessions in europe and asia and africa that in the formation of these treaties the following points be carefully stipulated   that each party shall have a right to carry     their own produce manufactures and merchandize in their own bottoms to the ports of the other and thence to take the produce  merchandize of the other paying in both cases such duties only as are paid by the most favoured nation freely where it is freely granted to such nation on paying the compensation where such nation does the same   that with the nations holding territorial possessions in america a direct  similar intercourse be admitted between the u s  such possessions or if this cannot be obtained then a direct  similar intercourse between the u s  certain free ports within such possessions that if this neither can be obtained permission be stipulated taking from such possessions in their own bottoms the produce  merchandize thereof to those states directly and for these states to carry in their own bottoms their produce  merchandize to such possessions directly or as by a possession to the inhabitants of such possessions to carry their produce and merchandize in their own bottoms to the free ports of other nations and thence to take back directly the produce  merchandize of these states   that these u s being by their constitution consolidated into one federal republic they be considered in all such treaties  in every case arising under them as one nation upon the principles of the federal constitution   that it be proposed though not indispensably required that if war should hereafter arise between the two contracting parties the merchants of either country then residing in the other shall be allowed     to remain   months to collect their debts  settle their affairs  may depart freely  carrying off all their effects without molestation or hindrance  all fishermen all cultivators of the earth  all artizans or manufacturers unarmed  inhabiting unfortified towns villages or places who labour for the common subsistance  benefit of mankind  peaceably following their respective employments shall be allowed to continue the same  shall not be molested by the armed force of the enemy in whose power by the events of war they may happen to fall but if any thing is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such armed force the same shall be paid for at a reasonable price  all merchants  traders exchanging the products of different places  thereby rendering the necessaries  conveniences  comforts of human life more easy to obtain  more general shall be allowed to pass free  unmolested and neither of the contracting powers shall grant or issue any commission to any private armed vessel empowering them to take or destroy such trading ships or interrupt such commerce   and in case either of the contracting parties shall happen to be engaged in war with any other nation it is farther agreed in order to prevent all the difficulties and misunderstandings that usually arise respecting the merchandize heretofore called contraband such as arms ammunition  military stores of all kinds that no such articles carrying by the ships or subjects of one of the parties to the enemies of the other shall on any account be deemed contraband so as to induce confiscation  a loss of     property to individuals nevertheless it shall be lawful to stop such ships  detain them for such length of time as the captors may think necessary to prevent the inconvenience or damage that might ensue from their proceeding on their voyage paying however a reasonable compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the proprietors and it shall farther be allowed to use in the service of the captors the whole or any part of the military stores so detained paying the owners the full value of the same to be ascertained by the current price at the place of its destination but if the other contracting party will not consent to discontinue the confiscation of contraband goods then that it be stipulated that if the master of the vessel stopped will deliver out the goods charged to be contraband he shall be admitted to do it and the vessel shall not in that case be carried into any port but shall be allowed to proceed on her voyage   that in the same case where either of the contracting parties shall happen to be engaged in war with any other power all goods not contraband belonging to the subjects of that other power and shipped in the bottoms of the party hereto who is not engaged in the war shall be entirely free and that to ascertain what shall constitute the blockade of any place or port it shall be understood to be in such predicament when the assailing power shall have taken such a station as to expose to eminent danger any ship or ships that would attempt to sail in or out of the said port and that no vessel of the party who is not engaged in the said war shall     be stopped without a material  well grounded cause and in such cases justice shall be done and an indemnification given without loss of time to the persons aggrieved  thus stopped without sufficient cause   that no rights be stipulated for aliens to hold real estate property lands within these states this being utterly inadmissible by their several laws  policy but where on the death of any person holding real estate within the territory of one of the contracting parties such real estate would by their laws descend on a subject or citizen of the other were he not disqualified by alienage there he shall be allowed a reasonable time to qualify himself for holding it by the his country  allegiance to dispose of the same  withdraw the proceeds without molestation   and that such treaties be made for a limited to the term of not exceeding  0 years from the exchange of ratifications—   that these instructions be considered as supplementary to those of oct      and not as revoking except where they contradict them that our ministers be informed that such articles as may be disagreeable to the other party  are indifferent to us in point of interest remain not that they should insist on indispensably that where in treaty with a particular nation they can procure particular advantages to the specification of which we have been unable to descend our object in these instructions having been to form outlines only  general principles of treaty with many nations it is our     expectation they will procure them tho not pointed out in these instructions and where they may be able to form treaties on general principles which in their judgment will be more beneficial to the united states than those herein directed to be made their basis they are notwithstanding any thing precise or permitted to adopt such b against to such principles—that as to the duration of the treaties tho we have proposed to restrain them to the term of  0 years yet they are at liberty to extend the same as far as    years with any nation which may pertinaciously insist thereon and that it will be agreeable to us to have supplementary treaties with france the united netherlands  sweden which may bring the treaties we have entered into with them as nearly as may be to the principles of those now directed but that this be not pressed if the proposal should be found disagreeable that treaties of amity or of amity and commerce be entered into with morocco and the regencies of algiers tunis  tripoly and other states on the coast of barbary to continue for the same term of  0 years or for a term as much longer as can be procured that our ministers to be commissioned for treating with foreign nations make known to the emperor of morocco the great satisfaction which congress feel from the amicable disposition he has shown towards these states and his readiness to enter into alliance with them that the occupations of the war  distance of our situation have prevented our meeting his friendship so early as we wished but     that powers are now delegated to them for entering into treaty with him in the execution of which they are ready to proceed and that as to the expences of his minister they do therein what is for the honor  interest of the united states and conformable to the practice of other nations that a commission be issued to mr adams mr franklin and mr jefferson mr jay giving powers to them or the greater part of them to make and receive propositions for such treaties of amity and commerce and to negotiate and sign the same transmitting them to congress for their final ratification and that such commissions be in force for a term not exceeding two years that the said ministers be instructed in their negotiations with the mutilated court to urge with perseverance the necessity of a reasonable forbearance in the levy of debts due within these states to british subjects the establishment of the idea of these states that no interest during the war is due on these debts all demands for interest accruing during the war would be highly inequitable  unjust  on the expediency of settling this by precise stipulation in order to avoid these mutual complaints  altercations which may disturb the harmony of the two nations that the said ministers to be commissd for treaty with fr nations be referred to the instructions of the thirtieth day of may      relative to british debts the objects of which they are hereby directed to urge with perseverance that they require with firmness  decision full     satisfaction for all slaves  other property belonging to citizens of these states taken and carried away in violation of the preliminary  definitive articles of peace  to enable them to do this on precise grounds congress will furnish them with necessary facts  documents that the said ministers be instructed to notify to the powers with whom they may negotiate the great value at which these states will esteem their friendship and connection and that it will be their constant endeavour to promote a good understanding and harmony with them and to prevent everything which might interrupt it by every means in their power but that the heavy debt which they have contracted during the late war and the state of desolation and destitution in which many parts of these states were left in have has rendered it inconvenient at present for them to keep ministers resident at the courts of europe and they hope that this deviation from the practice of friendly nations may be ascribed to its true cause and not to any want of respect to their friends or of attachment to treaties to the faithful observance of which they shall at all times pay the most earnest attention that consuls be appointed for the ports of and consuls general established at that doct franklin be desired to notify to the apostolical nuncio at versailles that congress will always be pleased to testify their respect to his sovereign and state but that the subject of his application to doct franklin being purely spiritual it is without the jurisdiction and power of congress     who have no authority to permit or refuse it these powers being reserved to the several states individually that doct franklin be instructed to express to the court of france the constant desire of congress to meet their wishes that these states are about to form a general system of commerce by treaties with other nations  by interest negotiations that at this time we cannot foresee what claims might be given to those nations by the explanatory propositions from the count de vergennes on the      articles of our treaty of amity  commerce with his m le m but that he may be assured it will be our constant care to place no people on more advantageous ground than the subjects of his majesty that the papers containing the claim of the five forsters brothers for the prize of their vessel the three friends made by capt landais of the alliance frigate which papers were communicated by the count de vergennes to doct franklin to the end he might apply to congress for an indemnification of the said forsters be remitted to the said ministers with a copy of the fourth clause of the instructions to them of oct   th      and the following extract from doct franklins letter of july         to the secretary for foreign affairs viz mr barclay has in his hands the affair of the alliance and bon homme richard i will afford him all the assistance in my power but it is a very perplexed business that expedition though for particular reasons under american commissions  colours was carried on at the kings expense and under his orders m de chaumont     was the agent appointed by the minister of the marine to make the outfit he was also chosen by all the captains of the squadron as appears by an instrument under their hands to be their agent receive sell and divide prizes c the crown bought two of them at public sale and the money i understand is lodged in the hands of a responsible person at lorient m de chaumont says he has given in his accounts to the marine and that he has no more to do with the affair except to receive a ballance due to him that account however is i believe unsettled and the absence of some of the captains is said to make another difficulty which retards the completion of the business i never paid nor received any thing relating to that expedition nor had any other concern in it than barely ordering the alliance to join the squadron at m de sartines request—from which extract there is reason to believe the united states of america had no concern in the expedition but that it was carried on wholly under the authority and for the advantage of his most christian majesty that if this fact should not be so apparent as to give full satisfaction to his majestys ministers they then take such measures as in their discretion shall be thought most conducive to an amicable and equitable adjustment thereof on the best evidence they shall be able to procure that the claim of sr bayard against these united states for the sum of        dollars continental money is not founded in justice in the opinion of your committee from the circumstances of the case as stated by himself which are that a vessel and  00 cargo in which he was interested sailing in may      from charles town for france was taken by an english armed vessel and retaken by an american frigate called the boston that she was carried to boston and there sold as french property by mr de valnais consul for france at that port that he unfaithfully and irregularly as is suggested endeavoured to have the whole adjudged to the recaptors but that the sentence was that they were only entitled to one eighth and the sr bayards correspondents obliged mr de valnais to deposit with the consul of france in philadelphia        dollars continental money in part of the proceeds with a reserve to the sieur bayard against mr de valnais of every right of redress for his irregular conduct that no injurious intermeddling by the u s or any of them or by any of their citizens is here complained of that the money was constantly in the hands of the sieur bayards correspondents or of the consul for his nation that he may indeed have suffered by its depreciation as many others have suffered both foreigners and citizens but the latter in an infinite proportion to a much greater higher degree than the former that this depreciation was not effected by any arbitrary change by congress in the value or denomination of the money which yet has been frequently practised by european states who never have thought themselves bound to make good the losses thereby incurred either by their own citizens or by foreigners that ensued—against the will and the unremitting endeavours of congress that in this case too it might have been lessened if not prevented by investing it  0  the money immediately in gold  silver or in other commodities your comee therefore are of opinion that these states are not bound to make good the loss by depreciation and that the doing would bring on an infinitude of other cases with endless investigations and unfairness and would require greater funds than we are prepared with that as to the residue of the claims of the sr bayard if founded in truth and right they lie only against the state of georgia to the governor whereof it will be proper for congress to transmit copies of the papers expressing our confidence that that state will cause to be done in it what justice and the respect due between friendly nations require and that the sr bayard be referred to them that the friendly services rendered by the sr john baptist pequet agent for the french nation at lisbon to great numbers of american sailors carried prisoners into that port during the late war and his sufferings on that account merit the sincere acknowledgments of congress and that it be referred to the said ministers to deliver to him these in honorable terms and to make him such gratification as may indemnify his losses  properly reward his zeal thomas jefferson gerry mhenry dec         report on ceremonial for washington  cc december           the president and members

affords us nothing new for communication unless it be the affecting scene of yesterday genl washington then had his last audience of congress laid down his connection and bid a final adieu to them and to all public life his address on the occasion was worthy of him this you will see in the public papers i cannot help expressing my extreme anxiety at our present critical situation the departure of a member two days hence leaves us with only six states and of course stops all business we have no certain prospect of nine within a given time chance may bring them in and chance may keep them back in the meantime only a little over two months remain for their assembling ratifying  getting the ratification across the atlantic to paris all that can be said is that it is yet possible it is well known that great britain wished to postpone the conclusion of the treaty her reasons we know not but she certainly knew that a great continental war was kindling and that france our principal support would be probably deeply engaged in it it is not impossible then but she might hope for some favorable opportunity of changing the face of the treaty if the ratifications are not there by the day she will have too much ground for objection to the validity of the treaty and to ratify or not as she pleases as every  0  circumstance of distress will render her the easier on this point we are pleased with the intelligence of the day which is that she has actually landed twentyone regiments in ireland it comes by a ship from london to baltimore  from thence here but baltimore has not been famed for the truth of its intelligence thomas jefferson gerry ellery read hawkins dec         report on ratification of treaty  j mss december         resolved that however earnestly and anxiously congress wish to proceed to the ratification of the definitive treaty yet resolved that congress consisting at present of seven states only they are ought not to undertake that ratification of the definitive treaty without proper explanations   because the  th article of confederation takes from   because by the usage of modern nations it is now established them the power by declaring that congress shall that the ratification of a treaty by a sovereign power is the not enter into any treaty unless nine states assent essential act which gives it validity the signature  0  of the to the same ministers notwithstanding their plenipotentiary commission being understood as placing it according to the phrase of the writers on this subject subsparati only  as leaving to each sovereign an acknowledged right of rejection   because it would be a precedent replete with   because ratification being an act of so much energy and danger to these states as under that on future substance the authority to perform it is reserved to occasions seven states in opposition to six may nine states by those words in the ninth article of ratify treaties entered into by ministers in confederation which declare that congress shall not enter direct oppositions to their instructions though such instructions should have had the con into any treaty unless nine states assent currence of nine states to the same   because by the terms entering into a treaty the confederation must have intended that the assent of nine states should be necessary to the its completion as well as to the its commencement of a treaty its the object having been to guard the rights of the union in all those important cases wherein it has required the assent of nine states is required whereas by admitting the contrary construction seven states containing less than one third of the citizens of the union in opposition to  0  six containing more than two thirds may fasten on them a treaty commenced indeed under the co instru commission  instructions from nine states but concluded by the negotiators in express contradiction to such instructions and in direct sacrifice of their interests of so great a majority   because if   states be incompetent generally to the ratification of a treaty they are not made competent in this particular instance by the circumstances of the ratification of the provisional articles by nine states and in the instructions to our ministers to form a definitive one by them and their actual agreement in substance for either these circumstances are in themselves a ratification or are not if they are nothing further is requisite than to give attested copies of them in exchange for the british ratification if they are not then we remain where we were without a ratification of by   states and incompetent to ratify ourselves the next line is illegible but erased   because the seven states now present in congress saw this question in the same point of view only   days ago when by their unanimous resolution they declared that the assent of nine states was requisite to ratify this treaty and urged this as a reason to hasten forward the absent states   because such a ratification would be rejected by the other contracting party as null  unauthorized or if attested to them by the seal of the states without apprising them that it has been accredited expedited by order of seven states only it will be a breach of faith in us a prostitution of our seal  a  0  future ground when that circumstance shall become known of denying the validity of a ratification into which they shall have been so surprised   because there being still    days before the exchange of ratifications is requisite and states only wanting to render us competent we have the we may yet hope the presence of   states in time strongest presumptions that the measures taken by congress will bring them forward in time for ratification  for its passage across the atlantic and   because should we be disappointed in this hope the ratification will yet be placed on more honorable and defensible ground if made by   states as soon as so many shall be present and then sent for exchange urging in its support the small importance of an exchange of ratifications a few days sooner or later the actual impossibility of an earlier compliance and that failures produced by circumstances not under the controul of the parties  either in points so immaterial can never affect the validity of a treaty as to call for no compensation or in those which are material and admit of compensation can never affect the validity of the treaty itself thomas jefferson dec         annapolis benjamin harrison to the governor of virginia benjamin harrison v s a annapolis dec         sir —letters from holland from the middle to the last of september inform us that the citizens of the dutch state are all in commotion the conduct  0  of the prince of orange having been such as greatly to strengthen the republican party they are now pressing in the firmest tone a restoration of their constitutional rights friesland as usual leads the way they have demanded of the sovereign assembly of the states that the power of the stadtholder to change or reinforce the garrisons be limited or taken away and that themselves be authorized to exercise in arms for the defence of their country of  0000 men able to bear arms among them it is believed scarcely any will refuse to sign this demand the hollanders have referred to a committee in their last assembly the examination of the power by which the prince undertakes to appoint flag officers of their fleet and that he be desired to abstain from the exercise of it there happens to be vacant the place of admiral the other states seem to be in the same temper and are now regularly exercising themselves in arms under the ensigns of their respective towns tho each state is to chuse their stadtholder out of the orange family they consider themselves not bound to chuse the eldest and of course that they may chuse different ones the state of europe at present seems favorable to the republican party as the powers who might aid the prince are either fatigued with the late war or likely to be engaged in the ensuing one we have yet but seven states and no more certain prospects of nine than at any time heretofore we hope that the letters sent to the absent states will bring them forward  0  thomas jefferson jan        annapolis james madison to james madison mad mss annapolis jan        dear sir —your favour of the  0th dec came to hand about a fortnight after its date it has occasioned me to reflect a little more attentively on buffons central heat than i did in the moment of our conversation and to form an opinion different from what i then expressed the term central heat does of itself give us a false idea of buffons hypothesis if it means a heat lodged in the center of the earth and diffusing its warmth from thence to the extremities then certainly it would be less in proportion to the distance from that center  of course less under the equator than the poles on high mountains than in deep vallies but buffons theory is that this earth was once in a state of hot fusion and that it has been and still continues to be cooling what is the course of this process a heated body being surrounded by a colder one whether solid or fluid the heat which is itself a fluid flows into the colder body equally from every point of the hotter hence if a heated spheroid of iron cools to a given degree in a given space of time an inch deep from its surface in one point it has in the same time done the same in any  every other point in a given time more it will be cooled all round to double that depth so that it will always be equally cooled at equal depths from the surface this would be the case with buffons earth if it were a smooth figure without unevennesses but it has mountains and vallies the tops of mountains will cool to greater depths in the   0 same time than the sides of mountains  than plains in proportion as the line ab is longer than ac or de or fg in the valley the line hi or depth of the same temperature will be the same as on a plain this however is very different from  buffons opinion he sais that the earth being thinnest at the poles will cool sooner there than under the equator where it is thicker if my idea of the process of cooling be right his is wrong and his whole theory in the epochs of nature is overset the note which i delivered you contained an acknowledgment of my having borrowed from you a draught for    ⅓ dollars and a promise to repay it on demand this was exclusive of what i had borrowed in philadelphia we have never yet had more than   states and very seldom that as maryland is scarcely ever present and we are now without a hope of its attending till february consequently having six states only we do nothing expresses  letters are gone forth to hasten on the absent states that we may have       for a ratification of the definitive treaty jersey perhaps may come in and if beresford will not come to congress congress must go to him to do this one act even now it is full late the critical situation in which we are like to be gave birth to an idea that   might ratify but it could not be supported i will give you a further account of this when it shall be finally settled the letters of our ministers inform us that the two empires have formed a league defensive against christian powers  offensive agt the turks when announced by the empress to the k of prussia he answered that he was very sensible on it as one is when informed of important things france answered in a higher tone and offered to mediate if prussia will join france perhaps it may prevent the war if he does not it will be bold for france alone to take the aid of the turks on herself ireland is likely to find employment for england the united netherlands are in high fermentation the people now marshall themselves in arms and exercise regularly under the banners of their towns their object is to reduce the powers of the stadtholder i have forwarded your letter to mrs house mrs trist i expect left philadelphia about the   th of dec for pittsburgh i had a letter from her in which she complained of your not having written and desired me to mention it to you i made your excuse on the good grounds of the delays you must have experienced on your journey  your distance from the post road but i am afraid she was gone before my letter reached philadelphia i have had     very ill health since i have been here and am getting rather lower than otherwise thomas jefferson jan 0       mr jefferson mr williamson mr read mr gerry mr howell motion on ratification of treaty  c c jan

before the  d day of march next and there now remains before that period little more time than is requisite for the passage of the said ratification across the atlantic and congress consisting at present but of   states these differ in opinion some of them considering   as requisite under the confederation to the establishment of every treaty while others are of opinion that   having ratified the provisional treaty and instructed     their ministers to enter into a definitive one conformable thereto which is accordingly done seven may under these particular circumstances ratify what has been so declared by   to have their approbation and those of the former opinion being equally desirous with the latter that no power which may be supposed they possess should remain unexercised for the final ratification of this instrument provided it may be done with the preservation of good faith towards the other contracting party and without importing that congress has given any express opinion that the sd ratification is be or be not authorized by the confederation resolved therefore that the states now present in congress do declare their approbation and so far as they have power their ratification of the sd treaty that the same ratification in the usual form be duly attested under the seal of the states and transmitted to our ministers with instructions to keep the same     uncommunicated  to propose to the other contracting party a convention extending the time for the exchange of ratifications   months further that the sd ministers be informed that so soon as   states shall be present in congress the said treaty shall be submitted to them  their ratification when obtained shall be transmitted also that if they should receive the ratification by   states before the ultimate point of time allowed for exchange this alone be used  the former cancelled that if it should not be received in time they then produce the act of the   states  give the same in exchange informing the other contracting party that the sd treaty came to hand when congress was not in session that   states only had assembled that this ratification has been expedited with their unanimous consent and offering it in exchange for theirs with an assurance that it will be followed by another expedited in all its forms by nine states so soon as they shall be assembled which shall be

books you read what tunes you play and to receive specimens of your drawing with respect to your meeting m simitière  at mr rittenhouses nothing could give me more pleasure than your being much with that worthy family wherein you will see the best     examples of rational life and learn to esteem and copy them but i should be very tender of intruding you on the family as it might perhaps be not always convenient for you to be there at your hours of attending m simitière i can only say then that if it has been desired by mr and mrs rittenhouse in such a manner as that mrs hopkinson shall be satisfied that they will not think it inconvenient i would have you thankfully accept it and conduct yourself with so much attention to the family as that they may never feel themselves incommoded by it i hope mrs hopkinson will be as good as to act for you in this matter with that delicacy and prudence of which she is so capable i have much at heart your learning to draw and should be uneasy at your losing this opportunity which probably is your last thomas jefferson jan         annapolis benjamin harrison to the governor of virginia benjamin harrison v s a annapolis jan         sir —the southern post which had not come in for three weeks past surprised us by his arrival to day being to return in half an hour i could only after a perusal of my letters hastily inclose to your excellency a copy of the proclamation announcing the ratification of the peace which we were enabled to expedite on the   th inst that being the first day on which nine states have attended during the present congress this irregularity in the post will account for your having received no letter from mr   0 hardy the corresponding member for the month an indisposition at present puts it out of his power to write in which case according to our arrangement the duty devolves on the next member in the nomination the right of individual correspondence however still remaining to us i take the liberty of communicating the occurrences of the time the important subjects now before congress are   authorizing our foreign ministers to enter into treaties of alliance  commerce with the several nations who have desired it   arranging the domestic administration   establishing arsenals within the states  posts on our frontier   disposing of the western territory   treaties of peace and purchase with the indians   money your excellency will perceive that these are questions of such difficulty as must produce differences of opinion and of such importance as forbid a sacrifice of judgment to one another we have but nine states present seven of which are represented by only two members each there are    gentlemen then any one of which differing from the rest stops our proceeding for all these questions require the concurrence of nine states we shall proceed in a day or two to take them up and it is my expectation that after having tried several of them successively and finding it impossible to obtain a single determination congress will find it necessary to adjourn till the spring first informing the states that they adjourn because from the inattendance of members their     business cannot be done recommending to them to instruct  enable their members to come on at the day appointed and that they constantly keep three at least with congress while it shall be sitting i believe if we had thirteen states present represented by three members each we could clear off our business in two or three months and that hereafter a session of two or three months in the year could suffice the manifesto of the empress of russia against the turks is come to hand—it is flimsy and groundless as that of the turks is strong  substantial  masterly thomas jefferson jan

to the superintendent of finance  robert morris j mss february        a grand committee of congress is now engaged in preparing estimates of the necessary federal expenses of the present year from the first to the last day of it inclusive and of the articles of interest on the public debts foreign  domestic which call indispensably for immediate provision while the impost proposed ultimately for their discharge shall be on its passage through the states these estimates are to lead to a new requisition of money from the     states but the commee have hopes that this new requisition may be lessened if not altogether dispensed with provided a full compliance can be obtained with the former requisitions of nov        for   millions of dollars  of octob  0      for   millions of dollars they suppose that the requisn of   millions was greater than all the objects of it did in event require they suppose further that some of these objects have been transferred to other funds of course there will be a surplus remaining after all the demands against this requisition which have been paid  payable out of this fund in like manner   m having been part of   millns estimated on a war establmt and peace taking place immediately after they expect a surplus may remain on this also after all paiments made  to be made out of it these surplusses which will be reached by no former appropriation  which are therefore fairly open to be newly appropriated they ask of you to estimate according to the best of your information that they may see how far an enforcement of them will go toward supplying the demands of the current year but that they may know how to call on the several states to pay up their deficiencies it will be necessary also for you to inform them what proportion of these requisitions had been paid up by each state to the  st day of jan      another object claimed the attention of the commee by a vote of sept          00000 dollars were required from the states for the special purpose of paying interest with a permission to them to pay first out of their quotas the interest on loan     office certificates and other liquidated debts loaned or contracted in their own states so that the balance only was to be remitted to the continental treasury have any such balances been remitted or have you any information how far the several states have proceeded in compliance to comply with this requisition by paimt of interest within their own state or loan office certificates if you have we shall be obliged to you for it a former commee had been appointed to revise the civil list and to adapt it to the change of circumstances which peace has induced they have gone through that work  reported except so far as it relates to the department of finance by which i mean to include the establishments of in the several offices of the superintendt comptroller auditor register treasurer  the commers for settling the accts in the several states and the accts of the staff departments they hope from your letter in answer to one written you by dr williamson their chairman that you are turning your attention to this subject and that you will be so kind as to inform them whether any of the offices or officers may be dispensed with under present circumstances so as to lessen its expenses without endangering more substantial loss a true  laudable œconomy being their object i take the liberty of mentioning this subject to you only because the grand commee under whose instructions i write to you will of course be delayed in their estimates till the other commee shall have made a full report on the civil list with you i know it is unnecessary to urge as early     an answer as is practicable and have therefore only to add assurances of the sincere respect  esteem with which i have the honor to be c thomas jefferson feb  0      annapolis james madison to james madison mad mss annapolis feb  0      dear sir —your favour of the   th inst came to hand this day i had prepared a multitude of memons of subjects whereon to write you but i will first answer those arising from your letter by the time my order got to philadelphia every copy of smiths history of new york was sold i shall take care to get blairs lectures for you as soon as published and will attend to your presumed wishes whenever i meet with anything rare  of worth i wish i knew better what things of this kind you have collected for yourself as i may often doubt whether you have or have not a thing i know of no objections to the printing the revisal on the contrary i think good will result from it should this be decided i must make a short trip to virginia as from the loss of originals i believe my copies must often be wanting  i had never met with the particular fact relative to the grinders of the incognitum found in brasil  lima  deposited in the british museum which you mention from dr hunter i know it has been said that in a very few instances such bones have been found in s america you will find a collection of   0 these in   buff epoq de la nature     but they have been so illy attested so loosely  ignorantly described and so seldom even pretended to have been seen that i have supposed their identity with the northern bones  perhaps their existence at all not sufficiently established the authority of hunter is respectable but if this be the only well attested instance of those bones brought from s amera they may still be believed to have been first carried there either previous to the emigration of the spaniards when there was doubtless a communication between the indns of the two continents or after that emigration when an intercourse between the spaniards of n  s amera took place it would be unsafe to deny the fact but i think it may well be doubted i wish you had a thermometer mr madison of the college  myself are keeping observations for a comparison of climate we observe at sunrise  at four oclock p m which are the coldest  warmest points of the day if you could observe at the same time it would show the difference between going north  northwest on this continent i suspect it to be colder in orange or albemarle than here i think i informed you in my last that an attempt had been made to ratify the definitive treaty by seven states only and to impose this under the sanction of our seal without letting our actual state appear on the british court reade williamson  lee were violent for this and gave notice that when the question should be put they would call the yeas  nays  shew by whose fault the ratification of this important instrument should fail if it should fail i     prepared the enclosed resolution by way of protest  informed them i would place that also on the journals with the yeas  nays as a justification of those who opposed the proposition i believe this put a stop to it they suffered the question to rest undecided till the   th of jan when   states appeared  ratified colo harmer  colo franks were immediately dispatched to take passage to europe with copies of the ratification but by the extraordinary severity of the season we know they had not sailed on the  th inst the ratification will not therefore arrive in time being persuaded i shall be misrepresented within my own state if any difficulties should arise i inclose you a copy of the protest containing my reasons had the question been put there were but two states who would have voted for a ratification by seven the others would have been in the negative or divided—i find congress every moment stopped by questions whether the most trifling money propositions are not above the powers of seven states as being appropriations of money my idea is that the estimate for the year  requisition grounded on that whereon the sums to be allowed to each department are stated is the general appropriation which requires   states  that the detailing it out provided they do not go beyond these sums may be done by the subordinate officers of the federal government or by a congress of   states i wish you to think of this  give me your thoughts on the subject—we have as yet no secy of foreign affairs lee avows himself a candidate—the plan of foreign affairs likely to take place is to commission adams     franklin  jay to conclude treaties with the several european powers and then to return leaving the field to subordinate characters messrs adams  jay have paid a visit to the court of london unordered  uninvited their reception has been forbidding luzerne leaves in august whether recalled or on his own request is not known this information comes from himself tho is not as yet known  of publickly lee finding no faction among the     here entered into that among the         which rages to a very high degree a trial being appointed by the one party on a certain     he undertook to     one and fixed it on precisely the same     this of course has placed him in the midst of the mud he is  0  0       0      a       0             of         and of       0     expectation i have no doubt from some conversations with him that there is a design agitating to sever the western  0 0     and add it to this state he supported in conversation with me the propriety  necessity of such a general measure to wit of enlarging the small states to interest them in the   0        0 he deserves to be well switched in our state he is extremely soured with it and is not cautious in betraying his hostility against it we cannot make up a congress at all there are   states in town   of which are represented by two members only of these two members of different states are confined by the gout so that we cannot make a house we have not sat above   days i believe in as many weeks admonition after admonition has been sent to the states to no effect     we have sent one today if it fails it seems as well we should all retire there have never been   states on the floor but for the ratification of the treaty and a day of two after—georgetown languishes the smile is hardly covered now when the federal towns are spoken of i fear that our chance is at this time desperate our object therefore must be if we fail in an effort to remove to georgetown to endeavor then to get to some place off the waters of the chesapeak where we may be ensured against congress considering themselves as fixed my present expectations are that as soon as we get a congress to do business we shall attend to nothing but the most pressing matters get through them  adjourn not to meet again till november leaving a commee of the states that commee will be obliged to go immediately to philadelphia to examine the offices  of course they will sit there till the meeting in november whether that meeting will be in philadelphia or trenton will be the question and will in my opinion depend on the vote of new york  did not you once suppose in conversation with me that congress had no authority to decide any cases between two differing states except those of disputed territory i think you did if i am not mistaken in this i should wish to know your good sense of the words which describe those cases which may be submitted to a federal court they seem to me to comprehend every cause of difference we have received the act of our assembly ceding the lands north of ohio  are about executing a deed for it i think the territory will be laid out by     passing a meridian through the western cape of the mouth of the gr kanhaway from the ohio to l erie and another through the rapids of ohio from the same river to michigan  crossing these by the parallels of latitude   °   °   ° c allowing to each state an extent of  ° from n to south on the eastern side of the meridn of kanhaway will still be one new state to wit the territory lying between that meridian pennsylva the ohio  l erie we hope n carola will cede all beyond the same meridian of kanhaway  virginia also for gods sake push this at the next session of assembly we have transmitted a copy of a petition from the people of kentucky to congress praying to be separated from virginia congress took no notice of it we sent the copy to the governor desiring it to be laid before the assembly our view was to bring on the question it is for the interest of virginia to cede so far immediately because the people beyond that will separate themselves because they will be joined by all our settlements beyond the alleghany if they are the first movers whereas if we draw the line those at kentucky having their end will not interest themselves for the people of indiana greenbriar c who will of course be left to our management and i can with certainty almost say that congress would approve of the meridian of the mouth of the kanhaway and consider it as the ultimate point to be desired from virginia i form this opinion from conversation with many members should we not be the first movers and the indianians  kentuckians take themselves off and claim to the alleghany i am afraid     congress would secretly wish them well virginia is extremely interested to retain to that meridian   because the gr kanhaway runs from north to south across our whole county forming by its waters a belt of fine land which will be thickly seated  will form a strong barrier for us   because the country for   0 miles beyond that is an absolute desart barren  mountainous which can never be inhabited  will therefore be a fine separation between us  the next state   because the government of virginia is more convenient to the people on all the upper parts of kanhaway than any other which will be laid out   because our lead mines are in that country   because the kanhaway is capable of being made navigable and therefore gives entrance into the western waters to every part of our latitude   because it is not now navigable  can only be made so by expensive works which require that we should own the soil on both sides   because the ohio and its branches which head up against the patowmac affords the shortest water communication by  00 miles of any which can ever be got between the western waters  atlantic  of course promises us almost a monopoly of the western  indian trade i think the opening this navigation is an object on which no time is to be lost pennsylva is attending to the western commerce she has had surveys made of the river susquehanna and of the grounds thro which a canal must pass to go directly to philadelphia it is reported practicable at an expense of £ 00000 and they have determined to open it what an example this is if we do not push this     matter immediately they will be beforehand with us  get possession of the commerce and it is difficult to turn it from a channel in which it is once established could not our assembly be induced to lay a particular tax which should bring in   or  0000£ a year to be applied till the navigation of the ohio  patowmac is opened then james river  so on through the whole successively genl washington has that of the patowmac much at heart the superintendance of it would be a noble amusement in his retirement  leave a monument of him as long as the waters should flow i am of opinion he would accept of the direction as long as the money should be to be emploied on the patowmac  the popularity of his name would carry it thro the assembly the portage between yohogania  the n branch of patowmac is of  0 or  0 miles cheat river is navigable far up its head is within  0 miles of the head of the north branch of patowmac  i am informed offers the shortest  best portage—i wish in the next election of delegates for congress short could be sent his talents are great  his weight in our state must ere long become principal i see the best effects produced by sending our young statesmen here they see the affairs of the confederacy from a high ground they learn the importance of the union  befriend federal measures when they return those who never come here see our affairs insulated pursue a system of jealousy  self interest and distract the union as much as they can genl gates would supply shorts place in the council very well and would act he is now here     what will you do with the council they are expensive and not constantly nor often necessary yet to drop them would be wrong i think you had better require their attendance twice a year to examine the executive department  see that it be going on rightly advise on that subject the governor or inform the legislature as they shall see occasion give them  0 guineas each for each trip fill up only   of the places and let them be always subject to summons on great emergencies by the governor on which occasions their expences only should be paid at an expence of  00 guineas you will then preserve this member of the constitution always fit for use young  ambitious men will leave it  go into the assembly but the elderly  able who have retired from the legislative field as too turbulent will accept of the offices—among other legislative subjects our distresses ask notice i had been from home four months  had expended   00 dollars before i received one farthing by the last post we received about seven weeks allowance in the meantime some of us had had the mortification to have our horses turned out of the livery stable for want of money there is really no standing this the supply gives us no relief because it was mortgaged we are trying to get something more effectual from the treasury having sent an express to inform them of our predicament i shall endeavour to place as much in the philadelphia bank as will repay your kindness unless you should alter your mind  chuse to take it in the virginia treasury—i have hunted out chatellux journal  had a reading     of it i had never so falsely estimated the character of a book there are about six sentences of offensive bagatelles which are all of them publicly known because having respected individual characters they were like carrion for the buzzard curiosity all the rest of the book and it is a  to of     pages is either entertaining or instructive  would be highly flattering to the americans he has visited all the principal fields of battle enquired minutely into the detail of the actions  has given what are probably the best accounts extant of them he often finds occasion to criticise  to deny the british accounts from an inspection of the ground i think to write to him recommend the expunging the few exceptionable passages  publication of the rest—i have had an opportunity here of examining bynkershoeks works there are about a fourth part of them which you would like to have they are the following tracts questiones juris publici—de lege rhodeâ—de dominio maris—du fuge conopetent des

comprehensive  most accurate body of natl philosophy which has been ever published i would recommend to you to get it or i will get that and any other books you want from boirod or elsewhere i hope you have found access to my library i beg you to make free use of it key the steward is living there now  of course will be always in the way monroe is buying     land almost adjoining me short will do the same what would i not give if you could fall into the circle with such a society i could once more venture home  lay myself up for the residue of life quitting all its contentions which grow daily more and more insupportable think of it to render it practicable only requires you to think it so life is of no value but as it brings us gratifications among the most valuable of these is rational society it informs the mind sweetens the temper chears our spirits and promotes health there is a little farm of   0 as adjoining me  within two miles all of good land tho old with a small

no difference we executed the ratification in time and its passage across the atlantic was prevented by circumstances not under our controul the accomodation of the turks and russians leaving europe in peace and france of course at liberty keeps us safe this accomodation is said to have been effected by the interposition of france  prussia this does not come from our ministers from whom we have had no late intelligence on this subject but is told me by monsr marbois who sais he has it from good information we are still farther insured against any ill effect from this accident if the news of

the lords when they resigned and that mr pitt  his friends would be at the head of the administration the prince of wales voted against the bill  received a repremand from the king—so far the papers

instructed as far as they shall be in their power find it convenient to treat with the several nations every tribe at different times  places  where necessity     shall oblige them to bring two or more tribes nations together that they are still to keep their treaties  conferences as destinct as may be that they make known to the shawanese  delawares that these united states consider them as independent nations  will protect them as such that they countenance every disposition in any one of the six nations to treat  act separately  independently of their confederacy and that in general

post does not usually stay here above an hour it leaves me time to scribble a few lines only scarcely admitting them to be prefaced with an acknowledgement of the pleasure it will give me to be permitted to communicate with you occasionally we received dispatches from europe yesterday by capt barney there is no news but in one from dr franklin of dec    and another from the marquis fayette of dec    the doctor tells us only of the movements of our ministers that mr laurens was about sailing from england for america mr adams about setting out from england to the hague and mr jay at bath     he gives a picture of the disposition of england towards us he observes that tho they have made peace with us they are not reconciled to us nor to the loss of us he calls to our attention the numerous royal progeny to be provided for the military education giving to some of them the ideas in england of the distraction among ourselves that the people here are already fatigued with their new governments the possibility of circumstances arising on the continent of europe which might countenance the wishes of gr britain to recover us and from thence inculcates a useful lesson to cement the friendships we posses in europe the marquis tells us the turks  russians will be kept apart for a while probably for another year but that they must in the end come to decision that mr fox  ld north were both out of the ministry  this by a maneuvre of the kings who got them compromitted fairly with their e india bill  contrived to get it rejected in the lords  that mr pitt  e temple would come in the marquis himself will sail for america in the spring the present hurry forbids me to write to you on a subject i have much at heart the approaching  opening the navigation of the ohio  patowmac i will trouble you by the next post de witts petition happens to be in my possession as member of a committee who have not yet reported on it i was happy to learn from you something of the man     thomas jefferson mar         annapolis george washington to george washington w mss annapolis mar         dr sir —since my last nothing new has occurred i suppose the crippled state of congress is not new to you we have only   states present   of whom are represented by two members each and of course on all great questions not only an unanimity of states but of members is necessary an unanimity which can never be obtained on a matter of any importance the consequence is that we are wasting our time  labour in vain efforts to do business—nothing less than the presence of    states represented by an odd number of delegates will enable us to get forward a single capital point the deed for the cession of western territory by virginia was executed  accepted on the  st instant i hope our country will of herself determine to cede still further to the meridian of the mouth of the great kanhaway further she cannot govern so far is necessary for her own well being the reasons which call for this boundary which will retain all the waters of the kanhaway are   that within that are our lead mines   this river rising in n carola traverses our whole latitude and offers to every part of it a channel for navigation  commerce to the western country but   it is a channel which can not be opened but at immense expense and with every facility which an absolute power over both shores will give   this river  its waters forms a band of good land passing along our whole frontier and forming on it a barrier which will be strongly seated   for   0 miles beyond these waters is a mountainous barren     which can never be inhabited  will of course form a safe separation between us  any other state   this tract of country lies more convenient to receive its government from virginia than from any other state   it will preserve to us all the upper parts of yohogany  cheat rivers within which much will be done to open these which are the true doors to the western commerce the union of this navigation with that of the patowmac is a subject on which i mentioned that i would take the liberty of writing to you i am sure its value and practicability are both well known to you this is the moment however for seizing it if ever we mean to have it all the world is becoming commercial was it practicable to keep our new empire separated from them we might indulge ourselves in speculating whether commerce contributes to the happiness of mankind but we cannot separate ourselves from them our citizens have had too full a taste of the comforts furnished by the arts  manufactures to be debarred the use of them we must then in our defence endeavour to share as large a portion as we can of this modern source of wealth  power that offered to us from the western country is under a competition between the hudson the patowmac  the missisipi itself down the last will pass all heavy commodities but the navigation through the gulf of mexico is so dangerous  that up the missisipi so difficult  tedious that it is not probable that european merchandize will return through that channel it is most likely that flour lumber  other heavy articles will be floated on rafts which     will be themselves an article of sale as well as their loading the navigators returning by land or in light batteaux there will therefore be a rivalship between the hudson  patowmac for the residue of the commerce of all the country westward of l erie on the waters of the lakes of the ohio  upper parts of the missisipi to go to n york that part of the trade which comes from the lakes or their waters must first be brought into l erie so also must that which comes from the waters of the missisipi and of course must cross at some portage into the waters of the lakes when it shall have entered l erie it must coast along its southern shore on account of the number  excellence of its harbours the northern tho shortest having few harbours  these unsafe having reached cuyahoga to proceed on to n york will be   0 miles from thence  five portages whereas it is but   0 miles to alexandria if it turns into the cuyahoga  passes through that big beaver ohio yohogany or monongahela  cheat  patowmac  there are but two portages for the trade of the ohio or that which shall come into it from its own waters or the missisipi it is nearer to alexandria than to new york by   0 miles and is interrupted by one portage only nature then has declared in favour of the patowmac and through that channel offers to pour into our lap the whole commerce of the western world but unfortunately the channel by the hudson is already open  known to practice ours is still to be opened this is the moment in which the trade of the west will begin to get into motion and to     take its direction it behoves us then to open our doors to it i have lately pressed this subject on my friends in the general assembly proposing to them to endeavor to have a tax laid which shall bring into a separate chest from five to ten thousand pounds a year to be employed first in opening the upper waters of the ohio  patowmac where a little money  time will do a great deal leaving the great falls for the last part of the work to remove the idea of partiality i have suggested the propriety  justice of continuing this fund till all the rivers shall be cleared successively but a most powerful objection always arises to propositions of this kind it is that public undertakings are carelessly managed and much money spent to little purpose to obviate this objection is the purpose of my giving you the trouble of this discussion you have retired from public life you have weighed this determination  it would be impertinence in me to touch it but would the superintendence of this work break in too much on the sweets of retirement  repose if they would i stop here your future time  wishes are sacred in my eye if it would be only a dignified amusement to you what a monument of your retirement would it be it is one which would follow that of your public life and bespeak it the work of the same great hand i am confident that would you either alone or jointly with any persons you think proper be willing to direct this business it would remove the only objection the weight of which i apprehend tho the tax should not come in till the fall its proceeds should be anticipated by   0 borrowing from some other fund to enable the work to be begun this summer when you view me as not owning nor ever having a prospect of owning one inch of land on any water either of the patowmac or ohio it will tend to apologize for the trouble i have given you of this long letter by showing that my zeal in this business is public  pure the best atonement for the time i have occupied you will be not to add to it longer than while i assure you of the sincerity  esteem with which i have the honour to be dr sir your most obedient  most humble servt p s the hurry of time in my former

the idea i know he will be worse to me than a return of my double quotidian headach there is a resolution reported to congress by a committee that     they will never appoint to the office of minister chargé des affaires consul agent c describing the foreign emploiments any but natives to this i think there will not be a dissenting vote and it will be taken up among the first things could you not by making him acquainted with this divert him from coming here a consulate is his object in which he will assuredly fail but his coming will be attended with evil he is the violent enemy of franklin having been some time at paris from my knowledge of the man i am sure he will have employed himself in collecting on the spot facts true or false to impeach him you know there are people here who on the first idea of this will take him to their bosom  turn all congress topsy turvy for gods sake then save us from this confusion if you can we have eight states only    of these represented by two

letter which had come here supposed the king a friend to the e india bill  that the prince voted against it the marquis said that the king by a special maneuvre got fox  north committed on the fate of their bill which they carried through the commons but his practices were disappointed in the lords in which latter stage the prince voted for the bill in opposition to his father dr franklins letter containing an interesting paragraph i have copied it  take the liberty of inclosing     it  we have had no post since that which carried my letter of the  d nor are we certain when to expect one i am therefore obliged to have letters in readiness to send the moment of his coming as he does not tary above an hour here hence it happens that my letters are sometimes a week or a fortnight old before

to paris     thomas jefferson gerry williamson march      resolves on european treaties  j mss march      resolved that treaties of amity  commerce with the european nations ought not to be refused on our part until those nations will send ministers to negotiate them within these states nor ought they to be delayed until they shall have previously been submitted to the several legislatures  received their approbation   because it is not to be expected that the nations of europe antient  established as they are will cross the atlantic to treat with us on our own ground   because a refusal to treat with them in europe amounts to a refusal to treat with them at all to the suppression of every effort for the admission of our citizens into their ports on an equal footing with those of other countries to a continuance of the occlusion of the west indian markets against the produce of these states loses a crisis of favourable disposition in the european powers in general to enter into connections of amity and commerce with us endangers the loss of a proffered treaty from the emperor of morocco who has made us friendly advances whose honour will be touched and resentment kindled by our declining to meet them and whose power  connections may in our present unarmed state shut to us the ports of the mediterranean     oblige us to send our commodities to them in foreign bottoms or to seek them in our own at the risk of consigning our citizens to perpetual slavery  chains   because the federal constitution does not require that treaties before their conclusion should be communicated to the thirteen legislatures and should receive all their several approbations and such a delay in the present instance would be unseasonable  injurious to them would protract the negotiations to a length indefinite both in time  expence would leave our citizens in the mean time exposed to all the evils before stated would be more distressing to these states whose channels of commerce are yet to be opened than to the nations constituting the other parties who may in the mean time pursue their antient  long established trade and might suffer opportunities finally to pass by which might never be recalled thomas jefferson march         report of government for the western territory  cc march         the committee to whom was recommitted the the report of a plan for a temporary government     of the western territory have agreed to the following resolutions resolved that so much of the territory ceded or to be ceded by individual states to the united states as is already purchased or shall be purchased of the none      indian inhabitants  offered for sale by congress shall be divided into distinct states in the following manner as nearly as such cessions will admit that is to say by parallels of latitude so that each state shall comprehend from south to north two degrees of latitude beginning to count from the completion of thirtyone degrees north of the equator and by meridians of longitude one of which shall pass thro the lowest point of the rapids of ohio and the other through the western cape of the mouth of the great kanhaway but the territory eastward of this last meridian between the ohio lake erie  pennsylvania shall be one state whatsoever may be its comprehension of latitude that which may lie beyond the completion of the   th degree between the sd meridians shall make part of the state adjoining it on the south and that part of the ohio which is between the same meridians coinciding nearly with the parallel of   ° shall be substituted so far in lieu of that parallel as a boundary line that the settlers on any territory so purchased  offered for sale shall either on their own petition or on the order of congress receive authority from them with appointments of time  place for their free males of full age within the limits of their state to meet together for the purpose of establishing a temporary government to adopt the constitution and laws of any one of the original states so that such laws nevertheless shall be subject to alteration by their ordinary legislature  to erect subject to a like alteration counties or townships for the election of members for their legislature     that such temporary government shall only continue in force in any state until it shall have acquired  0000 free inhabitants when giving due proof thereof to congress they shall receive from them authority with appointment of time  place to call a convention of representatives to establish a permanent constitution  government for themselves provided that both the temporary  permanent governments be established on these principles as their basis   that they shall forever remain a part of this confederacy of the united states of america   that in their persons property  territory they shall be subject to the government of the united states in congress assembled  to the articles of confederation in all those cases in which the original states shall be so subject   that they shall be subject to pay a part of the federal debts contracted or to be contracted to be apportioned on them by congress according to the same common rule  measure by which apportionments thereof shall be made on the other states   that their respective governments shall be in republican forms and shall admit no person to be a citizen who holds any hereditary title   that after the year   00 of the christian æra there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the sd states otherwise than in punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been convicted to have been personally guilty that whensoever any of the sd states shall have of free inhabitants as many as shall then be in any one of the least numerous of the thirteen original states such state shall be admitted by its delegates     into the congress of the united states on an equal footing with the said original states provided nine states agree to such admission according to the reservation of the   th of the articles of confederation and in order to adapt the sd articles of confederation to the state of congress when its numbers shall be thus increased it shall be proposed to the legislatures of the states originally parties thereto to require the assent of two thirds of the united states in congress assembled in all those cases wherein by the said articles the assent of nine states is now required which being agreed to by them shall be binding on the new states until such admission by their delegates into congress any of the said states after the establishment of their temporary government shall have authority to keep a sitting member in congress with a right of debating but not of voting that the preceding articles shall be formed into a charter of compact shall be duly executed by the president of the united states in congress assembled under his hand  the seal of the united states shall be promulgated  shall stand as fundamental constitutions between the thirteen original states and each of the several states now newly described unalterable but by the joint consent of the united states in congress assembled  of the particular state within which such alteration is proposed to be made that measures not inconsistent with the principles of the confedn  necessary for the preservation of peace  good order among the settlers in any of the   0 said new states until they shall assume a temporary government as aforesaid may from time to time be taken by the u s in c assembled thomas jefferson march         report on cession of western territory  c c march         the report of a committee on the subject of western territory having been referred to the grand committee they have had the same under their consideration and agreed to the following report congress by their resolution of sep      0 having thought it adviseable to press upon the states having claims to the western country a liberal surrender of a portion of their territorial claims by that of the  0th of oct in the same year having fixed the conditions to which the union should be bound on receiving such cessions and having again proposed the same subject to those states in their address of april      wherein stating the national debt  its annual interest they recommended for the discharge of the interest the plan of an impost on commerce now under consideration with the states with such subsidiary funds as they might judge most convenient  for the discharge of the principal  expressing some their reliance for its discharge on other resources but chiefly on the prospect of vacant territory in aid of other resources they for that purpose as well as to obviate disagreeable controversies  confusions included in the same recommendation     a renewal of those of sep the  th  of oct the  0th    0 which several recommendations have not yet been finally complied with resolved that the same subject be again presented to the attention of the said states that they be urged to consider that the war being now brought to a happy termination by the personal services of our souldiers the supplies of property by our citizens  loans of money from them as well as from foreigners these several creditors have a right to call for a precise designation of the funds expect that funds shall be provided on which they are to may rely for indemnification that congress still consider vacant territory as the a capital resource that this too is the time when our confederacy with all the territory included within its limits should assume its ultimate and permanent form  that therefore the sd states be earnestly pressed by immediate  liberal cessions to forward these necessary ends  to remove those obstacles which disturb the harmony of the union which embarrass its councils  obstruct its operations thomas jefferson march         report of the arrears of interest  c c march         the grand committee consisting of appointed to prepare and report to congress the arrears of interest on the national debt together with     the interest and expences for the year      from the first to the last day thereof inclusive and a requisition of money on the states for discharging the same have agreed to the following report resolved that there will be wanting for arrears of interest and for the interest  services of the present year      from the first to the last day thereof inclusive the following sums expressed in dollars tenths and hundredths of dollars          the committee were apprized that the resolutions of congress of apr the   th      had recommended to the several states the raising an annual revenue by the establishment of certain imposts for the purpose of discharging the national debt principal and interest but it occurred to them that those recommendations were still before several of the legislatures that however desirable a compliance therewith is for the preservation of our faith  establishment of a national credit yet as time had already elapsed and more must elapse before their final confirmation can be hoped at after it shall be obtained time will also be requisite to advance the plan to the term of actual collection good faith requires that in the mean while other measures should be resorted to for the purpose of discharging the growing interest in the statement of the interest due at the close of the year      the committee have supposed its amount lessened by   00000 dollars required  apportioned by the resolutions of congress of sep the  th and  0th       appropriated to the sole purpose of paying the interest of the public debt this requisition gave license to the states to apply so much as should be necessary of their respective quotas of it to the payment of interest due on certificates issued from the loan office of their own states  other liquidated debts of the united states contracted therein hence they suppose it has happened that the actual payment of these quotas have been uncommunicated to the office of finance for the united states the committee are of     opinion that the states should be desired to communicate to the superintendant of finance the payments they have made under this requisition  where they have been incomplete to hasten their completion as the means still relied on by congress for the discharge of that part of the interest of the public debt and while on this subject they beg leave to add that from the representation to congress by the minister of france referred to this committee they learn that in some of the states a discrimination has taken place between the citizens of their own  subjects or citizens of other countries which was not authorized by the said resolution they are of opinion that such states should be requested to revise  reform their proceedings herein and to extend the benefits of this provision equally and impartially to all persons within its description your committee came then to consider in what way it would be best to call for the sums requisite for the services before stated and they thought it their duty in the first place to enquire whether no surpluses might remain on former requisitions of congress after effecting fully the purposes were effected to which they were originally appropriated under an assurance that it would be both the duty and sense of congress to apply such surpluses in every instance towards lessening the next requisitions on the states they found in fact that such a surplus would remain on the requisition of oct  0      for eight millions of dollars for the services of the ensuing year and that this surplus would be great from the following circumstances     that requisition was estimated on supposition that the continental army would be completed by the states to its full establishment and that cloathing subsistence  other necessaries for such an army must of course be provided the states were far short of producing such an army hence the calls for money were proportionably abridged it was estimated too on the further supposition that we might be disappointed in the endeavors we were then exerting to borrow money both at home  abroad and of course that the whole must be supplied by taxes loans however were obtained and the surplus increased by this second cause a third circumstance has further enlarged it the payments on this requisition have been small  slow hence instead of money those who served  supplied the united states have received certificates only that money is due to them and these debts have been transferred to the fund proposed to be raised by way of impost so that tho the debts exist they are removed from this to another fund to know then the amount of this surplus the committee extended their enquiries to the sums actually received under this requisition the purposes to which they have been applied and the anticipations thereof still unsatisfied they found that           only of the eight millions of dollars had been received at the treasury at the close of the year      that these had been applied to the services of the years            and that for other services of the same years debts were contracted to the amount of about one million of dollars more     which depend for their discharge on further receipts under this requisition your committee then are of opinion that a surplus of           dollars will remain of this requisition after answering all the demands which actually rose against it which were not answered by other means nor transferred to other funds and that this surplus ought to be applied so far as it will go to the common purposes of the united states so as to prevent new requisitions on them till the old shall have been exhausted and to shew to those who may have paid their whole quota of any requisition that they will not be called on anew till all the other states shall in like manner have paid up their quotas your committee found also that there was a requisition of congress of oct         for   millions of dollars for the services of the year      on which some small payments had been tendered but that the superintendant of finance had found it better to receive and credit them as part of the eight millions they are accordingly comprehended in the sum before stated to have been paid in under that head having thus stated the demands existing against the states the committee would have performed but half their duty had they passed over unnoticed their condition to pay them their abilities must be measured in weighing their burthens their creditors themselves will view them just relieved from the ravages of predatory armies returning from an attendance on camps to the culture of their fields beginning to sow but not having reaped     exhausted of necessaries  habitual comforts and therefore needing new supplies out of the first proceeds of their labour forbearance then to a certain degree will suggest itself to them those entrusted with the dispensation of justice between them will suppose both parties desirous that their mutual situations should be considered  accommodated your committee are of opinion that if the whole balances of the two requisitions of eight and of two millions should be rigorously called into payment within the course of the present year a compliance with such call would produce much distress and that some term short of this should be fixed on within the reach of the least as well as of the most able states they propose therefore that the states be required to furnish within the course of the present year such part of their deficiencies under the requisitions of   millions as with their payments to the close of the last year will make up three fourths of their original quota thereof and that these payments be appropriated to the services of the present year      in conformity with the statement in the first part of this report giving generally where accommodation cannot be effected among the several objects a preference according to the order in which they are arranged in the sd statement but while this proportion of the former deficiencies is of necessity called for under the pressure of demands which will admit neither denial nor delay the committee must acknowledge that even the punctual compliance expected from all the states will not effect completely all the purposes of their     preceding statement to accomplish these perfectly to enable the federal administration to fulfil the whole of those just  desirable objects they wish earnestly  warmly to encourage the abler states to go as far beyond this proposition as their happier situation will admit under an assurance that their further contributions will be applied towards reducing the interest  principal of the public debt  will be placed to their credit in the next requisitions with interest thereon from the time of payment individual states have at times thought it hard that while in their own opinion they were in advance for the united states on accounts existing  unsettled between them they should yet be called on to furnish actual contributions of money your the committee observe in answer to this first that almost every state thinks itself in advance and secondly that it has been the constant wish of congress that these accounts should be settled  the contributions of each be known  credited they have accordingly put it in the power of the states to effect these settlements and as a further encouragement to hasten this desirable work the committee are of opinion congress should declare that so soon as these accounts shall be all settled and it shall appear in favor of what states balances arise such states shall have credit for the same in the requisitions next ensuing but it will be necessary also to remind the states that no materials have yet been furnished to enable congress to adjust the ultimate ratio in which the   0 expenditures of the late war shall be apportioned on the states the confederation directs that this shall be regulated by the value of the lands in the several states with the buildings  improvements thereon experiments made however since the date of that instrument for the purposes of ordinary taxation had induced doubts both as to the practicability of this rule of apportionment and of its equality apportionable yet congress thought it their duty to give it fair trial and recommended to the several states on the   th of feb      to furnish an account of their lands buildings  number of inhabitants whereon they might proceed to estimate their respective quotas but apprehending the incompetence of the rule would immediately shew itself and desirous that no time should be unnecessarily lost they followed it with another recommendation of the   th of apr      to substitute in lieu of that article in the confederation another which should make the number of inhabitants under certain modifications the measure of contribution for each state both these propositions are still under reference to the several legislatures the latter accompanied by the earnest wishes  preference of congress under full conviction that it will be found in event the most as equal the most more satisfactory  most more easy of execution the former only pressed if the other should be rejected the committee is informed that the states of connecticut new jersey pennsylvania  s carolina have acceded to the alteration proposed but have no evidence that the other states have as yet decided     thereon as it is necessary that the one or the other measure should be immediately resorted to they are of opinion it should be recommended to the legislatures which have not yet decided between them to come to decision at their next meeting in order to present to the eye a general view of the several existing requisitions  of the payments made under them the committee has subjoined them in the form of a table wherein the  st column enumerates the states the  d the apportionment of the d  00000 the  d that of the   millions the  th that of the   millions the  th the sums paid by the several states in part of their respective quotas to the last day of the year      and the  th the sums now required to made up three fourths of their respective quotas of the

00000  000000  000000                  0      it remained lastly to consider whether no facilities might be given to the paiment of these sums by the several states the committee observed that of the purposes for which money is wanting about a moiety can be answered by nothing but money itself but that the other moiety consisting of interest on our domestic debt may be effected by procuring a discount of the demand in the hands of the holder an operation which will be shorter  less impoverishing to the state and however in times of greater plenty the accuracy of fiscal administration might require all transactions to be in actual money at the treasury itself yet till our constituents shall have had some respite from their late difficulties it behoves us to prefer their easement the committee are therefore of opinion that the several legislatures may be admitted so to model the collection of the sums now called for as that the one half being paid in actual money the other may be discharged by procuring discounts of interest with our domestic creditors only taking care that the collection of money shall proceed at least in equal pace with the operations of discount and to ascertain the evidence of discount which shall be receivable in lieu of money the holders of loan office certificates shall be at liberty to carry them to the office from which they issued and the holders of certificates of other liquidated debts of the united states to carry the same to the loan office of that state wherein the debt was contracted and to have the interest due thereon settled  certified to the last day of the year      for which interest the loan     officer shall give a certificate in such form and under such cautions  instructions as the superintendant of finance shall transmit to him which certificates of interest being parted with by the holder of the principal shall be deemed evidence that he has received satisfaction for the same  therefore shall be receivable from the bearer within the same state in lieu of money in the proportion before stated and where loan office certificates issued after the  st day of mar      shall be presented to the loan officer they shall be reduced to their specie value according to the resolutions of congress of june       0 that specie value expressed on some part of the certificate  the interest thereon settled

suppose to have been brought this your servant now receives being obliged to seize a moment in congress of writing you these few lines i can only mention to you that late advices from europe mention another revolution in the british ministry mr pitt  his friends having resigned no new ministry was formed this does not come however authentically     thomas jefferson apr        annapolis benjamin harrison to the governor of virginia  benjamin harrison annapolis apr        sir —we have received no foreign intelligence through any authentic channel since the letter of dr franklin of dec    an extract from which i formerly did myself the honour of enclosing to you through different ways however such as to merit belief we have information that the utmost confusion prevails in the british government the house of commons on the   th of january came to a vote that the ministry mr pitt  his associates neither possessed nor ought to possess the confidence of the nation one account sais that on this mr pitt resigned another that he had not resigned and that the doubt was whether the king would dissolve the parliament or part with his ministry the error in the composition of the administration seems to have been the filling it from the house of lords and taking in not enough of the men of interest and talents in the house of commons matters on the continent are quiet the emperor  dutch have appointed commissioners to settle their differences whether his object was to have opened the scheld or whether the dispute arose about contested territory seems not very clear i should have added to the above intelligence that the city of london were warm for mr pitt and had addressed the king to continue his favor to him—your letter from mount vernon came safely to hand we have eleven states in congress     and are applying ourselves solely to the important subjects i am not without hopes that we shall be able by the first of may to adjourn till november nothing could prevent it but the loss of votes sometimes by divisions of the states   of the    being represented by two members only any three of the sixteen members can still defeat our endeavors and your knowledge of men will suggest to you the possibility of   dissenting voices out of    on any question mr mercer the corresponding member for the month will perhaps be able to supply any intelligence which may escape me thomas jefferson apr        annapolis george washington to george washington w mss annapolis apr        dear sir —i am obliged to you for your query as to the distance from new

    miles oneida     oswego     niagara   0    0    0    0 from niagara to cuyahoga   0 this last distance i     collect by measuring on hutchins map  reducing that proportionably by the known distance from niagara to detroit which is   0 miles the public papers confirm the resignation of mr pitt  his friends a ship arrived here  some others in philadelphia have brought us a riddle without a key they received their bounties  drawbacks on clearing out from london as they used to do while we were colonies without any public act authorizing it being visible the custom house officers tendered them  they were not so rude as to refuse them the prohibitory proclamation they say is eluded  connived at by government we have    states in congress  hope by the middle of may to adjourn to november if anything prevents this it will be the representation of   states of the    by   members each who frequently dividing retard business extremely—the inclosed letter was put into my hands with a request to forward it to you—this will be delivered you by monsr de hogendorff a relation of mr van berchels a very particular acquaintance with him here has led me to consider him as the best informed man of his age i have ever seen nature  application seem equally to have concurred in fitting him for important business he returns to holland his native country in the summer and cannot deny himself the satisfaction of paying his tribute of respect to you p s the minister of france arrived here today i believe he is on a tour through virginia but i have not yet learned when he sets out since writing this i learn that the minister has declined his tour     through virginia but thinks to go as far as your house perhaps within a fortnight thomas jefferson apr      notes on the establishment of a money unit and of a coinage for the united states  april      in fixing the unit of money these circumstances are of principal importance i that it be of convenient size to be applied as a measure to the common money transactions of life ii that its parts and multiples be in an easy proportion to each other so as to facilitate the money arithmetic iii that the unit and its parts or divisions be so nearly of the value of some of the known coins as that they may be of easy adoption for the people the spanish dollar seems to fulfill all these conditions i taking into our view all money transactions great and small i question if a common measure of more convenient size than the dollar could be proposed the value of  00  000  0000 dollars is well estimated by the mind so is that of the tenth or the hundredth of a dollar few transactions are     above or below these limits the expediency of attending to the size of the money unit will be evident to any one who will consider how inconvenient it would be to a manufacturer or merchant if instead of the yard for measuring cloth either the inch or the mile had been made the unit of measure ii the most easy ratio of multiplication and division is that by ten every one knows the facility of decimal arithmetic every one remembers that when learning moneyarithmetic he used to be puzzled with adding the farthings taking out the fours and carrying them on adding the pence taking out the twelves and carrying them on adding the shillings taking out the twenties and carrying them on but when he came to the pounds where he had only tens to carry forward it was easy and free from error the bulk of mankind are schoolboys through life these little perplexities are always great to them and even mathematical heads feel the relief of an easier substituted for a more difficult process foreigners too who trade and travel among us will find a great facility in understanding our coins and accounts from this ratio of subdivision those who have had occasion to convert the livres sols and deniers of the french the gilders stivers and frenings of the dutch the pounds shillings pence and farthings of these several states into each other can judge how much they would have been aided had their several subdivisions been in a decimal ratio certainly in all cases where we are free to choose between easy and difficult modes of operation it is most rational to choose     the easy the financier therefore in his report well proposes that our coins should be in decimal proportions to one another if we adopt the dollar for our unit we should strike four coins one of gold two of silver and one of copper viz     a golden piece equal in value to ten dollars     the unit or dollar itself of silver     the tenth of a dollar of silver also     the hundredth of a dollar of copper compare the arithmetical operations on the same sum of money expressed in this form and expressed in the pound sterling and its division  a bare inspection of the above operations will evince the labor which is occasioned by subdividing the unit into  0ths   0ths and   0ths as the  00 english do and as we have done and the ease of subdivision in a decimal ratio the same difference arises in making payment an englishman to pay £    s   d  –  qrs must find by calculation what combination of the coins of his country will pay this sum but an american having the same sum to pay thus expressed      will know by inspection only that three golden pieces eight units or dollars six tenths and five coppers pay it precisely iii the third condition required is that the unit its multiples and subdivisions coincide in value with some of the known coins so nearly that the people may by a quick reference in the mind estimate their value if this be not attended to they will be very long in adopting the innovation if ever they adopt it let us examine in this point of view each of the four coins proposed   the golden piece will be  –  more than a half joe and  –   more than a double guinea it will be readily estimated then by reference to either of them but more readily and accurately as equal to ten dollars   the unit or dollar is a known coin and the most familiar of all to the minds of the people it is already adopted from south to north has identified our currency and therefore happily offers itself as a unit already introduced our public debt our requisitions and their appointments have given it actual and long possession of the place of unit the course of our commerce too will bring us more of this than of any other foreign coin and therefore  0  renders it more worthy of attention i know of no unit which can be proposed in competition with the dollar but the pound but what is the pound      grains of fine silver in georgia      grains in virginia connecticut rhode island massachusetts and new hampshire  0    –  grains in maryland delaware pennsylvania and new jersey      –  grains in north carolina and new york which of these shall we adopt to which state give that preeminence of which all are so jealous and on which impose the difficulties of a new estimate of their corn their cattle and other commodities or shall we hang the pound sterling as a common badge about all their necks this contains       –  grains of pure silver it is difficult to familiarize a new coin to the people it is more difficult to familiarize them to a new coin with an old name happily the dollar is familiar to them all and is already as much referred to for a measure of value as their respective provincial pounds   the tenth will be precisely the spanish bit or half pistereen this is a coin perfectly familiar to us all when we shall make a new coin then equal in value to this it will be of ready estimate with the people   the hundredth or copper will differ little from the copper of the four eastern states which is  – 0  of a dollar still less from the penny of new york and north carolina which is  –   of a dollar and somewhat more than the penny or copper of jersey pennsylvania delaware and maryland which is  – 0 of a dollar it will be about the  0  medium between the old and the new coppers of these states and will therefore soon be substituted for them both in virginia coppers have never been in use it will be as easy therefore to introduce them there of one value as of another the copper coin proposed will be nearly equal to threefourths of their penny which is the same with the penny lawful of the eastern states a great deal of small change is useful in a state and tends to reduce the price of small articles perhaps it would not be amiss to coin three more pieces of silver one of the value of fivetenths or half a dollar one of the value of twotenths which would be equal to the spanish pistereen and one of the value of five coppers which would be equal to the spanish halfbit we should then have five silver coins viz   the unit or dollar   the half dollar or fivetenths   the double tenth equal to   or onefifth of a dollar or to the pistereen   the tenth equal to a spanish bit   the five copper piece equal to   or onetwentieth of a dollar or the halfbit the plan reported by the financier is worthy of his sound judgment it admits however of objection in the size of the unit he proposes that this shall be the    0th part of a dollar so that it will require    0 of his units to make the one before proposed he was led to adopt this by a mathematical attention to our old currencies all of which this unit will measure without leaving a fraction but  0  as our object is to get rid of those currencies the advantage derived from this coincidence will soon be past whereas the inconveniencies of this unit will forever remain if they do not altogether prevent its introduction it is defective in two of the three requisites of a money unit   it is inconvenient in its application to the ordinary money transactions  0000 dollars will require eight figures to express them to wit    00000 units a horse or bullock of eighty dollars value will require a notation of six figures to wit     00 units as a money of account this will be laborious even when facilitated by the aid of decimal arithmetic as a common measure of the value of property it will be too minute to be comprehended by the people the french are subjected to very laborious calculations the livre being their ordinary money of account and this but between  – th and  – th of a dollar but what will be our labors should our money of account be  –   0th of a dollar   it is neither equal nor near to any of the known coins in value if we determine that a dollar shall be our unit we must then say with precision what a dollar is this coin struck at different times of different weights and fineness is of different values sir isaac newtons assay and representation to the lords of the treasury in      of those which he examined make their values as follows  dwts grs the seville piece of eight   –   containing     grains of pure silver the mexico piece of eight   – 0  –  containing      –  the pillar piece of eight   –  containing      –  the new seville piece of eight   — containing  0   – 0  0  the financier states the old dollar as containing     grains of fine silver and the new     grains if the dollars circulating among us be of every date equally we should examine the quantity of pure metal in each and from them form an average for our unit this is a work proper to be committed to mathematicians as well as merchants and which should be decided on actual and accurate experiment the quantum of alloy is also to be decided some is necessary to prevent the coin from wearing too fast too much fills our pockets with copper instead of silver the silver coin assayed by sir isaac newton varied from    –  to    pennyweights alloy in the pound troy of mixed metal the british standard has    dwt the spanish coins assayed by sir isaac newton have from    to     –  dwt the new french crown has in fact     –  though by edict it should have  0 dwt that is  –   the taste of our countrymen will require that their furniture plate should be as good as the british standard taste cannot be controlled by law let it then give the law in a point which is indifferent to a certain degree let the legislature fix the alloy of furniture plate at    dwt the british standard and congress that of their coin at one ounce in the pound the french standard this proportion has been found convenient for the alloy of gold coin and it will simplify the system of our mint to alloy both metals in the same degree the coin too being the least pure will be the less easily melted into plate these reasons are light indeed and of course will  0  only weigh if no heavier ones can be opposed to them the proportion between the values of gold and silver is a mercantile problem altogether it would be inaccurate to fix it by the popular exchanges of a half joe for eight dollars a louis for four french crowns or five louis for twentythree dollars the first of these would be about the spanish proportion between gold and silver the second the french the third a mere popular barter wherein convenience is consulted more than accuracy the legal proportion in spain is    for   in england     –  for   in france    for   the spaniards and english are found in experience to retain an overproportion of gold coins and to lose their silver the french have a greater proportion of silver the difference at market has been on the decrease the financier states it at present as at     –  for one just principles will lead us to disregard legal proportions altogether to enquire into the market price of gold in the several countries with which we shall principally be connected in commerce and to take an average from them perhaps we might with safety lean to a proportion somewhat above par for gold considering our neighborhood and commerce with the sources of the coins and the tendency which the high price of gold in spain has to draw thither all that of their mines leaving silver principally for our and other markets it is not impossible that    for   may be found an eligible proportion i state it however as a conjecture only as to the alloy for gold coin the british is an  0  ounce in the pound the french spanish and portuguese differ from that only from a quarter of a grain to a grain and a half i should therefore prefer the british merely because its fraction stands in a more simple form and facilitates the calculations into which it enters should the unit be fixed at     grains of pure silver gold at    for   and the alloy of both be onetwelfth the weight of the coins will be as follows  grains grains dwt grains the golden piece containing      –  of pure metal      of alloy will weigh   —    the unit or dollar            —     the half dollar or five tenths      –        — 0  the fifth or pistereen         —    the tenth or bit     –        —      the twentieth or half bit     –           the quantity of fine silver which shall constitute the unit being settled and the proportion of the value of gold to that of silver a table should be formed from the assay before suggested classing the several foreign coins according to their fineness declaring the worth of a pennyweight or grain in each class and that they shall be lawful tenders at those rates if not clipped or otherwise diminished and where diminished offering their value for them at the mint deducting the expense of recoinage here the legislatures should cooperate with congress in providing that no money be received or paid at their treasuries or by any of their officers or any bank but on actual weight in making it criminal in a high degree to diminish their own coins and in some smaller degree to offer them in payment when diminished  0  that this subject may be properly prepared and in readiness for congress to take up at their meeting in november something must now be done the present session drawing to a close they probably would not choose to enter far into this undertaking themselves the committee of the states however during the recess will have time to digest it thoroughly if congress will fix some general principles for their government suppose they be instructed to appoint proper persons to assay and examine with the utmost accuracy practicable the spanish milled dollars of different dates in circulation with us to assay and examine in like manner the fineness of all the other coins which may be found in circulation within these states to report to the committee the result of these assays by them to be laid before congress to appoint also proper persons to enquire what are the proportions between the values of fine gold and fine silver at the markets of the several countries with which we are or probably may be connected in commerce and what would be a proper proportion here having regard to the average of their values at those markets and to other circumstances and to report the same to the committee by them to be laid before congress to prepare an ordinance for establishing the unit of money within these states for subdividing it and for striking coins of gold silver and copper on the following principles  0  that the money unit of these states shall be equal in value to a spanish milled dollar containing so much fine silver as the assay before directed shall show to be contained on an average in dollars of the several dates in circulation with us that this unit shall be divided into tenths and hundredths that there shall be a coin of silver of the value of a unit one other of the same metal of the value of onetenth of a unit one other of copper of the value of the hundredth of a unit that there shall be a coin of gold of the value of ten units according to the report before directed and the judgment of the committee thereon that the alloy of the said coins of gold and silver shall be equal in weight to oneeleventh part of the fine metal that there be proper devices for these coins that measures be proposed for preventing their diminution and also their currency and that of any others when diminished that the several foreign coins be described and classed in the said ordinance the fineness of each class stated and its value by weight estimated in units and decimal parts of units and that the said draught of an ordinance be reported to congress at their next meeting for their consideration and determination thomas jefferson april      april      supplementary explanations the preceding notes having been submitted to the consideration of the financier he favored me with  0  his opinion and observations on them which render necessary the following supplementary explanations i observed in the preceding notes that the true proportion of value between gold and silver was a mercantile problem altogether and that perhaps fifteen for one might be found an eligible proportion the financier is so good as to inform me that this would be higher than the market would justify confident of his better information on this subject i recede from that idea  he also informs me that the several coins in circulation among us have been already assayed with accuracy and the result published in a work on that subject the assay of sir isaac newton had superseded in my mind the necessity of this operation as to the older coins which were the subject of his examination this latter work with equal reason may be considered as saving the same trouble as to the latter coins so far then i accede to the opinions of the financier on the other hand he seems to concur with me in thinking his smallest fractional division too minute for a unit and therefore proposes to transfer that denomination to his largest silver coin containing  000 of the units first proposed and worth about  s  d lawful or   –   of a dollar the only question then remaining between us is whether the   0 dollar or this coin be best for the unit we both agree that the ease of adoption with the people is the thing to be aimed at   as to the dollar events have overtaken and superseded the question it is no longer a doubt whether the people can adopt it with ease they have adopted it and will have to be turned out of that into another tract of calculation if another unit be assumed they have now two units which they use with equal facility viz the pound of their respective state and the dollar the first of these is peculiar to each state the second happily common to all in each state the people have an easy rule of converting the pound of their state into dollars or dollars into pounds and this is enough for them without knowing how this may be done in every state of the union such of them as live near enough the borders of their state to have dealings with their neighbors learn also the rule of their neighbors thus in virginia and the eastern states where the dollar is  s or  – 0 of a pound to turn pounds into dollars they multiply by  0 and divide by   to turn dollars into pounds they multiply by   and divide by  0 those in virginia who live near to carolina where the dollar is  s or  – 0 of a pound learn the operation of that state which is a multiplication by   and division by  0 et e converso those who live near maryland where the dollar is  s  d or  –  of a pound multiply by   and divide by   et e converso all these operations are easy and have been found by experience not too much for the arithmetic of the people when     they have occasion to convert their old unit into dollars or the reverse   as to the unit of the financier in the states where the dollar is  – 0 of a pound this unit will be  –   its conversion into the pound then will be by a multiplication of   and a division by    in the states where the dollar is  –  of a pound this unit will be   –   of a pound and the operation must be to multiply by    and divide by    et e converso where the dollar is  – 0 of a pound this unit will be  –   the simplicity of the fraction and of course the facility of conversion and reconversion is therefore against this unit and in favor of the dollar in every instance the only advantage it has over the dollar is that it will in every case express our farthing without a remainder whereas though the dollar and its decimals will do this in many cases it will not in all but even in these by extending your notation one figure further to wit to thousands you approximate to perfect accuracy within less than the twothousandth part of a dollar an atom in money which every one would neglect against this single inconvenience the other advantages of the dollar are more than sufficient to preponderate this unit will present to the people a new coin and whether they endeavor to estimate its value by comparing it with a pound or with a dollar the units they now possess they will find the fraction very compound and of course less accommodated to their comprehension and habits than the dollar indeed the probability is that they could never be led to compute in it generally     the financier supposes that the  – 00 part of a dollar is not sufficiently small where the poor are purchasers or vendors if it is not make a smaller coin but i suspect that it is small enough let us examine facts in countries where we are acquainted with them in virginia where our towns are few small and of course their demand for necessaries very limited we have never yet been able to introduce a copper coin at all the smallest coin which anybody will receive there is the halfbit or  – 0 of a dollar in those states where the towns are larger and more populous a more habitual barter of small wants has called for a copper coin of  – 0  –   or  – 0  of a dollar in england where the towns are many and populous and where ages of experience have matured the conveniences of intercourse they have found that some wants may be supplied for a farthing or  – 0  of a dollar and they have accommodated a coin to this want this business is evidently progressive in virginia we are far behind in some other states they are further advanced to wit to the appreciation of  – 0  –    – 0  of a dollar to this most advanced state then i accommodated my smallest coin in the decimal arrangement as a money of payment corresponding with the money of account i have no doubt the time will come when a smaller coin will be called for when that comes let it be made it will probably be the half of the copper i suppose that is to say  – 000 or 00  of a dollar this being very nearly the farthing of england but it will be time enough to make it when the people shall be ready to receive it     my proposition then is that our notation of money shall be decimal descending ad libitum of the person noting that the unit of this notation shall be a dollar that coins shall be accommodated to it from ten dollars to the hundredth of a dollar and that to set this on foot the resolutions be adopted which were proposed in the notes only substituting an inquiry into the fineness of the coins in lieu of

place where they may be sitting with such privileges and exemptions immunities as will leave them in cover them from molestation and disturbance and leave them in freedom  tranquility to apply their whole time and attention to the objects of their delegation   that territory and exclusive jurisdiction in  about the place of their session is not necessary to attain these ends and would subject them to avocations from their proper objects   that the legations which have been practised among long experience has led the civilized nations of europe have led to a long course of experience to an ascertainment of those privileges and immunities which are necessary for the free exercise of their functions which may enable the representative of an independent nation exercising high functions

it is interesting and so far as you have stood connected with it has been matter of anxiety to me because whatever may be the ultimate fate of the institution of the cincinnati as in its course it draws to it some degree of disapprobation i have wished to see you standing on ground separated from it and that the character which will be handed to future ages at the head of our revolution may in no instance be compromitted in subordinate altercations the subject has been at the     point of my pen in every letter i have written to you but has been still restrained by the reflection that you had among your friends more able counsellors and in yourself one abler than them all your letter has now rendered a duty what was before a desire and i cannot better merit your confidence than by a full and free communication of facts  sentiments as far as they have come within my observation when the army was about to be disbanded  the officers to take final leave perhaps never again to meet it was natural for men who had accompanied each other thro so many scenes of hardship of difficulty and danger who in a variety of instances must have been rendered mutually dear by those aids  good offices to which their situations had given occasion it was natural i say for these to seize with fondness any proposition which promised to bring them together again at certain  regular periods and this i take for granted was the origin  object of this institution  i have no suspicion that they foresaw much less intended those mischiefs which exist perhaps in the forebodings of politicians only i doubt however whether in its execution it would be found to answer the wishes of those who framed it and to foster those friendships it was intended to preserve the members would be brought together at their annual assemblies no longer to encounter a common enemy but to encounter one another in debate  sentiment for something i suppose is to be done at these meetings  however unimportant it will suffice to produce difference of opinion contradiction  irritation     the way to make friends quarrel is to put them in disputation under the public eye an experience of near twenty years has taught me that few friendships stand this test  that public assemblies where every one is free to act  speak are the most powerful looseners of the bands of private friendship i think therefore that this institution would fail in its principal object the perpetuation of the personal friendships contracted thro the war the objections of those who are opposed to the institution shall be briefly sketched you will readily fill them up they urge that it is against the confederation—against the letter of some of our constitutions—against the spirit of all of them—that the foundation on which all these are built is the natural equality of man the denial of every preeminence but that annexed to legal office  particularly the denial of a preeminence by birth that however in their present dispositions citizens might decline accepting honorary instalments into the order a time may come when a change of dispositions would render these flattering when a well directed distribution of them might draw into the order all the men of talents of office  wealth and in this case would probably procure an ingraftment into the government that in this they will be supported by their foreign members  the wishes  influence of foreign courts that experience has shewn that the hereditary branches of modern governments are the patrons of privilege  prerogative  not of the natural rights of the people whose oppressors they generally are that besides these evils     which are remote others may take place more immediately that a distinction is kept up between the civil  military which it is for the happiness of both to obliterate that when the members assemble they will be proposing to do something  what that something may be will depend on actual circumstances that being an organized body under habits of subordination the first obstructions to enterprize will be already surmounted that the moderation  virtue of a single character has probably prevented this revolution from being closed as most others have been by a subversion of that liberty it was intended to establish that he is not immortal  his successor or some of his successors may be led by false calculation into a less certain road to glory what are the sentiments of congress on this subject  what line will they pursue can only be stated conjecturally congress as a body if left to themselves will in my opinion say nothing on the subject they may however be forced into a declaration by instructions from some of the states or by other incidents their sentiments if forced from them will be unfriendly to the institution if permitted to pursue their own path they will check it by side blows whenever it comes in their way  in competitions for office on equal or nearly equal ground will give silent preferences to those who are not of the fraternity my reasons for thinking this are   the grounds on which they lately declined the foreign order proposed to be conferred on some of our citizens   the fourth of the fundamental articles of constitution for the new states i inclose     you the report it has been considered by congress recommitted  reformed by a committee according to sentiments expressed on other parts of it but the principle referred to having not been controverted at all stands in this as in the original report it is not yet confirmed by congress   private conversations on this subject with the members since the receipt of your letter i have taken occasion to extend these not indeed to the military members because being of the order delicacy forbade it but to the others pretty generally and among these i have as yet found but one who is not opposed to the institution  that with an anguish of mind tho covered under a guarded silence which i have not seen produced by any circumstance before i arrived at philadelphia before the separation of the last congress  saw there  at princetown some of its members not now in delegation burkes piece happened to come out at that time which occasioned this institution to be the subject of conversation i found the same impressions made on them which their successors have received i hear from other quarters that it is disagreeable generally to such citizens as have attended to it  therefore will probably be so to all when any circumstance shall present it to the notice of all this sir is as faithful an account of sentiments  facts as i am able to give you you know the extent of the circle within which my observations are at present circumscribed  can estimate how far as forming a part of the general opinion it may merit notice or ought to influence your particular conduct     it remains now to pay obedience to that part of your letter which requests sentiments on the most eligible measures to be pursued by the society at their next meeting i must be far from pretending to be a judge of what would in fact be the most eligible measures for the society i can only give you the opinions of those with whom i have conversed  who as i have before observed are unfriendly to it they lead to these conclusions   if the society proceeds according to its institution it will be better to make no applications to congress on that subject or any other in their associated character   if they should propose to modify it so as to render it unobjectionable i think this would not be effected without such a modification as would amount almost to annihilation for such would it be to part with its inheritability its organization  its assemblies   if they shall be disposed to discontinue the whole it would remain with them to determine whether they would chuse it to be done by their own act only or by a reference of the matter to congress which would infallibly produce a recommendation of total discontinuance you will be sensible sir that these communications are without all reserve i supposed such to be your wish  mean them but as materials with such others as you may collect for your better judgment to work on i consider the whole matter as between ourselves alone having determined to take no active part in this or anything else which may lead to altercation or disturb that quiet      tranquillity of mind to which i consign the remaining portion of my life i have been thrown back by events on a stage where i had never more thought to appear it is but for a time however  as a day labourer free to withdraw or be withdrawn at will while i remain i shall pursue in silence the path of right but in every situation public or private i shall be gratified by all occasions of rendering you service  of convincing you there is no one to whom your reputation  happiness are dearer thomas jefferson april         annapolis james madison to james madison annapolis april         dear sir —my last to you on the   th of march as was the latest i have received from you by the proposition to bound our country to the westward i meant no more than the passing an act declaring that that should be our boundary from the moment that the people of the western country  congress should agree to it the act of congress now inclosed to you will shew you that they have agreed to it because it extends not only to the territory ceded but to be ceded and shews how and when they shall be taken into the union there is nobody then to consult but the people to be severed if you will make your act final as to yourselves as soon as those people shall have declared their assent in a certain manner to be pointed out by the act the whole business is settled for their assent will follow immediately one of the conditions is that they pay their quota of the contracted of course   0 no difficulty need arise on this head as no quota has been fixed on us unalterably the minuter circumstances of selling the ungranted lands will be provided in an ordinance already prepared but not reported you will observe two clauses struck out of the report the  st respecting hereditary honors the second slavery the  st was done not from an approbation of such honors but because it was thought an improper place to encounter them the  nd was lost by an individual vote only ten states were present the   eastern states n york and penns were for the clause jersey would have been for it but there were but two members one of whom was sick in his chambers south carolina maryland and virginia voted against it n carolina was divided as would have been virginia had not one of its delegates been sick in bed the place at which congress should meet in nov has been the subject of discussion lately alexandria philadelphia  trenton were proposed the first was negatived easily trenton had the   eastern states n y n j  penns we expect georgia  delaware shortly in which case it will become possible that phila may be determined on the question is put off to be considered with the establishment of a com of the states which to my astonishment would have been negatived when first proposed had not the question been staved off some of the states who were against the measure i believe because they had never reflected on the consequences of leaving a government without a head seem to be come over     dr lee is appointed an indian com he is not present but is known to have sought it  of course will accept this vacates his seat here i wish short could be sent in his room it is a good school for our young statesmen it gives them impressions friendly to the federal government instead of those adverse which too often take place in persons confined to the politics of their state i like the method you propose of settling at once with maryland all matters relative to potowmac to introduce this more easily i have conversed with mr stone one of their delegates on the subject  finding him of the same opinion have told him i would by letters bring the subject forward on our part they will consider it therefore as originated by this conversation mercer is  0  ing a very   0 or     part he is a candidate for the     secretary ship of foreign     affairs and tho he will not get the vote of one state i believe he expects the appointment he has been endeavoring to

passed in the detail one of the eastern states had their laws revised and then attempted to pass them through their legislature but they got so mangled that all consistence was destroyed  i believe they dropped them altogether should this be printed i will ask you to send me half a dozen copies wherever i shall be would it not be well for virginia to empower persons privately to buy up her quota of old continental money i would certainly advise this were i not afraid that the possession of her quota on such easy terms would tempt her to refuse justice to the other states on this matter for surely there would be no justice in wiping off her part of this debt by so much smaller a contribution than the others if she would avail herself of it only to shield herself against injustice and to enable her from a high ground to declare  do what is right i should much wish to see her adopt secret measures for the purchase i think some other states will do thus  fear with unjust     views you know that many gentlemen of this state had money in the hands of merchants in england i am well informed that these merchants have uniformly refused to pay them interest saying the money was always ready if they would have called for it this adds another to the many good reasons we had before against paying interest during the war    congress hope to adjourn by the last of may the estimate and

like manner due north  south and others crossing these at right angles for laying off the said territory surveyors shall be appointed by congress or the committee of the states who shall proceed

inclosing you an act of congress on the subject of western territory as passed a few days ago the ordinance for opening the land office so soon as our purchases are made from the indians is not yet passed i also inclose a copy of the estimate  requisitions of the year as they passed congress this however you will shortly receive from the president officially congress have determined that they will adjourn on the  d of june to meet at trenton in november virginia maryland  pennsylvania gave each certain powers to congress to enable them to counteract the british commercial measures but these powers were all different a recommendation is therefore now under consideration proposing to the states to give a uniform     power for a given term of years which may enable congress to make it the interest of every nation to enter into equal treaties with us this i think will be ready by the next post the chevalr luzerne has notafied his leave to return home  that monsr de marbois will act as chargé des affaires till a successor arrives we begin to hope that the bills of the financier threatened with protest have been taken up the ground of our hope is the length of time elapsed without hearing of their ultimate protest a vessel arrived here two days ago which left london the   th of march she brings papers to the  0th pitt was still in place supported by the king h of lords the city of london e india company  the nation in general who were sending addresses from all parts of the crown in his favor the grocers company having presented him with the freedom of their body  given him an entertainment the city was illuminated and the windows of the opposition who would not illuminate were broken still the opposition returned a majority of    in the h of commons who kept all the wheels of government suspended it was in mr pitts power to secure himself at any time by admitting a coalition but this would seem to shift him on the very ground which had shaken his adversaries it was believed that parliament would be dissolved they had continued the kings power over our commerce six months longer     thomas jefferson may        annapolis horatio gates to horatio gates  annapolis may  th      dear general —i received by the last post your favor of the   th ult and am obliged for the communication therein the ferment on the subject of your society seems just becoming general they write us from virginia that it works high there and that the division is precisely into civil and military we will not presume to send foreign news from annapolis to philadelphia congress expects to adjourn on the  d of june they have passed the estimate and requisitions for the year and some recommendations to the states to vest congress with such much power over their commerce as will enable them to retaliate on any nation who may wish to grasp it on unequal terms and to enable them if it should be found expedient to pass something like the british navigation act you say sic in the public papers a report of a committee erroneously said to be an act of congress for dividing the western country into new states that report was recommitted the paragraphs of names struck off the principles of government somewhat varied  the act then passed foreign treaties of commerce occupy us at present i am not yet fixed as to the time of my coming to philadelphia tho think it will not

th of october      relative to the continental bills of credit of the old emissions submit the following resolved that all sums of continental bills of credit paid by or to any state on account of the united states shall be credited or debited in account according to the specie value of such bills at the time of paiment as settled by the legislature of the same state in their table of depreciation formed for the use of their state and where none such has been formed an average shall be taken from those of the states adjoining wherein such tables have been formed on which paiments an interest shall be allowed at the rate of   per centum per annum from the time of paiment that all such bills now in the treasury of any state shall be credited to such state at the value they bore in specie at the time they were received by the state which value shall be settled by a table of depreciation as directed in the preceding resolution for     all the period of time comprehended in such depreciation table and if the sd bills were received after the last day to which such table descends they shall then be credited at the rate at which they were actually purchased or received or if not purchased or received at any particular rate then at the market value of such bills within the state at the time to be estimated on the best evidence which may be obtained on which sums also a like interest of   per cent per annum from the time of receipt shall be allowed and the affidavit of the treasurer receiving the sd bills shall be evidence of the time and rate at which they were received that all such bills now in the hands of individuals shall be redeemed at the same rates prescribed for those in the treasury of their state that the holders of such bills shall be at liberty to carry them to the loan officer of the u s within their state who shall give them in exchange for the same a certificate expressing the sum in specie which the u s owe in lieu thereof  the time from which it bears interest which time shall be the  st day of april      where the sd bills were received before that day  when received afterwards the time of their actual receipt the loan officer shall require from the holder the best evidence of the time of his receiving them which the nature of the case will admit viz that of circumstances  disinterested persons where to be had and where not to be had to his satisfaction then resorting to the examination of the party himself on oath  giving thereto so much credit as in his conscience he shall think it deserves and in   0 all cases of importance  difficulty shall associate to himself two honest  able persons to assist him in the examination  judgment these certificates shall be funded  paid as the other debts of the u s but no certificate shall be issued for a less sum than twenty specie dollars that the superintendent of finance direct the form  mode of issuing the aforesd certificates  take order for destroying the continental bills

correspondence for the month being devolved on me and no authentic intelligence from abroad having been received i have it in my power to communicate to you only what we get through the channel of the public papers the inclosed will present to you some of the late debates of the h of commons their address to the king  his answers these seem to exclude the prospect of accomodation in my last i inclosed you a copy of the estimate  requisitions for the year and the act for the division of the western territories as they had ultimately passed congress since that the resolutions have been passed which have been forwarded to you by the president recommending to the legislatures to invest congress with certain powers in some cases of commerce the principles on which     treaties of commerce are to be formed with foreign powers occupy the attention of congress at this time these will then remain for discussion before their adjournment   the opening of their land office   indian affairs   the western posts   a proposed arrangement of the treasury on the resignation of mr morris is expected    a definition of the powers of the committee of the states in your favour of the   d of apr you ask at what rate the loanoffice debt is to be discharged the resolutions of june       0 which fix the rate of depreciation declare that the principal of the loans shall be discharged in spanish dollars according to those rates we have had information of the adoption of the impost by every state except georgia n carolina new york connecticut  rhode island from the three first there is no reason to apprehend any opposition connecticut declares itself opposed unless the commutation can be separated from it the firmness of congress on this head will exclude her from every hope of that and i am informed it is probable she will yield that point  adopt the measure i have frequently heard the gentleman of rhode island to whom the opposition of that state has been generally imputed declare that rhode island would never come into the measure of the impost as long as any other state would hold off that if every other acceded however she would not solely oppose the will of the whole union but in that case would yield the probability is therefore that the     measure will get through all the legislatures in the course of this summer thomas jefferson may        annapolis benjamin harrison to the governor of virginia benjamin harrison v s a annapolis may        sir —since my letter of this morning the post has arrived and brought us a letter from dr franklin of mar   he had received a letter from congress informing him of the reasons of delaying our ratification he apprehends no difficulty from this circumstance  the rather as he had received a letter from mr hartley dated mar   the day before the exchange should have taken place desiring him he would inform him when the american ratification should arrive  he would then apply for the british  attend the exchange letters this moment received from holland inform us that the protested bills will be taken up but by pushing a plan of loan on terms most ruinous and disgraceful yet less so than nonpaiment would have been this shows the necessity of doing something effectual in the business of supplies p s mr hardy desires me to present his compliments and to inform you that the want of anything material to be added to the intelligence i have communicated prevents him troubling you with a letter     thomas jefferson may 0       instructions to the ministers plenipotentiary appointed to negotiate treaties of commerce with the european nations  may        whereas instructions bearing date the   th day of october      were sent to the ministers plenipotentiary of the united states of america at the court of versailles empowered to negotiate a peace or to any one or more of them for concerting drafts or propositions for treaties of amity and commerce with the commercial powers of europe resolved that it will be advantageous to these united states to conclude such treaties with russia the court of vienna prussia denmark saxony hamburg great britain spain portugal genoa tuscany rome naples venice sardinia and the ottoman porte resolved that in the formation of these treaties the following points be carefully stipulated  st that each party shall have a right to carry their own produce manufactures and merchandise in their own bottoms to the ports of the other and thence the produce and merchandise of the other paying in both cases such duties only as are paid by the most favored nation freely where it is freely granted to such nation or paying the compensation where such nation does the same   that with the nations holding territorial possessions in america a direct and similar intercourse be admitted between the united states and such possessions or if this cannot be obtained then a     direct and similar intercourse between the united states and certain free ports within such possessions that if this neither can be obtained permission be stipulated to bring from such possessions in their own bottoms the produce and merchandise thereof to their states directly and for these states to carry in their own bottoms their produce and merchandise to such possessions directly   that these united states be considered in all such treaties and in every case arising under them as one nation upon the principles of the federal constitution   that it be proposed though not indispensably required that if war should hereafter arise between the two contracting parties the merchants of either country then residing in the other shall be allowed to remain nine months to collect their debts and settle their affairs and may depart freely carrying off all their effects without molestation or hinderance and all fishermen all cultivators of the earth and all artisans or manufacturers unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns villages or places who labor for the common subsistence and benefit of mankind and peaceably following their respective employments shall be allowed to continue the same and shall not be molested by the armed force of the enemy in whose power by the events of war they may happen to fall but if anything is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such armed force the same shall be paid for at a reasonable price and all merchants and traders exchanging the products of different places and thereby rendering the     necessaries conveniences and comforts of human life more easy to obtain and more general shall be allowed to pass free and unmolested and neither of the contracting powers shall grant or issue any commission to any private armed vessels empowering them to take or destroy such trading ships or interrupt such commerce   and in case either of the contracting parties shall happen to be engaged in war with any other nation it be further agreed in order to prevent all the difficulties and misunderstandings that usually arise respecting the merchandise heretofore called contraband such as arms ammunition and military stores of all kinds that no such articles carrying by the ships or subjects of one of the parties to the enemies of the other shall on any account be deemed contraband so as to induce confiscation and a loss of property to individuals nevertheless it shall be lawful to stop such ships and detain them for such length of time as the captors may think necessary to prevent the inconvenience or damage that might ensue from their proceeding on their voyage paying however a reasonable compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the proprietors and it shall be further allowed to use in the service of the captors the whole or any part of the military stores so detained paying the owners the full value of the same to be ascertained by the current price at the place of its destination but if the other contracting party will not consent to discontinue the confiscation of contraband goods then that it be stipulated that if the master of the vessel stopped     will deliver out the goods charged to be contraband he shall be admitted to do it and the vessel shall not in that case be carried into any port but shall be allowed to proceed on her voyage   that in the same case when either of the contracting parties shall happen to be engaged in war with any other power all goods not contraband belonging to the subjects of that other power and shipped in the bottoms of the party hereto who is not engaged in the war shall be entirely free and that to ascertain what shall constitute the blockade of any place or port it shall be understood to be in such predicament when the assailing power shall have taken such a station as to expose to imminent danger any ship or ships that would attempt to sail in or out of the said port and that no vessel of the party who is not engaged in the said war shall be stopped without a material and wellgrounded cause and in such cases justice shall be done and an indemnification given without loss of time to the persons aggrieved and thus stopped without sufficient cause   that no right be stipulated for aliens to hold real property within these states this being utterly inadmissible by their several laws and policy but when on the death of any person holding real estate within the territories of one of the contracting parties such real estate would by their laws descend on a subject or citizen of the other were he not disqualified by alienage then he shall be allowed reasonable time to dispose of the same and withdraw the proceeds without molestation       that such treaties be made for a term not exceeding ten years from the exchange of ratification   that these instructions be considered as supplementary to those of october   th      and not as revoking except when they contradict them that where in treaty with a particular nation they can procure particular advantages to the specification of which we have been unable to descend our object in these instructions having been to form outlines only and general principles of treaty with many nations it is our expectation they will procure them though not pointed out in these instructions and where they may be able to form treaties on principles which in their judgment will be more beneficial to the united states than those herein directed to be made their basis they are permitted to adopt such principles that as to the duration of treaties though we have proposed to restrain them to the term of ten years yet they are at liberty to extend the same as far as fifteen years with any nation which may pertinaciously insist thereon and that it will be agreeable to us to have supplementary treaties with france the united netherlands and sweden which may bring the treaties we have entered into with them as nearly as may be to the principles of those now directed but that this be not pressed if the proposal should be found disagreeable resolved that the treaties of amity or of amity and commerce be entered into with morocco and the regencies of algiers tunis and tripoli to continue for the same term of ten years or for a term as much longer as can be procured     that our ministers to be commissioned for treating with foreign nations make known to the emperor of morocco the great satisfaction which congress feel from the amicable disposition he has shown towards these states and his readiness to enter into alliance with them that the occupations of the war and distance to our situation have prevented our meeting his friendship so early as we wished but the powers are now delegated to them for entering into treaty with him in the execution of which they are ready to proceed and that as to the expenses of his minister they do therein what is for the honor and interest of the united states resolved that a commission be issued to mr j adams mr b franklin and mr t jefferson giving powers to them or the greater part of them to make and receive propositions for such treaties of amity and commerce and to negotiate and sign the same transmitting them to congress for their final ratification and that such commission be in force for a term not exceeding two years thomas jefferson may         philadelphia james monroe to james monroe mon mss philadelphia may         dear sir —your favor of the   th came duly to hand it enabled me to give to col humphries the first intimation of his appointment and to see that he received real pleasure from it he was before unknown to me but our future connection in business has occasioned me to inquire into his character with which i am much pleased we have taken     arrangements for passing the atlantic together short is not yet arrived but had he not been coming the servant whom i ordered to join me here would have been with me before now i wait for time  for our commissions  instructions the moment these arrive i shall set out for boston where a passage will be provided—is there a commission for an additional treaty with france the instructions made this necessary and without it we shall be at paris but private citizens unprotected by the laws of nations and liable to the jurisdiction of the country a very disagreeable affair has happened here which will give you trouble probably both on this  the other side the water it is an assault by a very worthless frenchman on mr marbois for refusing to give the attestations of the consulate to some falsehoods which he wished to establish i mean to make myself acquainted with the affair  will write you particularly on it before i leave this place genl knox went on from hence two days ago to receive the orders of congress as to the western posts the mouth of the illinois is the interesting post for virginia because it will open a trade up the missouri  missisippi the spot there is advantageous for defence according to hutchins pamphlet  genl washingtons letter on the peace establishment michillimacinac is very important for the united states in general it is interesting to virginia on the expectation that she may open the navigation from lake erie to patowmac detroit is a place of consequence but so strongly settled that i doubt whether any force need be kept there the   0 n yorkers will wish a force at niagara or oswego i should yield to them as far as necessity requires but the further north that post is the better for virginia were it even pushed to the intersection of the cataraqui with the   th degree it might then leave a possibility of drawing the six nations to fpitt mr thomsons counsel on this subject will probably be useful the interests of pennsylva  virginia being united as to all these posts we shall not begin to scramble for the trade till we have brought it to f pitt to the southward it would be our interest to have an agency kept up with the overhill cherokees  martin the agent if s carola  georgia would then be contented with one other agency  could agree on its situation it would be well i had thought of the head of mobile river because there is a very short portage from there to the waters of the tenissee which would give us access to it but mr reid thought it too distant from the inhabited country i am to thank you for your care of my baggage which is come safely to hand mr hopkinson had sent on under cover to me a draught from mr morris for    ⅓ dollars for me and for the amount of mr hardys bill my part was intended for mr jenifer i hope you will have been so good as to dispose of both parts according to their destination boirod  gaillard had also forwarded by the stage some of the books you desired i have not yet received their bill  will transmit it to you as soon as received the stage having ceased to pass between baltimore  annapolis possibly these books may remain at the former place i believe there is     sometimes too a stoppage at susquehanna by a change of interest in the proprietors of the stage should this have happened your enquiries must come that far—i have had the pleasure of seeing three balons here the largest was of  f diameter  ascended about  00 feet i shall write to you again from this place  afterwards in the course of my northern progress i shall be obliged to you to continue your letters as long as they can reach boston by the   th of june a particular detail of congressional proceedings and of the communications from or concerning your foreign ministers will be most acceptable hopkinson tells me he had mentioned in his letter to me that the office of director or master of the mint would be acceptable he was therefore uneasy when i told him that i had left a request with a friend to open my letters but i satisfied him perfectly on that head and that you would render him any service which the duties of your situation would permit he is a man of genius gentility  great merit  at the same time poor  the father of a numerous family he holds a little office here more respectable than profitable for he can but barely live he is as capable of the office as any man i know  the appointment would give general pleasure because he is generally esteemed—messrs boirod  gaillard will be glad to receive the prospectus of the encyclopedia foreseeing that if i turn over the leaf i shall plague you with another page full i will here bid you adieu     thomas jefferson may         philadela charles thomson to charles thomson  philadela may         dear sir —i received your favor of the   th last night i was out when it was delivered so knew not how it came a circumstance no otherwise important than as i am at a loss how or where to inquire for the packet which should have accompanied it containing the commissions instructions etc i shall immediately however make the enquiry i am obliged to you for the order for the journal i shall make use of it to procure those of     –     and part of      which my set wants my matter in the printing way is dropped aitken had formerly told me he would print it for £  a sheet he now asks £   0s which raises the price from £   to £   but what was a more effectual and inseparable bar was that he could not complete it under three weeks a time i could not wait for it dunlap happened to be out of town so i relinquished the plan perhaps i may have a few copies struck off in paris if there be an english printer if i do you shall assuredly have one i shall take the liberty of adding some of your notes—those which were mendatory merely will have their effect on the body of the work i left all the papers belonging to the grand committee in the hands of mr blanchard among these were the papers relating to vermont my reason for not delivering them to you as i did the others was that the committee was to sit that morning there are vessels arrived here which left london as late as the    of april nothing important however has yet     been communicated from them the principal interesting occurrence here is a very daring insult committed on mr marbois by a frenchman who calls himself the cheval de longchamps but it is in fact the nephew of the ministers stewards wife he obliged him in his own defence to box in the street like a porter he is demanded by the minister to be delivered up by the executive here to be sent to france for punishment they are plodding over the case whether he be a citizen of america or not is not yet decided i shall endeavor to make myself acquainted with the facts because it will probably be the cause of something disagreeable here and perhaps on the other side of the water i think there is a desire in the executive to give every satisfaction they can but whether it is in the syllables and letters of the law that a frenchman committing an outrage may be delivered up to his master for punishment is matter of dubiety you will hear enough of it as it comes to congress of course so i will add no more than my respectful compliments to mrs thomson and assurances to yourself that i am with much esteem dr sir your friend and servant p s i find your letter came by post but no packet with it the arrival of so late a vessel is now contradicted thomas jefferson may         philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss philadelphia may         dear sir —   i could not get my notes printed here  therefore refer

our assembly to do something for him i think their quota of what ought to be given him would be  000 guineas or an inheritance with  00 guineas a year it would be peculiarly magnanimous in them to do it because it would shew that no particular  smaller passion has suppressed the grateful impressions which his services have made on our minds    i am obliged to put a period here to my letter being desired to assist in a consultation on a very disagreeable affair a frenchman of obscure  worthless character having applied to mr marbois to give him the consular attestations to a falsehood and being refused attacked him in the streets a day or two after and beat him much with his cane the minister has taken up this daring insult  violation of the law of nations in the person of the secretary to their embassy  demands him to be given up being a subject of france to be sent there for punishment i doubt whether the laws of this state have provided either to punish him sufficiently here or to surrender him to be punished by his own sovereign and the —  of this state is so indecisive that no defects of law will be supplied by any confidence of his in the justification of his assembly when they shall meet they have not yet declared what they can or will do  the scoundrel is going at large on bail sending anonymous letters to the minister  marbois with     threats of assassination c if the prosecution be not discontinued the affair is represented to congress who will have the will but not the power to interpose it will probably go next to france  bring on serious consequences for gods sake while this instance of the necessity of providing for the enforcement of the law of nations is fresh on mens minds introduce a bill which shall be effectual  satisfactory on this subject consuls you will always have ministers may pass occasionally through our country members of congress must pass through it should congress sit in or near the state frequent instances of these  public ministers entering the state may occur i wish you every possible felicity  shall hope to hear from you frequently thomas jefferson    june      boston benjamin franklin to benjamin franklin  boston    june      dear sir —supposing that congress would communicate to you directly the powers committed to yourself mr adams and myself i have delayed from day to day the honor of writing to you in hopes that every day would open to me a certainty of the time and place at which i might sail a french packet will leave new york early in the month by her i mean to take my passage and may therefore expect in the ordinary course of things to have the pleasure of joining you at paris in the middle or latter part of august and of communicating the commissions and     instructions under which we are to act the latter are more special than those heretofore sent i shall then also have the pleasure of giving you more particular information of the situation of our affairs than i could do by letter in general i may observe to you that their aspect is encouraging congress understanding that mr jay was probably on his passage to america appointed him their secretary for foreign affairs it would give me peculiar pleasure to meet with him before my departure and to know that he will act in an office with which we shall be so immediately connected congress adjourned on the  rd of june to meet at trenton on the first monday of november leaving a committee of the states at the helm during their recess i have the pleasure to inform you that mrs bache and her family were well when i left philadelphia which was about three weeks ago in hopes of joining you nearly as soon as you will receive this letter i subscribe myself with very sincere esteem and regard dear sir your most affectionate humble servant thomas jefferson july        boston james madison to james madison mad mss boston july        dear sir —after visiting the principal towns through connecticut rhode island this state  new hampshire in order to acquire what knowledge i could of their commerce and other circumstances i am returned to this place and shall sail the day after tomorrow in the ceres bound for london but my     purpose is to get on shore in some boat on the coast of france  proceed directly to paris my servant being sent off today  much on hand to prepare for my voyage i have no time for any particular communications indeed there are few i should have to make unless i were to enter into a detail which would be lengthy as to the country and people i have visited the lower house of this state have passed a bill giving congress the powers over their commerce which they had asked it had had two readings with the senate and meets with no opposition i find the conviction growing strongly that nothing can preserve our confederacy unless the band of union their common council be strengthened    thomas jefferson aug  0      paris benjamin harrison to the governor of virginia  benjamin harrison paris aug  0      sir —a few days after my arrival here colo le maire writer of the enclosed letter called  asked me to forward it to you with such explanations as i could give as to his commission having lost the original as he therein mentions he asks an authenticated copy of it which he thinks will enforce some application he is making to this government as to lands i remember the gift of  000 acres  think the entry of it will be found in the minutes of the council some time in the summer or autumn of      a letter was written to colo shelby or to maj martin     the cherokee agent to locate the warrant on the best lands possible and i believe it was meant that every expence should be borne by the state so that le maire should receive an actual grant clear of all charges  trouble but of these things the minutes  letters of the executive will give more certain information or if these should have been lost mr blair will probable recollect the circumstances thomas jefferson    november      paris james madison to james madison mad mss paris    november      i am obliged to you for your information as to the prospects of the present year in our farms it is a great satisfaction to know it  yet it is a circumstance which few correspondents think worthy of mention i am also much indebted for your very full observations on the navigation of the mississippi i had thought on the subject  sketched the anatomy of a memorial on it which will be much aided by your communications—you mention that my name is used by some speculators in western land jobbing as if they were acting for me as well as for themselves about the year      or      i consented to join mr harvey and some others in an application for lands there which scheme however i believe he dropped on the threshold for i never after heard one syllable on the subject in      i joined some gentlemen in a project to obtain some lands in the western part of north carolina but in the winter of      and      while i was in expectation     of going to europe and that the title to western lands might possibly come under the discussion of the ministers i withdrew myself from this company i am further assured that the members never prosecuted their views these were the only occasions in which i ever took a single step for the acquisition of western lands  in these i retracted at the threshold i can with truth therefore declare to you  wish you to repeat it on every proper occasion that no person on earth is authorized to place my name in any adventure for lands on the western waters that i am not engaged in any but the two before mentioned i am one of eight children to whom my father left his share in the loyal company whose interests however i never espoused and they have long since received their quietus excepting these i never was nor am i now interested in one foot of land on earth off the waters of james river i shall subjoin the few books i have ventured to buy for you i have been induced to do it by the combined circumstances of their utility and cheapness i wish i had a catalogue of the books you would be willing to buy because they are often to be met on stalls very cheap and i would get them as occasion should arise the subscription for the encyclopædia is still open whenever an opportunity offers of sending you what is published of that work    vols i shall subscribe for you and send it with the other books purchased for you whatever money i may lay out for you here in books or in anything else which you may desire may   0 be replaced crown for crown without bewildering ourselves in the exchange in virginia by making payments    colonel le maire whom you know is the bearer of this he comes to virginia to obtain the two thousand acres of land given him for his services in procuring us arms and what else he may be entitled to as having been an officer in our service above all things he wishes to obtain the cincinnatus eagle because it will procure him here the order of st louis and of course a pension for life of one thousand livres he is so extremely poor that another friend and myself furnish him money for his whole expenses from here to virginia there i am in hopes the hospitality of the country will be a resource for him till he can convert a part of his lands advantageously into money but as he will want some small matter of money if it should be convenient for you to furnish him with as much as ten guineas from time to time on my account i will invest that sum in books or anything else you may want here by way of payment he is honest and grateful and you may be assured that no aid that you can give him in the forwarding his claims will be misplaced    thomas jefferson nov         paris james monroe to james monroe mon mss paris nov         dear sir —your journey to the westward having prevented my writing to you till now that a letter may probably find you at congress i shall resume     the correspondence discontinued since i left boston my passage was remarkably short being only    days from land to land  i suffered little by sickness having very thick weather when we approached the coast of europe we fell in with no vessel which could take me  put me on the french coast as i had intended i therefore went ashore at portsmouth where i was detained three or four days by a fever which had seized my daughter two days before we landed as soon as she was clear of it i hired a vessel to carry me over to havre from whence i came on to this place thro a country than which nothing can be more fertile better cultivated  more elegantly improved it was at the time when harvest was beginning  it is principally a farming country i informed you from boston that before i had received your letters of may     june   i had packed up our cypher and therefore could not there make out the passages which were put into cypher i have tried it here  find that by some unfortunate mistake probably in the young gentleman who wrote the cypher it will not explain a single syllable he has arranged all the numbers in their regular order and then placed against each the words syllables c in alphabetical order you can judge whether this was the plan of it the want of the cypher would have restrained me from mentioning some things were i not assured of the fidelity of the bearer hereof colo le maire i am to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of aug   from new york but not of the previous one     therein mentioned to be sent by mr short he being not yet come nor any tidings of him the die is thrown here  has turned up war doubts whether an accommodation may not yet take place are still entertained by some but i hold it impossible probably the emperor will encourage negociations during the winter while no warlike operations may go on in order to amuse his adversary  lessen their preparations it is believed the campaign will open on the scheld how the other nations of europe will conduct themselves seems very doubtful the probability is that france prussia  the porte will take an active part with the dutch  russia with the germans it is presumed that england will endeavor to keep out of the scrape   because she cannot borrow money to take part in it   because ireland is likely to give her disturbance   because her disputes with us are not settled by a full execution of the articles of the treaty and the hatred of her people towards us has arisen to such a height as to prepare their minds for a recommencement of hostilities should their government find this desirable supposing we are not involved in a new contest with great britain this war may possibly renew that disposition in the powers of europe to treat with us on liberal principles a disposition which blazed out with enthusiasm on the conclusion of peace but which had subsided as far below the just level in consequence of the anarchy  depravation of principle which the british papers have constantly held forth as having taken place among us i think when     it shall become certain that war is to take place that those nations at least who are engaged in it will be glad to ensure our neutrality  friendly dispositions by a just treaty such a one or none is our business with england nothing will produce a treaty but an enforcement of the resolutions of congress proposing that there should be no trade where there is no treaty the infatuation of that nation seems really preternatural if anything will open their eyes it will be an application to the avarice of the merchants who are the very people who have opposed the treaty first meditated and who have excited the spirit of hostility at present prevailing against us deaf to every principle of common sense insensible to the feelings of man they firmly believe they shall be permitted by us to keep all the carrying trade and that we shall attempt no act of retaliation because they are pleased to think it our interest not to do so a gentleman immediately from england dined the other day at the same house with an american they happened to sit next each other at table and spoke on the subject of our commerce he had the air of a man of credibility he said that just before his departure from england he had a conversation with mr pitt in which mr pitt assured him the proclamation of which we complain would be passed into an act at the next session of parliament—in the despatches we send to congress you will see a great interval between the spanish ambassadors answer to us  our reply to him the reason of our keeping back was the hope that in the meantime he would get an answer from his court     which would save us the difficulty of answering him i have had a hint that they may agree to make new orleans a free port for our vessels coming down the missisipi but without permission to us to export our produce thence all the inadequacies of this to our purpose strike me strongly yet i would wish you to sound your acquaintances on this subject  to let me know what they think of it and whether if nothing more can be obtained this or no treaty that is to say this or war would be preferred—can nothing be done for young franklin he is sensible discreet polite  goodhumored  fully qualified as a secretaire dambassade his grandfather has none annexed to his legation at this court he is most sensibly wounded at his grandsons being superseded should this war take place it would certainly be acceptable to congress to receive regular early  authentic intelligence of its operations in this view would it not be worth while to continue the agency of dumas his intelligence has all these qualities he is undoubtedly in the confidence of some one who has a part in the dutch government  who seems to allow him to communicate to us—before my arrival here mr barclay in consequence of the powers given him by his commission had made an appointment or two of consuls for some of the ports of this country particularly of franks for marseilles he is very anxious to be continued in it  is now there in the exercise of his office if i have been rightly informed his services  sacrifices during the war have had their merit and i should suppose congress would not supersede him but on     good grounds i promised him that i would communicate his wishes to some of my friends that his pretensions might not be set aside for want of being known—there is an idea here of removing the packets from lorient to havre this latter may be considered as the port of paris itself because the transportation between them is down the seine in boats  makes scarcely a greater addition to the price than in transportation from a warehouse to the waterside paris is the only place at which all the productions  manufactures of france are brought to a point mr tracy who is here from boston has carefully examined into all their manufactures and finds them of almost every kind as good as in england  cheaper generally this truth once known  our ships coming hither for those articles which england thinks she alone can furnish us will advantage us first in opening to us double markets  secondly in the shock it will communicate across the channel lorient is convenient in war  therefore should be left as it is a free port but conveyances from hence thither are by land long precarious  expensive i think our merchants will turn their views on havre—there is here some frenchman from philadelphia perhaps perée who has drawn up a visionary scheme of a settlement of french emigrants  00 in number on the ohio he supposes congress flattered by the prospect of such an addition to our numbers will give them  00000 acres of land  permit them to continue french subjects my opinion has been asked  i have given it that congress will make     bargains with nobody that they will lay down general rules to which all applicants must conform themselves by applying to the proper offices  not perplexing congress with their visions that they are sufficiently assured that the land office will absorb all their certificates of public debt beyond which they have no object but to provide that the new governments shall admit an easy  firm union with the old  that therefore i did not think they would encourage a settlement in so large a body of strangers whose language manners  principles were so heterogeneous to ours—i shall subscribe for you to the encyclopedia methodique it will be in about  0 vols  will cost     livres equal to  0 english guineas if you should not chuse to take it it will be only a sacrifice of the subscription money which is a guinea  half the subscription is daily expected to be closed there is about two fifths of the work now ready to be delivered amounting to about  00 livres—we have taken some pains to find out the sums which the nations of europe give to the barbary states to purchase their peace they will not tell this yet from some glimmerings it appears to be very considerable and i do expect that they would tax us at one two or perhaps three hundred thousand dollars a year surely our people will not give this would it not be better to offer them an equal treaty if they refuse why not go to war with them spain portugal naples france  venice are now at war with them every part of the mediterranean therefore would offer us friendly ports we ought to begin a naval power if we mean to carry on our     own commerce can we begin it on a more honorable occasion or with a weaker foe i am of opinion paul jones with half a dozen frigates would totally destroy their commerce not by attempting bombardments as the mediterranean states do wherein they act against the whole barbary force brought to a point but by constant cruising  cutting them to pieces by piecemeal—i must say a word on my own affairs because they are likely to be distressed all the ministers who came to europe before me came at a time when all expences were paid and a sum allowed in addition for their time of course they all had their outfit afterwards they were put on fixed salaries but still these were liberal congress in the moment of my appointment struck off  00 guineas of the sallary and made no other provision for the outfit but allowing me to call for two quarters salary in advance the outfit has cost me near a thousand guineas for which i am in debt and which were i to stay here seven years i could never make good by savings out of my salary for be assured we are the lowest  most obscure of the whole diplomatic tribe when i was in congress i chose never to intermeddle on the subject of salary first because i was told the eyes of some were turned on me for this office  secondly because i was really ignorant what might be its expences the latter reason ceases the former which presents me as an interested person shall still keep me silent with all the world but yourself to whose secrecy  delicacy i can trust i live here about as well as we did at annapolis i keep a hired carriage  two horses     a riding horse i cannot afford to keep this still is far below the level yet it absorbs the whole allowance and return when i will to america i shall be the outfit in debt to congress i think i am the first instance in the world where it has not been given i mention these circumstances to you that if you should think the allowance reasonable and any opportunity should occur while you are in congress wherein it can be decently obtained you would be so good as to think of it i would wish it could be done on some general occasion the article of houserent in mr adams account in holland and in dr franklins here may perhaps afford an occasion of touching on this article as to myself mr a lived at the hague in a house belonging to the u s the question is whether you will charge him rent dr f has lived in a house the rent of which  000 livres per ann has been always charged to the u s the question on that is whether you will reject that  make him pay eight or nine years rent if these articles pass it will of course add houserent to the salaries which will be some aid but not an adequate one for the ministers in general when this matter shall be considered the difference which has taken place between them  me as to the article of outfit may perhaps be mentioned  redressed otherwise as i have before mentioned i shall return that much in debt  be obliged to sell to pay it a circumstance which i shall think hard i ask nothing for my time but i think my expences should be paid in a stile equal to that of those with whom i am classed—i must ask the favor of you on behalf     of mr adams as well as myself to explain the following transaction to our commissioners of the treasury congress you know directed the financier to advance me two quarters salary he gave me a letter of credit to mr grand relying on the effect of this i had ordered furniture for a small hotel which i rent  had entered into engagements for paying part of the rent in advance a little before the parties were to call on me for the money i applied to mr grand but our funds were out  i found he was not disposed to advance the money nothing could equal my distress in this situation mr adams thought himself justifiable in drawing in my favor on the fund in holland for  000 florins knowing of the order of congress in my favor of the failure of the funds here and that it could not be important to congress from what part the money came it was unlucky i did not know of the failure here before i had contracted the debt because i could have hired furniture for one third or one half of its worth annually but this was such miserable economy amounting to from   ⅓ to  0 per cent per ann for the use of money as induced me to buy i wish this to be explained to the commissioners to save mr adams from censure address your letters a monsr monsr jefferson ministre plenipotentiaire des etats unis de lamerique a paris culdesac tetebout   0 thomas jefferson nov         paris charles thomson to charles thomson  paris nov   th      dear sir —    there has been a lamp called the cylinder lamp lately invented here it gives a light equal as is thought to that of six or eight candles it requires olive oil but its consumption is not great the improvement is produced by forcing the wick into a hollow cylinder so that there is a passage for the air through the hollow the idea had occurred to doctor franklin a year or two before but he tried his experiment with a rush which not succeeding he did not prosecute it the fact was the rush formed too small a cylinder the one used is of an inch diameter they make shade candlesticks for studious men which are excellent for reading these cost two guineas i should have sent you a specimen of the phosphoric matches but that i am told mr rittenhouse has had some of them they are a beautiful discovery and very useful especially to heads which like yours and mine cannot at all times be got to sleep the convenience of lighting a candle without getting out of bed sealing letters without calling a servant of kindling a fire without flint steel punk c are of value will you subscribe for the encyclopedie methodique the subscription is as yet open about twofifths of the work is published the whole will cost to subscribers     livres i know of no other work here lately published or now on hand which is interesting i must pray you send me a complete copy of the     journals from nov        downwards the few sheets i had i sent when in philadelphia to dunlap to complete and he never returned them or any others to me i have the pleasure of seeing mr norris sometimes i am in hopes he is discreet and that you need not fear the corruption of his morals he is well at present there is one danger at his age which some other instances have proved real—that of forming a connection as is the fashion here which he might be unwilling to shake off when it shall be proper for him to return to his own country and which might detain him disadvantageously here i have not the smallest intimation that he is disposed to do this but it is difficult for young men to refuse it where beauty is a begging in every street indeed from what i have seen here i know not one good purpose on earth which can be affected by a young gentleman coming here he may learn indeed to speak the language but put this in the scale amongst other things he will learn and evils he is sure to acquire and it will be found too light i have always disapproved of a european education for our youth from theory i now do it from inspection thomas jefferson   december      paris james madison to james madison paris   december         i thank you very much for the relation of the proceedings of assembly it is the most grateful of all things to get those details when one is so distant from home i like to see a disposition     increasing to replenish the public coffers and so far approve of the young stamp act but would it not be better to simplify the system of taxation rather than to spread it over such a variety of subjects and pass the money through so many new hands taxes should be proportioned to what may be annually spared by the individual but i do not see that the sale of his land is an evidence of his ability to spare one of my reasons for wishing to centre our commerce at norfolk was that it might bring to a point the proper subjects of taxation and reduce the army of taxgatherers almost to a single hand the simplest system of taxation yet adopted is that of levying on the land and the labourer but it would be better to levy the same sums on the produce of that labour when collected in the barn of the farmer because then if through the badness of the year he made little he would pay little it would be better yet to levy only on the surplus of this product above his own wants it would be better too to levy it not in his hands but in those of the merchant purchaser because tho the farmer would in fact pay it as the merchant purchaser would deduct it from the original price of his produce yet the farmer would not be sensible that he paid it this idea would no doubt meet its difficulties  objections when it should come to be reduced to practice yet i suspect it would be practical  expedient our taxgatherers in virginia cost as much as the whole civil list besides what a comfort to the farmer to be allowed to supply his own wants before he should be liable to pay anything  then only pay on his surplus—the     proposition for a convention has had the result i expected if one could be obtained i do not know whether it would not do more harm than good while mr henry lives another bad constitution would be formed  forever on us what we have to do i think is devotedly to        for his death in the meantime to  0              the        that the present is but an      to         the     of the       0     i am glad the  00               0     have again shewn their teeth  fangs the     00 had almost forgotten them i still hope something will be done for paine he richly deserves it and it will give a character of littleness to our state if they suffer themselves to be restrained from the compensation due for his services by the paltry consideration that he opposed our right to the western country who was there out of virginia who did not oppose it place this circumstance in one scale and the effect his writings produced in uniting us in independence in the other and say which preponderates have we gained more by his advocation of independence than we lost by his opposition to our territorial right pay him the balance only i look anxiously to the approaching and improving the navigation of the potomac and ohio the actual junction of the big beaver and cuyahoga by a canal as also that of albemarle sound and elizabeth through the dismal these works will spread the field of our commerce westwardly and southwardly beyond anything ever yet done by man i once hinted to you the project of seating yourself     in the neighborhood of monticello and my sanguine wishes made me look on your answer as not absolutely excluding the hope monroe is decided in settling there and is actually engaged in the endeavor to purchase short is the same would you but make it a partie quarrée i should believe that life had still some happiness in store for me agreeable society is the first essential in constituting the happiness and of course the value of our existence and it is a circumstance worthy great attention when we are making first our choice of a residence weigh well the value of this against the difference in pecuniary interest and ask yourself which will add most to the sum of your felicity through life i think that weighing them in this balance your decision will be favorable to all our prayers looking back with fondness to the moment when i am again to be fixed in my own country i view the prospect of this society as inestimable i find you thought it worth while to pass the last summer in exploring the woods of america and i think you were right do you not think the men and arts of this country would be worth another summer you can come in april pass the months of may june july august and most of september here and still be back to the commencement of real business in the assembly following which i would not have you absent from you shall find with me a room bed and plate if you will do me the favor to become one of the family as you would be here only for the summer season i think your outfit of clothes need not cost you more than  0 guineas and perhaps the attendance     on the theatres and public entertainments with other small expenses might be half a guinea or three quarters a day your passage backward and forward would i suppose be  0 or  0 guineas more say that the whole would be  00 guineas you will for that have purchased the knowledge of another world i expect monroe will come in the spring and return to congress in the fall if either this object or the one preceding for settling you near monticello can be at all promoted by the use of the money which the assembly have given me for my share in the revisal make use of it freely and be assured it can in no other way be applied so much to my gratification the return of it may wait your perfect convenience    thomas jefferson dec  0      paris james monroe to james monroe mon mss paris dec  0      dear sir —i wrote you the   th of nov by the last packet since that i have received by mr short yours of july  0 inclosing the cypher i hope that the establishment of a port on each river will end in the final success of one or of two only actual circumstances will prevent york  tappahanoc from being any thing in spite of any encouragement the accumulation of commodities at norfolk  alexander will be so great as to carry all purchasers there  york  tappahanoc will find it their interest to send their commodities to the same places in order to have the benefit of a competition among a great mass of purchasers it is not amiss     to encourage alexandria because it is a rival in the very bosom of baltimore i know of no investigation at the instance or any nation of the extent of the clause giving the rights of the most favoured nation but from the import of the words themselves  from the clause that a privilege granted to any other nation shall immediately become common freely where freely granted or yielding the compensation  where a compensation is given i have no doubt that if any one nation will admit our goods duty free in consideration of our doing the same by them no other nation can claim an exception from duties in our ports without yielding us the same in theirs the abolition of the monopoly of our tobacco in the hands of the farmers general will be pushed by us with all our force but it is so interwoven with the very foundations of their system of finance that it is of doubtful event i could not get my answer to the queries on virginia printed in philadelphia but i am printing it here  will certainly ask your acceptance of a copy can you employ the succeeding summer better than by coming here suppose congress rises in time for you to sail by the first of april you may pass may june july august  september here  still be at the meeting of the ensuing congress you shall find with me a room bed  plate with a hearty welcome  i do not think the other expences of your passage coming  going outfit of clothes attending the theatres  other public places will exceed  00 guineas i have recommended the same measure     to mr madison perhaps you can make the voyage together i wrote you in my last that there would probably be war the common belief is now that the matters will be accomodated these who are not in the secrets of the cabinet can only judge from external circumstances every movement of the two parties indicate war i found much too on the character of the emperor whose public acts speak him much above the common level those who expect peace say also that they have in view the emperors character which they represent as whimsical and eccentric  that he is especially affected in the dog days we shall not know what will be done till the spring admits the movement of troops into the field i see no probable event which may divert the emperor from his object but the health of the empress of russia which at present is very precarious any accident to her might possibly cripple the projects of vienna by this packet congress will receive the british ambassadors letter to us it appears extraordinary when in our letter to him we had informed him that we three in number had full powers to treat that his court should propose in answer as a previous stipulation that congress should send a person with full powers to london i cannot suppose they have any personal objections and therefore believe they only want to gain time in order to see how their schemes will work without a treaty we shall bring them to an issue i suppose it will probably end in our going to london i think that after this we shall be obliged to go to     madrid  probably to some of the other more important courts as it is impossible for us whenever we leave paris to give up out homes in which are our furniture  whatever we do not carry with us and to find others in the instant of our return  to remove into them it is visible that during these journeys we are subject to double expences for a confidential servant must be left to take care of the house and as during our travels the daily expences will be much greater than at paris where we are settled it will shew the reasonableness of congress allowing house rent in the cases formally mentioned to you of mr adams and doctor franklin  of course to me i write on this subject to you alone  would not to you were it not  0  from circumstances explained in a former letter i am like to be distressed in the article of house rent my case will of course rest on a common bottom with the other gentlemen indeed theirs being to be previously settled mine will follow of course and i would not have the article of the outfit mentioned if it should be like to excite with an   0     present with thought as to me it appears to me not subject to the       0       of an attack  to desire to have my expences paid or i would have surpressed the first thought of it there are great complaints of the stoppage of letters in new york as well those which are coming from america to france as those from france to america if a letter is sent from hence for s carolina for instance it is deposited at n york till the french postage is paid if one is sent from s carolina to france it is deposited at n y till the     american postage is paid every person then in france or america who ever expects to receive a letter by post must keep an agent  a little bank in new york in europe this matter is so arranged that letters pass from one country to another without the least difficulty france has a convention for this purpose with almost every country in europe she had such a one with england till the late war  they are now proposing to renew it would it not be well for congress to send us an instruction  power to form conventions to facilitate the passage of letters with those powers with whom we form treaties or at least with some of them it is certainly material with france holland gr br spain  portugal  perhaps the italian states be so good as to present my compliments to your collegues i think mr hardy promised to write to me sometimes i shall take great pleasure in an exchange of information with him p s i hope you will not desist from your plan of settlement in albem short will join us  i hope mr madison can you inform me if letters to  from us are free of postage in america thomas jefferson dec         paris horatio gates to horatio gates  paris dec         dear general —i duly received the letter you were so good as to write me from new york we have here under our contemplation the future   0 miseries of human nature like to be occasioned by the ambition of a young man who has been taught to view his subjects as his cattle the pretensions he sets up to the navigation of the scheld would have been good if natural right had been left uncontrolled but it is impossible for express compact to have taken away a right more effectually than it has the emperors there are numbers here but not of the cabinet who still believe he will retract but i see no one circumstance on which to found such a belief nothing had happened but what he must have forseen and calculated on and in fact all his movements indicate war the dutch are truly animated and ready to place their existence on the stake now contended for the spring which brings general happiness to all other beings will probably open the sluices of calamity on our wretched fellow creatures on this side of the atlantic france holland prussia  turkey against the two empires i think will be an overmatch england will be neuter from interest as well as importance the disposition of her inhabitants is very unfriendly to us it remains to see whether their ministers suffer themselves to be led by passions also i think it probable we shall go over there for a short time an american vessel a virginia has been lately taken by a frigate of the emperor of morocco who has five of them cruising on the atlantic the brig had just left cadiz our trade to portugal spain  the mediteranean is annihilated unless we do something decisive tribute or war is the usual alternative of these pirates if we yield the power it will require sums which our     people will feel why not begin a navy then  decide on war we cannot begin in a better cause nor against a weaker foe you will have heard that the e of shelburne is made marquis of lansdown  lord temple marquis of buckingham there is no appearance however of the former coming into the ministry which seem absolutely firm thomas jefferson jan         paris nathanael greene to nathanael greene  paris jan         sir —everything in europe is quiet  promises quiet for at least a year to come we do not find it easy to make commercial arrangements in europe there is a want of confidence in us this country has lately reduced the duties on american whale oil to about a guinea  a half a ton and i think they will take the greatest part of what we can furnish i hope therefore that this branch of our commerce will resume its activity portugal shews a disposition to court our trade but this has for some time been discouraged by the hostilities of the pyratical states of barbary the emperor of morocco who had taken one of our vessels immediately consented to suspend hostilities  ultimately gave up the vessel cargo  crew i think we shall be able to settle matters with him but i am not sanguine as to the algerines they have taken two of our vessels and i fear will ask such a tribute for the forbearance of their piracies as the u s would be unwilling to pay—when this     idea comes across my mind my faculties are absolutely suspended between indignation  impotence—i think whatever sums we are obliged to pay for freedom of navigation in the european seas should be levied on european commerce with us by a separate impost that these powers may see that they protect these enormities for their own loss thomas jefferson jan         paris patrick henry to the governor of virginia patrick henry v s a paris jan         sir —the letter of july  0      with which your excellency was pleased to honour me  which inclosed the resolution of assembly for the statue of genl washington came to my hands on the   th of nov by mr short  a few days afterwards i received a duplicate of it as it was not practicable to get the business into any train before the sailing of the december packet i omitted acknowledging its receipt till the packet of this month should sail there could be no question raised as to the sculptor who should be employed the reputation of monsr houdon of this city being unrivalled in europe he is resorted to for the statues of most of the sovereigns in europe on conversing with him doctr franklin  myself became satisfied that no statue could be executed so as to obtain the approbation of those to whom the figure of the original is known but on an actual view by the artist of course no statue of genl washington which might be a true     evidence of his figure to posterity could be made from his picture statues are made every day from portraits but if the person be living they are always condemned by those who know him for a want of resemblance and this furnishes a conclusive presumption that similar representations of the dead are equally unfaithfull monsr houdon whose reputation is such as to make it his principal object was so anxious to be the person who should hand down the figure of the general to future ages that without hesitating a moment he offered to abandon his business here to leave the statues of kings unfinished  to go to america to take the true figure by actual inspection  mensuration we believe from his character that he will not propose any very considerable sum for making this journey probably two or three hundred guineas as he must necessarily be absent three or four months  his expences will make at least a hundred guineas of the money when the whole merit of the piece was to depend on this previous expenditure we could not doubt your approbation of the measure and that you would think with us that things which are just or handsome should never be done by halves we shall regulate the article of expence as œconomically as we can with justice to the wishes of the world this article together with the habit attitude devices c are now under consideration  till they be decided on we cannot ultimately contract with monsr houdon we are agreed in one circumstance that the size shall be precisely that of life were we to have executed a statue in any other case we should have     preferred making it somewhat larger than life because as they are generally a little elivated they appear smaller but we think it important that some one monument should be preserved of the true size as well as figure from which all other countries and our own at any future day when they shall desire it may take copies varying them in their dimensions as may suit the particular situation in which they wish to place them the duty as well as the glory of this presentation we think belongs peculiarly to virginia we are sensible that the eye alone considered will not be quite as well satisfied but connecting the consideration that the whole  every part of it presents the true size of the life we suppose the beholders will receive a greater pleasure on the whole should we agree with monsr houdon he will come over in the april packet  of course may be expected in virginia about the last of may his stay with the general will be about a month this will be employed in forming his bust of plaister with this he will return to paris  will then be between two  three years in executing the whole in marble i have thought it my duty to detail to your excellency our ideas on the subject as far as they are settled that if in any point we are varying from the wishes of the executive or legislature we may be set right in time i conjecture that you will receive this about the latter end of february and as monsr houdon will not set out till about the   th or   th of april there may be time to receive your pleasure in the mean while we think that the whole expence of the journey  execution of the figure will be within the     limits conjectured by your excellency but of this we cannot be certain as yet thomas jefferson feb      james monroe to james monroe mon mss feb      dear sir —you were informed by my letters of nov     jan    that the cypher established between us would not explain a syllable of your letters—those of nov    dec    having rendered me extremely desirous of deciphering them i set to work with a resolution to effect it if possible i soon found that they were written by your first cypher to this therefore i applied myself and after several days spent on it i was able to set to rights the many errors of your copyist whose inattention alone had inducted those difficulties i found the numbers in my copy  yours to correspond as follows from  –    was right     in yours corresponded to     in mine from     to  0  in yours corresponded to from     to     in mine from  0  to     in yours corresponded to from     to     in mine from     to     in yours corresponded to from     to     in mine from     to     in yours

often enough     to detect the errors i have now therefore completely deciphered your letters of june   june    nov   and dec    at present my only uneasiness is about my letters which have gone to you in cypher that of nov    must have been in the  st cypher for this reason i have noted to you the differences in our copies as above that you may translate my numbers into yours as i received the  d cypher the   th of nov i think it probable that my letters of dec  0  jan    were written by that if they were i am in hopes you will have understood them if they were written by the  st you will now be able by translating the numbers to understand them also and thus this comedy of errors will be cleared up since writing so far i have made out a table adjusting the numbers in my copy to those in yours which will enable you to translate with ease our business goes on very slowly no answers from spain or britain the backwardness of the latter is not new perhaps mr jay or mr laurens who have been at that court since the present ministry has been in place may have been able to account for this on better grounds than we can the english parliament irish parliament and irish convention sitting together will surely bring their disputes to a crisis scotland too seems to be stepping in as a third party with her difficulties and their affairs in the east indies are in a wretched situation the opposition have opened their campaign on the east india regulations the proceedings with ireland  the late taxes the minister having declared he will propose a     plan of parliamentary reform they have taken the contrary side of course on that question i am anxious to see whether the parliament will take any and what steps as to our commerce the effecting treaties with the powers holding positions in the west indies i consider as the important part of our business it is not of great consequence whether the others treat or not perhaps trade may go on with them well enough without but britain spain portugal france are consequent and holland denmark sweden may be of service too we have hitherto waited for favorable circumstances to press matters with france we are now about to do it tho i cannot say the prospect is good the merchants of this country are very clamorous against our admission into the west indies and ministers are afraid for their places the pamphlet which i sent you is approved by the sensible people here and i am in hopes has been of some service there are warm ones written against it our affairs with the pyratical states are distressing it is impossible i fear to find out what is given by other countries either shame or jealousy makes them wish to keep it secret several of their ministers to whom we have applied have promised to procure information these pyrates are contemptibly weak morocco who has just dared to commit an outrage on us owns only four or five frigates of    or  0 guns there is not a port in their country which has more than    feet water tunis is not quite so strong having   or   frigates only small and worthless is more mercantile than predatory and would easily be led to treat either by money or     fear tripoli has one frigate only algiers alone possesses any power  they are brave as far as i have been able to discover she possesses about    vessels from    up to    guns but the vessels of all these powers are wretched in the last degree being mostly built of the discordant pieces of other vessels which they take and pull asunder their cordage  sails are of the same kind taken from vessels of different sizes  powers seldom any two guns of the same bore  all of them light these states too are divided  jealous of each other  especially of algiers the most powerful the others would willingly see her reduced we have two plans to pursue the one to carry nothing for ourselves  thereby render ourselves invulnerable to the european states the other which our country will be for is to carry as much as possible but this will require a protecting force on the sea otherwise the smallest power in europe every one which possesses a single ship of the line may dictate to us and enforce their demands by captures on our commerce some naval force then is necessary if we mean to be commercial can we have a better occasion of beginning one or find a foe more certainly within our dimensions the motives pleading for war rather than tribute are numerous  honorable those opposing them are mean  short sighted however if it be decided that their peace shall be bought it shall engage my most earnest endeavours—it is as uncertain as ever whether we are to have war or peace the ministers of this country intimate peace and monst de maillebois who is to command     the dutch army is not set out i should consider his departure as an indication of war i must pray you to send your letters by the french packet they come by that conveyance with certainty having first undergone the ceremony of being opened  read in the post office which i am told is done in every country in europe letters by the way of england are sometimes months getting from london here give me fully always the congressional news  by every letter if you please the journals of congress i would make an additional observation or two as to the pyratical states if we enter into treaty there a consul must be kept with each to recover our vessels taken in breach of their treaty for these violations they practise constantly against the strongest nations  the vessels so taken are recovered with trouble  always some loss  considerable delay the attempts heretofore made to suppress these powers have been to exterminate them at one blow they are too numerous and powerful by land for that a small effort but long continued seems to be the only method by suppressing their marine  trade totally and continuing this till the present race of seamen should be pretty well out of the way  the younger people betake themselves to husbandry for which their toil  climate is well fitted these nests of banditti might be reformed i am not well enough acquainted with the present disposition of the european courts to say whether a general confederacy might be formed for suppressing these pyracies such as should refuse would give us a just right to  00 turn pyrates also on their west india trade and to require an annual tribute which might reimburse what we may be obliged to pay to obtain a safe navigation in their seas were we possessed even of a small naval force what a bridle would it be in the mouths of the west indian powers and how respectfully would they demean themselves towards us be assured that the present disrespect of the nations of europe for us will inevitably bring on insults which must involve us in war a coward is much more exposed to quarrels than a man of spirit be so good as to present one of the pamphlets with my esteem to mr gherry  let him know he is a letter in my debt thomas jefferson mar         paris james madison to james madison paris mar         dear sir —my last to you was dated dec   since that yours of feb   has come to hand and i am in hopes i shall shortly receive from you the history of the last session of our assembly i will pray you always to send your letters by the french packet which sails from n york the   th of every month i had made neill jamieson my post master general there who will always take care of my letters and confide them to passengers when there are any worthy of confidence since the removal of congress to that place you can chuse between n jamieson  our delegates there to which you would rather address my letters the worst conveyances you can possibly find are private hands  0  or merchant ships coming from virginia directly to france those letters either come not at all or like the histories of antient times they detail to us events after their influence is spent your character of the     magistrate  is precisely agreeable to the idea i had formed of him i take him to be of unmeasured ambition but that the men he uses are virtuous he is re     ed fraught with affection to     and dispose merchants to render every  0   service of the cause which separated the com of the states we never have had                          0 0   0     and   0          00     from newspapers  private letters have excited without satisfying our curiosity as your cipher is safe pay     me a de    of it the navigation of the scheld had for a great while agitated the politics of europe  seemed to threaten the involving it in a general war all of a sudden another subject infinitely more interesting is brought on the carpet there is reason to believe that the emperor has made an exchange of territories with the elector of bavaria  that while the scheld has been the ostensible bavaria has been the real object of his military preparations when the proposition was communicated to the king of prussia it is said he declared quil moverroit le cul sur le selle rather than see it take effect the          00  it is thought would be secretly  0 0         with it and some think that certain   said to be                 by the emperor on the             of  0  are meant to be given to the latter for her  0  acquiescence i am attending with anxiety to the part she will act on this occasion i shall change my opinion of her system of policy if it be not executable if the dutch escape war they seem still to be in danger of internal revolution the stadholder  aristocracy can carry their differences no further without an appeal to the sword the people are on the side of the     the conduct of the aristocracy in pushing their measures to such extremity is inexplicable but on the supposition that  0  has promised to support them which it is        was         to do before they would enter into the late treaty we hear nothing from england this circumstance with the passage of their n f land bill thro the house of commons  the sending a consul to america which we hear they have done sufficiently prove a perseverance in the system of managing for us as well as for themselves in their connection with us the administration of that country are governed by the people  the people by their own interested wishes without calculating whether they are just or capable of being effected nothing will bring them to reason but physical obstruction applied to their bodily senses we must show that we are capable of foregoing commerce with them before they will be capable of consenting to an equal commerce we have all the world besides open to supply us with gewgaws and all the world to buy our tobacco for in such an event england must buy it from amsterdam lorient or any other place at which we should think proper to deposit it for them they allow our commodities to be taken from our own ports to the  0  w indies in their vessels only let us allow their vessels to take them to no port the transportation of our own produce is worth   0000 £ sterl annually will employ  00000 tonnage of ships    000 seamen constantly it will be no misfortune that gr br obliges us to exclude her from a participation in this business our own shipping will grow fast under the exclusion  till it is equal to the object the dutch will supply us the commerce with the eng w i is valuable  would be worth a sacrifice to us but the commerce with the british dominion in europe is a losing one  deserves no sacrifice our tobacco they must have from whatever place we make its deposit because they can get no other whose quality so well suits the habits of their people it is not a commodity like wheat which will not bear a double voyage were it so the privilege of carrying it directly to england might be worth something i know nothing which would act more powerfully as a sumptuary law with our people than an inhibition of commerce with england they are habituated to the luxuries of that country  will have them while they can get them they are unacquainted with those of other countries and therefore will not very soon bring them so far into fashion as that it shall be thought disreputable not to have them in ones house or on their table—it is to be considered how far an exemption of ireland from this inhibition would embarrass the councils of engld on the one hand and defeat the regulation itself on the other i rather believe it would do more harm in the latter way than good in the  0  former in fact a heavy aristocracy  corruption are two bridles in the mouths of the irish which will prevent them from making any effectual efforts against their masters we shall now  0      call for decisive answer to certain points interesting to the     and unconnected with the general treaty which they have a right to decline i mentioned to you in a former letter a very good dictionary of universal law called the code dhumanité in    vols  to meeting by chance an opportunity of buying a copy new  well bound for  0  livres i purchased it for you it comes to   livres a volume which is a fraction over a dollar  a half  in england costs   sterl a volume i shall have an opportunity of sending this  what other books i have bought for you in may but new information throws me all into doubt what to do with them late letters tell us you are nominated for the  0 of spain  i must depend on further intelligence therefore to decide whether to send them or to await your orders i need not tell you how much i shall be pleased with such an event yet it has its displeasing sides also i sent in the   0   0 and also in   0 yet we cannot have                 we must therefore be contented to have              00      adieu yours affectionately c thomas jefferson mar         paris james monroe to james monroe mon mss paris mar         dear sir —i wrote you by the packet which sailed from hence in feb and then acknowledged  0  the receipt of yours of dec    which came by the packet arriving here in jan that which sailed from n y in jan  arrived here in feb brings me no letter from any body except from mr jay to mr adams dr f  myself jointly since my last the rumor of an exchange proposed between the emperor  el of bavaria has proved to have some foundation what issue it will be permitted to have is doubtful the k of prussia will risk his own annihilation to prevent it the dutch would rather be pleased with it and it is thought by some that it will not be disagreeable to france it has even been said that certain places are reserved by the emperor on the borders of france to give to this court by way of trust money i am watching with anxiety the part which this court will act if the sordid one suspected by some i shall renounce all faith in national rectitude and believe that in public conduct we are not yet emerged from the rascality of the   th century there are great numbers of well enlightened men in this nation the ministry is such the king has an honest heart the line of policy hitherto pursued by them has been such as virtue would dictate and wisdom approve relying on their wisdom only i think they would not accept the bribe suppose it would be to relinquish that honorable character of disinterestedness and new faith which they have acquired by many sacrifices and which has put in their hands the government as it were of europe a wise man if nature has not formed him honest will yet act as if he were honest because he will find it the most advantageous  wise part in the long run i have believed that  0  this court possesses this high species of wisdom even if its new faith be ostensible only if they trip on any occasion it will be warning to us i do not expect they will but it is our business to be on the watch the dutch seem to be on the brink of some internal revolution even if they escape being engaged in war as appearances at present seem to indicate the division between the stadholder and the aristocracy cannot be greater  the people are on the side of the former the fury with which the aristocracy drive their measures is inexplicable but on the supposition that france has promised to support and this i believe she did to induce them to the late treaty we hear nothing from england this circumstance with the passage of their n f land bill through the h of commons and the sending a consul to america which we hear they have done sufficiently prove a perseverance in the system of managing for both sides in their connection with us our people and merchants must consider their business as not yet settled with england after exercising the self denial which was requisite to carry us thro the war they must push it a little further to obtain proper peace arrangements with them they can do it the better as all the world is open to them and it is very extraordinary if the whole world besides cannot supply them with what they may want i think it essential to exclude them from the carriage of american produce we wait the arrival of the packet which left you in feb in expectation of some instructions on the subject of england should none come we shall immediately press them for an  0  answer on those subjects which were unconnected with a treaty of commerce—it is to be considered how far an exception in favor of ireland in our commercial regulations might embarrass the councils of england on the one hand  on the other how far it might give room to an evasion of the regulations—mr carmichael has obtained the interference of the court of madrid for the vessel  crew taken by the emperor of morocco  i understand there is a prospect of their being restored a letter on this subject is come to doctr franklin i have not yet seen it  i doubt whether it will be in time to be copied  communicated by this packet the post being near its departure on the arrival of the packet now expected here whether she brings us new instructions or not as to those states we shall proceed to act for the best on the ground before marked out for us the marquis fayette has arrived here in good health and in the best dispositions towards us i have had a very bad winter having been confined the greatest part of it a seasoning as they call it is the lot of most strangers  none i believe have experienced a more severe one than myself the air is extremely damp and the waters very unwholesome we have had for three weeks past a warm visit from the sun my almighty physician and i find myself almost reestablished i begin now to be able to walk   or   miles a day  find myself much better for it if the state of our business will permit i wish much to take a tour through the south of france for three or four weeks the climate  exercise would i think restore my  0  health—i have used the second cypher in this letter either by a gentleman who will go to america in the april packet or by young mr adams who will go in may i will send you a new cypher which i have prepared on a large  commodious plan this young gentleman is i think very promising to a vast thirst after useful knowledge he adds a facility in acquiring it what his judgement may be i am not well enough acquainted with him to decide but i expect it is good  much hope it as he may become a valuable  useful citizen—i sent you by the former packet the pour and contre for the emancipation of the french w i trade i now send you the answer to it the mass of the nation is with the latter adieu thomas jefferson apr         paris james monroe to james monroe mon mss paris apr         dear sir —we wrote a public letter to mr jay the day before yesterday we were induced to hasten it because young mr chaumont was to set out yesterday for lorient to go to n york in the packet  a private conveyance is alone to be depended on for secracy i have put off writing any letters as long as i could expecting the arrival of the packet she is arrived as the packet of the last month did without bringing a scrip of a pen public or private to any american here this perplexes us extremely from your letter of dec    and from one written at the same time by mr jay to dr franklin we have reason to believe congress have  0  done some thing in the affairs with england and spain we also thought something would be said to us on the subject of the barbary state we therefore deferred moving lest we should have to change our move which is always dishonorable we particularly expected instructions as to the posts still held by the english we shall do the best we can under our old instructions the letter from the duke of dorset will dare say surprise you all it is a folly above the highest that could have been expected i know from one who saw his instructions that he softened them much in the letter to us the following paragraph is from a letter i received from doctor price about ten days ago there is i fancy no probability that britain can be brought to consent to that reciprocity in trade which the united states expect this is bad policy for britain but it may turn out to be best for america and should the issue be our exclusion from the american ports we may be ruined but i do not see that trade would suffer in its true interest the fixed conviction however is that we are able to employ america on so much better terms than any other country that do what we will we must have its trade it is dated march twenty he is said to be in great intimacy with mr pitt and i verily believe this paragraph contains the genuine creed of the nation and ministry you will observe that the  th article of our original draught of a treaty transmitted to the several courts was contrary to a right reserved by the states in the confederation we shall correct it in every instance war and peace still doubtful it rather seems   0 that the peace may continue a while yet but not very long the emperor has a head too combustible to be quiet he is an eccentric character all enterprise without calculation without principle without feelings ambitious in the extreme but too unsteady to surmount difficulties he had in view at one time to open the scheld to get maestricht from the dutch to take a large district from the turks to exchange some of his austrian dominions for bavaria to create a ninth electorate to make his nephew king of the romans and to change totally the constitution of hungary any one of these was as much as a wise prince would have undertaken at any one time quod ault valde ault sed non diu ault i send you voltaires legacy to the k of prussia a libel which will do much more injury to voltaire than to the king many of the traits in the character of the latter to which the former gives a turn satyrical  malicious are real virtues i should remind you that two packets have now come without bringing me a letter from you and should scold you soundly but that i consider it as certain evidence of your being sick if this be so you know you have my sincere prayers for better health but why has no body else written to me is it that one is forgotten as soon as their back is turned i have a better opinion of men it must be either that they think that the details known to themselves are known to every body  so come to us thro a thousand channels or that we should set no value on them nothing can be more erroneous than both those opinions we value those details little      great public  private in proportion to our distance from our own country and so far are they from getting to us through a thousand channels that we hear no more of them or of our country here than if we were among the dead i have never received a tittle from any member of congress but yourself  one letter from dr williamson—the d de rochefoucault is kind enough to communicate to us the intelligence which he receives from mr st john  the m de la f what he gets from his correspondents these have been our only sources of intelligence since the middle of december there are particular public papers here which collect and publish with a good deal of accuracy the facts connected with political arithmetic in one of these i have just read the following table of the proportion between the value of gold  silver in several countries germany   to         spain   to      0 holland   to   ¾ england   to   ½ france   to       00 savoy   to   ⅗ russia   to    the average is   to   ⅝ as congress were on this subject when i left them  i have not heard of their having finished it i thought this worth your notice since the warm weather has set in i am almost perfectly reestablished i am able now to walk six or eight miles a day which i do very regularly this must supply the place of the journey i had meditated into the south of france tho our business does not afford constant occupation it is of such a nature one does not know when our presence may be wanted i need add no signature but wishing you every happiness bid you adieu     thomas jefferson may         paris james madison to james madison mad mss paris may         dear sir —your favor of jan   came to my hands on the   th of april the very full and satisfactory detail of the proceedings of assembly which it contained gave me the highest pleasure the value of these communications can not be calculated at a shorter distance than the breadth of the atlantic having lately made a cypher on a more convenient plan than the one we have used i now transmit it to you by a monsr doradour who goes to settle in virginia his family will follow him next year should he have occasion of your patronage i beg leave to solicit it for him they yesterday finished printing my notes i had  00 copies printed but do not put them out of my own hands except two or three copies here  two which i shall send to america to yourself  colo monroe if they can be ready this evening as promised in this case you will receive one by monsr doradour i beg you to peruse it carefully because i ask your advice on it  ask no bodys else i wish to put it into the hands of the young men at the college as well on account of the political as physical parts but there are sentiments on some subjects which i apprehend might be displeasing to the country perhaps to the assembly or to some who lead it i do not wish to be exposed to their censure nor do i know how far their influence if exerted might effect a misapplication of law to such a publication were it made communicate it then in confidence to those whose judgments  information you would     pay respect to  if you think it will give no offence i will send a copy to each of the students of w m c and some others to my friends  to your disposal otherwise i shall only send over a very few copies to particular friends in confidence  burn the rest—answer me soon  without reserve do not view me as an author  attached to what he has written i am neither they were at first intended only for marbois when i had enlarged them i thought first of giving copies to three or four friends i have since supposed they might set our young students into a useful train of thought and in no event do i propose to admit them to go to the public at large a variety of accidents have postponed my writing to you till i have no further time to continue my letter the next packet will sail from havre i will then send your books  write more fully but answer me immediately on the preceding subject thomas jefferson june         paris patrick henry to the governor of virginia patrick henry v s a paris june         sir —i had the honor of receiving the day before yesterday the resolution of council of mar  0 and your letter of mar  0 and shall with great pleasure unite my endeavours with those of the m de la fayette and mr barclay for the purpose of procuring the arms desired nothing can be more wise than this determination to arm our people as it is impossible to say when our neighbors may think proper to give them exercise i suppose that the     establishing a manufacture of arms to go hand in hand with the purchase of them from hence is at present opposed by good reasons this alone would make us independent for an article essential to our preservation and workmen could probably be either got here or drawn from england to be embarked hence in a letter of jan    to govr harrison i informed him of the necessity that the statuary should see genl washington that we should accordingly send him over unless the executive disapproved of it in which case i prayed to receive their pleasure mr houdon being now reestablished in his health and no countermand received i hope this measure meet the approbation of the executive mr houdon will therefore go over with dr franklin some time in the next month i have the honour of inclosing you the substance of propositions which have been made from london to the farmers general of this country to furnish them with the tobaccoes of virginia  maryland which propositions were procured for me by the m de la fayette i take the liberty of troubling you with them on a supposition that it may be possible to have this article furnished from those two states to this country immediately without its passing through the entrepot of london  the returns for it being made of course in london merchandise  0000 hhds of tobō a year delivered here in exchange for the produce and manufactures of this country many of which are as good some better  most of them cheaper than in england would     establish a rivalship for our commerce which would have happy effects in all the three countries whether this end will be best effected by giving out these propositions to our merchants  exciting them to become candidates with the farmers general for this contract or by any other means your excellency will best judge on the spot thomas jefferson june         paris james monroe to james monroe  mon mss paris june         dear sir —i received three days ago your favor of apr    you therein speak of a former letter to me but it has not come to hand nor any other of later date than the   th of december my last letter to you was of the   th of may by mr adams who went in the packet of that month these conveiances are now becoming deranged we have had expectations of their coming to havre which would infinitely facilitate the communication between paris  congress but their deliberations on the subject seem to be taking another turn they complain of the expence and that their commerce with us is too small to justify it they therefore talk of sending a packet every six weeks only the present one therefore which should have sailed about this time will not sail until the  st of july however the whole matter is as yet undecided i have hoped that when mr st john arrives from n york     he will get them replaced on their monthly system by the bye what is the meaning of a very angry resolution of congress on this subject i have it not by me and therefore cannot cite it by date but you will remember it and will oblige me by explaining its foundation this will be handed you by mr otto who comes to america as chargé des affaires in the room of mr marbois promoted to the intendancy of hispaniola which office is next to that of governor he becomes the head of the civil as the governor is of the military department i am much pleased with ottos appointment he is good humored affectionate to america will see things in a friendly light when they admit of it in a rational one always and will not pique himself on writing every trifling circumstance of irritation to his court i wish you to be acquainted with him as a friendly intercourse between individuals who do business together produces a mutual spirit of accommodation useful to both parties it is very much our interest to keep up the affection of this country for us which is considerable a court has no affections but those of the people whom they govern influence their decisions even in the most arbitrary governments—the negociations between the emperor  dutch are spun out to an amazing length at present there is no apprehension but that they will terminate in peace this court seems to press it with ardour and the dutch are averse considering the terms cruel  unjust as they evidently are the present delays therefore are imputed to their coldness  to their forms in the     mean time the turk is delaying the demarcation of limits between him and the emperor is making the most vigorous preparations for war and has composed his ministry of warlike characters deemed personally hostile to the emperor thus time seems to be spinning out both by the dutch  turks  time is wanting for france every years delay is a great thing to her it is not impossible therefore but that she may secretly encourage the delays of the dutch  hasten the preparations of the porte while she is recovering vigour herself and in order to be able to present such a combination to the emperor as may dictate to him to be quiet but the designs of these courts are inscrutable it is our interest to pray that this country may have no continental war till our peace with england is perfectly settled the merchants of this country continue as loud  furious as ever against the arret of august      permitting our commerce with their islands to a certain degree many of them have actually abandoned their trade the ministry are disposed to be firm but there is a point at which they will give way that is if the clamours should become such as to endanger their places it is evident that nothing can be done by us at this time if we may hope it hereafter i like your removal to n york and hope congress will continue there and never execute the idea of building their federal town before it could be finished a change of members in congress or the admission of new states would remove them somewhere else it is evident that when a sufficient number of the western states come in     they will remove it to george town in the mean time it is our interest that it should remain where it is and give no new pretensions to any other place i am also much pleased with the proposition to the states to invest congress with the regulation of their trade reserving its revenue to the states i think it a happy idea removing the only objection which could have been justly made to the proposition the time too is the present before the admission of the western states i am very differently affected towards the new plan of opening our land office by dividing the lands among the states and selling them at vendue it separates still more the interests of the states which ought to be made joint in every possible instance in order to cultivate the idea of our being one nation and to multiply the instances in which the people shall look up to congress as their head and when the states get their portions they will either fool them away or make a job of it to serve individuals proofs of both these practices have been furnished and by either of them that invaluable fund is lost which ought to pay our public debt to sell them at vendue is to give them to the bidders of the day be they many or few it is ripping up the hen which lays golden eggs if sold in lots at a fixed price as first proposed the best lots will be sold first as these become occupied it gives a value to the interjacent ones and raises them tho of inferior quality to the price of the first i send you by mr otto a copy of my book be so good as to apologize to mr thomson for my not sending him one by this conveiance i could not burthen     mr otto with more on so long a road as that from here to lorient i will send him one by a mr williams who will go ere long i have taken measures to prevent its publication my reason is that i fear the terms in which i speak of slavery and of our constitution may produce an irritation which will revolt the minds of our countrymen against reformation in these two articles and thus do more harm than good i have asked of mr madison to sound this matter as far as he can and if he thinks it will not produce that effect i have then copies enough printed to give one to each of the young men at the college and to my friends in the country i am sorry to see a possibility of a ls  being put into the treasury he has no talents for the office and what he has will be employed in rummaging old accounts to involve you in eternal war with r m  and he will in a short time introduce such dissensions into the commission as to break it up if he goes on the other appointment to kaskaskia he will produce a revolt of that settlement from the u s i thank you for your attention to my outfit for the articles of household furniture clothes and a carriage i have already paid   000 livres and have still more to pay for the greatest part of this i have been obliged to anticipate my salary from which however i shall never be able to repay it i find that by a rigid economy bordering however on meanness i can save perhaps  00 a month at least in the summer the residue goes for expences so much of course  of necessity that i cannot avoid them without abandoning all respect to   0 my public character yet i will pray you to touch this string which i know to be a tender one with congress with the utmost delicacy i had rather be ruined in my fortune than in their esteem if they allow me half a years salary as an outfit i can get through my debts in time if they raise the salary to what it was or even pay our house rent  taxes i can live with more decency i trust that mr as house at the hague  dr fs at passy the rent of which had been always allowed him will give just expectations of the same allowance to me mr jay however did not charge it but he lived œconomically and laid up money i will take the liberty of hazarding to you some thoughts on the policy of entering into treaties with the european nations and the nature of them i am not wedded to these ideas and therefore shall relinquish them cheerfully when congress shall adopt others and zealously endeavor to carry theirs into effect first as to the policy of making treaties congress by the confederation have no original and inherent power over the commerce of the states but by the  th article they are authorized to enter into treaties of commerce the moment these treaties are concluded the jurisdiction of congress over the commerce of the states springs into existence and that of the particular states is superseded so far as the articles of the treaty may have taken up the subject there are two restrictions only on the exercise of the power of treaty by congress  st that they shall not by such treaty restrain the legislatures of the states from imposing such duties on foreigners as their own people are subject to  dly nor from prohibiting the     exportation or importation of any particular species of goods leaving these two points free congress may by treaty establish any system of commerce they please but as i before observed it is by treaty alone they can do it though they may exercise their other powers by resolution or ordinance those over commerce can only be exercised by forming a treaty and this probably by an accidental wording of our confederation if therefore it is better for the states that congress should regulate their commerce it is proper that they should form treaties with all nations with whom we may possibly trade you see that my primary object in the formation of treaties is to take the commerce of the states out of the hands of the states and to place it under the superintendence of congress so far as the imperfect provisions of our constitution will admit and until the states shall by new compact make them more perfect i would say then to every nation on earth by treaty your people shall trade freely with us  ours with you paying no more than the most favoured nation in order to put an end to the right of individual states acting by fits and starts to interrupt our commerce or to embroil us with any nation as to the terms of these treaties the question becomes more difficult i will mention three different plans   that no duties shall be laid by either party on the productions of the other   that each may be permitted to equalize their duties to those laid by the other   that each shall pay in the ports of the other such duties only as the most favoured nations pay   were the nations of europe as free and     unembarrassed of established system as we are i do verily believe they would concur with us in the first plan but it is impossible these establishments are fixed upon them they are interwoven with the body of their laws  the organization of their government  they make a great part of their revenue they cannot then get rid of them   the plan of equal imposts presents difficulties insurmountable for how are the equal imposts to be effected is it by laying in the ports of a an equal percent on the goods of b with that which b has laid in his ports on the goods of a but how are we to find what is that percent for this is not the usual form of imposts they generally pay by the ton by the measure by the weight  not by the value besides if a sends a millions worth of goods to b  takes back but the half of that and each pays the same percent it is evident that a pays the double of what he recovers in the same way with b this would be our case with spain shall we endeavour to effect equality then by saying a may levy so much on the sum of bs importations into his ports as b does on the sum of as importations into the ports of b but how find out that sum will either party lay open their custom house books candidly to evince this sum does either keep their books so exactly as to be able to do it this proposition was started in congress when our institutions were formed as you may remember and the impossibility of executing it occasioned it to be disapproved besides who should have a right of deciding when the imposts were equal a would say to b my imposts do not     raise so much as yours i raise them therefore b would then say you have made them greater than mine i will raise mine and thus a kind of auction would be carried on between them and a mutual imitation which would end in anything sooner than equality and right   i confess then to you that i see no alternative left but that which congress adopted of each party placing the other on the footing of the most favoured nation if the nations of europe from their actual establishments are not at liberty to say to america that she shall trade in their ports duty free they may say she may trade there paying no higher duties than the most favoured nation and this is valuable in many of these countries where a very great difference is made between different nations there is no difficulty in the execution of this contract because there is not a merchant who does not know or may not know the duty paid by every nation on every article this stipulation leaves each party at liberty to regulate their own commerce by general rules while it secures the other from partial and oppressive discriminations the difficulty which arises in our case is with the nations having american territory access to the west indies is indispensably necessary to us yet how to gain it when it is the established system of these nations to exclude all foreigners from their colonies the only chance seems to be this our commerce to the mother countries is valuable to them we must endeavor then to make this the price of an admission into their west indies and to those who refuse the admission we must refuse our     commerce or load theirs by odious discriminations in our ports we have this circumstance in our favour too that what one grants us in their islands the others will not find it worth their while to refuse the misfortune is that with this country we gave this price for their aid in the war and we have now nothing more to offer she being withdrawn from the competition leaves gr britain much more at liberty to hold out against us this is the difficult part of the business of treaty and i own it does not hold out the most flattering prospect—i wish you would consider this subject and write me your thoughts on it mr gherry sic wrote me on the same subject will you give me leave to impose on you the trouble of communicating this to him it is long and will save me much labour in copying i hope he will be so indulgent as to consider it as an answer to that part of his letter and will give me his further thoughts on it shall i send you so much of the encyclopedia as is already published or reserve it here till you come it is about  0 vols which probably is about half the work give yourself no uneasiness about the money perhaps i may find it convenient to ask you to pay trifles occasionally for me in america i sincerely wish you may find it convenient to come here the pleasure of the trip will be less than you expect but the utility greater it will make you adore your own country its soil its climate its equality liberty laws people  manners my god how little do my country men know what precious blessings they are in possession of and which no other people on     earth enjoy i confess i had no idea of it myself while we shall see multiplied instances of europeans going to live in america i will venture to say no man now living will ever see an instance of an american removing to settle in europe  continuing there come then  see the proofs of this and on your return add your testimony to that of every thinking american in order to satisfy our countrymen how much it is their interest to preserve uninfected by contagion those peculiarities in their government  manners to which they are indebted for these blessings adieu my dear friend present me affectionately to your collegues if any of them think me worth writing to they may be assured that in the epistolary account i will keep the debit side against them once more adieu june    since writing the above we receive the following account mons pilatre de rosiere who has been waiting some months at boulogne for a fair wind to cross the channel at length took his ascent with a companion the wind changed after a while  brought him back on the french coast being at a height of about  000 f some accident happened to his baloon of inflammable air it burst they fell from that height  were crushed to atoms there was a montgolfier combined with the baloon of inflammable air it is suspected the heat of the montgolfier rarified too much the inflammable air of the other  occasioned it to burst the montgolfier came down in good order     thomas jefferson june         paris mrs john abigail adams to mrs john abigail adams j mss paris june         dear madam — i have received duly the honour of your letter and am now to return you thanks for your condescension in having taken the first steps for settling a correspondence which i so much desired for i now consider it as settled and proceed accordingly i have always found it best to remove obstacles first i will do so therefore in the present case by telling you that i consider your boasts of the splendour of your city and of its superb hackney coaches as a flout and declaring that i would not give the polite selfdenying feeling hospitable goodhumoured people of this country  their amability in every point of view tho it must be confessed our streets are somewhat dirty  our fiacres rather indifferent for ten such races of rich proud hectoring swearing squibbling carnivorous animals as those among whom you are and that i do love this people with all my heart and think that with a better religion a better form of government and their present governors their condition  country would be most enviable i pray you to observe that i have used the term people and that this is a noun of the masculine as well as feminine gender i must add too that we are about reforming our fiacres and that i expect soon an ordnance that all their drivers shall wear breeches unless any difficulty should arise whether this is a subject for the police or for the general legislation of the country to take care of we have lately had an incident of some consequence     as it shews a spirit of treason and audaciousness which was hardly thought to exist in this country some eight or ten years ago a chevalr was sent on a message of state to the princess of—of— of before i proceed an inch further i must confess my profound stupidity for tho i have heard this story told fifty times in all its circumstances i declare i am unable to recollect the name of the ambassador the name of the princess  the nation he was sent to i must therefore proceed to tell you the naked story shorn of all those precious circumstances some chevalier or other was sent on some business or other to some princess or other not succeeding in his negociation he wrote on his return the following song   ennivré du brillant poste   que joccupe récemment   dans une chaise de poste   je me campe fierement   et jevais en ambassade   au mon de mon souverain   dire que je suis malade   et que lui se porte bien   avec une joue enflie   je debarque tout honteux   la princesse pour soufflée   au lieu dune en avoit deux   et son altesse sauvage   sans doute a trouvé mauvais   que jeusse sur mon visage   la moitié de ses attraits   princesse le roi mon maitre   ma pris pour ambassadeur   je viens vous faire connoitre   quelle est pour vous son ardeur   quand vous serier sous le chaume   il donneroit matil dit   la moitié de son royaume   pour celle de votre lit   la princesse à son pupitre   compose un remerciment   elle me donne une spitre   que jemporte lestement   et je men vais dans la rue   fort satisfait d ajouter   a lhonneur de lavoir vue   le plaisir de la quitter this song run thro all companies and was known to everybody a book was afterwards printed with a regular license called les quatres saisons litteraires which being a collection of little things     contained this also and all the world bought it or might buy it if they would the government taking no notice of it it being the office of the journal de paris to give an account and criticism of new publications this book came in turn to be criticised by the redacteur and he happened to select and print in his journal this song as a specimen of what the collection contained he was seized in his bed that night and has been never since heard of our excellent journal de paris then is suppressed and this bold traitor has been in jail now three weeks and for ought any body knows will end his days there thus you see madam the value of energy in government our feeble republic would in such a case have probably been wrapt in the flames of war  desolation for want of a power lodged in a single hand to punish summarily those who write songs the fate of poor pilatre de rosiere will have reached you before this does and with more certainty than we yet know it this will damp for a while the ardor of the phaetons of our race who are endeavoring to learn us the way to heaven on wings of our own i took a trip yesterday to saunois and commenced an acquaintance with the old countess d hocquetout i received much pleasure from it and hope it has opened a door of admission for me to the circle of literati with which she is environed i heard there the nightingale in all its perfection and i do not hesitate to pronounce that in america it would be deemed a bird of the third rank only our mocking bird  foxcoloured thrush being unquestionably superior to it—the squibs against mr adams are such as i expected     from the polished mild tempered truthspeaking people he is sent to it would be ill policy to attempt to answer or refute them but countersquibs i think would be good policy be pleased to tell him that as i had before ordered his madeira frontignac to be forwarded and had asked his orders to mr garvey as to the residue which i doubt not he has given i was afraid to send another order about the bourdeaux lest it should produce confusion in stating my accounts with the united states i am at a loss whether to charge house rent or not it has always been allowed to dr franklin does mr adams mean to charge this for auteuil  london because if he does i certainly will being convinced by experience that my expenses here will otherwise exceed my allowance i ask this information of you madam because i think you know better than mr adams what may be necessary  right for him to do in occasions of this class i will beg the favor of you to present my respects to miss adams i have no secrets to communicate to her in cypher at this moment what i write to mr adams being mere commonplace stuff not meriting a communication to the secretary i have the honor to be with the most perfect esteem dr madam your most obedient  most humble servt thomas jefferson july        paris james monroe to james monroe j mss paris july        dear sir —i wrote you by mr adams may    and by mr otto june    the latter acknowledged   0 the receipt of yours of apr    which is the only one come to hand of later date than dec    little new has occurred since my last peace seems to shew herself under a more decided form the emperor is now on a journey to italy and the two dutch plenipotentiaries have set out for vienna there to make an apology for their state having dared to fire a gun in defence of their invaded rights this is insisted on as a preliminary condition the emperor seems to prefer the glory of terror to that of justice and to satisfy this tinsel passion plants a dagger in the heart of every dutchman which no time will extract i enquired lately of a gentleman who lived long at constantinople in a public character and enjoyed the confidence of that government insomuch as to become well acquainted with it s spirit  it s powers what he thought might be the issue of the present affairs between the emperor  the porte he thinks the latter will not push matters to a war and if they do they must fail under it they have lost their warlike spirit and their troops cannot be induced to adopt the european arms we have no news yet of mr lambe of course our barbary proceedings are still at a stand this will be br you by master franklin he has a separate letter of introduction to you i have never been with him enough to unravel his character with certainty seems to be good in the main but   0 i see sometimes an attempt to keep himself unpenetrated which perhaps is the effect of the old lesson of his grandfather his understanding is good enough for common use but not great enough for uncommon ones however you will     have better opportunity of knowing him the doctor is extremely wounded by the inattention of congress to his application for him he expects something to be done as a reward for his service he will present       a determined silence on this subject in future adieu yours affectionately p s europe fixes an attentive eye on your reception of doct franklin he is infinitely esteemed do not neglect any mark of your approbation which you think          or proper it will honor you here thomas jefferson july        paris mrs sprowle to mrs sprowle jmss paris july        madam —your letter of the   st of june has come safely to hand that which you had done me the honour of writing before has not yet been received having gone by dr witherspoon to america which i had left before his return to it the delay is easily accounted for i wish you may be rightly informed that the property of mr sprowle is yet unsold it was advertised for sale so long ago as to found a presumption that the sale has taken place in any event you may go safely to virginia it is in the london newspapers only that exist those mobs and riots which are fabricated to deter strangers from going to america your person will be sacredly safe  free from insult you can best judge from the character and qualities of your son whether he may be an useful coadjutor     to you there i suppose him to have taken side with the british before our declaration of independence and if this was the case i respect the candour of the measure tho i do not its wisdom a right to take the side which every mans conscience approves in a civil contest is too precious a right and too favourable to the preservation of liberty not to be protected by all its well informed friends the assembly of virginia have given sanction to this right in several of their laws discriminating honourably those who took side against us before the declaration of independence from those who remained among us and strove to injure us by their treacheries i sincerely wish that you  every other to whom this distinction applies favourably may find in the assembly of virginia the good effects of that justice  generosity which have dictated to them this discrimination it is a sentiment which will gain strength in their breasts in proportion as they can forget the savage cruelties committed on them and will i hope in the end induce them to restore the property itself wherever it is unsold and the price received for it where it has been actually sold i am madam your very humble servt thomas jefferson july        paris mrs john abigail adams to mrs john abigail adams j mss paris july        dear madam —i had the honor of writing you on the   st of june but the letter being full of treason has waited a private conveiance since that date there has been received for you at auteuil a cask of about  0 gallons of wine i would have examined     its quality  have ventured to decide on its disposal but it is in a cask within a cask and therefore cannot be got at but by operations which would muddy it and disguise its quality as you probably know what it is what it cost c be so good as to give me your orders on the subject  they shall be complied with since my last i can add another chapter to the history of the redacteur of the journal de paris after the paper had been discontinued about three weeks it appeared again but announcing in the first sentence a changement de domicile of the redacteur the english of which is that the redaction of the paper had been taken from the imprisoned culprit and given to another whether the imprisonment of the former has been made to cease or what will be the last chapter of his history i cannot tell i love energy in government dearly—it is evident it was become necessary on this occasion  that a very daring spirit has lately appeared in this country for notwithstanding the several examples lately made of suppressing the london papers suppressing the leyden gazette imprisoning beaumarchais  imprisoning the redacteur of the journal the author of the mercure of the last week has had the presumption speaking of the german newspapers to say car les journaux de ce pays—la ne sont pas forcés de sen tenir à juger des hemistiches ou à annoncer des programes academiques—probably he is now suffering in a jail the just punishments of his insolent sneer on this mild government tho as yet we do not know the fact     the settlement of the affairs of the abbie mably is likely to detain his friends arnoud  chault in paris the greatest part of the summer it is a fortunate circumstance for me as i have much society with them—what mischief is this which is brewing anew between faneuil hall and the nation of goddemmees will that focus of sedition be never extinguished i apprehend the fire will take thro all the states and involve us again in the displeasure of our mother country thomas jefferson july         paris richard henry lee to richard henry lee j mss paris july         sir —i was honoured two days ago with yours of may    and thank you for the intelligence it contained much of which was new to me it was the only letter i received by this packet except one from mr hopkinson on philosophical subjects i generally write about a dozen by every packet  receive sometimes one sometimes two  sometimes ner a one you are right in supposing all letters opened which come either thro the french or english channel unless trusted to a passenger yours had been evidently opened and i think i never received one through the post office which had not been it is generally discoverable by the smoakiness of the wax  faintness of the reimpression once they sent me a letter open having forgotten to reseal it i should be happy to hear that congress thought of establishing packets of their own between n york and havre to send a packet from each port once in     two months the business might possibly be done by two packets as will be seen by the following scheme wherein we will call the two packets a and b jan a sails from new york b from havre feb mar b new york a havre apr may a new york b havre june july b new york a havre aug sep a new york b havre oct nov b new york a havre dec i am persuaded this government would gladly arrange this matter with us and send their packets in the intermediate months as they are tired of the expence we should then have a safe conveiance every two months  one for common matters every month a courier would pass between this  havre in twentyfour hours could not the surplus of the post office revenue be applied to this this establishment would look like the commencement of a little navy the only kind of force we ought to possess you mention that congress is on the subject of requisition no subject is more interesting to the honour of the states it is an opinion which prevails much in europe that our government wants authority to draw money from the states  that the states want faith to pay their debts i shall wish much to hear how far the requisitions on the states are productive of actual cash mr grand informed me the other day that the commissioners were dissatisfied with his having paid to this country     but  00000 livres of the  00000 for which mr adams drew on holland reserving the residue to replace his advances  furnish current expenses they observe that these last objects might have been effected by the residue of the money in holland which was lying dead mr grands observation to me was that mr adams did not like to draw for these purposes that he himself had no authority and that the commissioners had not accompanied their complaint with any draught on that fund so that the debt still remains unpaid while the money is lying dead in holland he did not desire me to mention this circumstance but should you see the commissioners it might not be amiss to communicate it to them that they may take any measures they please if they think it proper to do anything in it i am anxious to hear what is done with the states of vermont  franklin i think that the former is the only innovation on the system of apr         which ought ever possibly to be admitted if congress are not firm on that head our several states will crumble to atoms by the spirit of establishing every little canton into a separate state i hope virginia will concur in that plan as to her territory south of the ohio  not leave to the western country to withdraw themselves by force  become our worst enemies instead of our best friends europe is likely to be quiet the departure of the dutch deputies for vienna is a proof that matters are arranged between the emperor  dutch the turks shew a disposition to rally against the pursuits of the emperor but if this country can     preserve the peace she will do it she is not ready for war and yet could not see peaceably any new accession of power to him a lover of humanity would wish to see that charming country from which the turks exclude science  freedom in any hands rather than theirs  in those of the native greeks rather than any others the recovery of their antient language would not be desperate could they recover their antient liberty but those who wish to remove the turks wish to put themselves in their places this would be exchanging one set of barbarians for another only—i am sorry to hear your health is not yet established i was in hopes a change of climate would have effected it perhaps the summer of n york may have produced that good effect this will be handed you by monsr houdon the letter which i give him to our delegation will apprise you of his character and mission as well as of the object he would propose with congress i will here only add my request to you personally to render him such civilities as may be convenient and to avail him of those opportunities which are in your power of making him acquainted with the members of congress and of disposing them in his favour he will well merit their notice thomas jefferson july         paris to the virginia delegates in congress j mss paris july         gentlemen —in consequence of the orders of the legislative  executive bodies of virginia i have     engaged monsr houdon to make the statue of genl washington for this purpose it is necessary for him to see the general he therefore goes with doctr franklin  will have the honor of delivering you this himself as his journey is at the expence of the state according to our contract i will pray you to favor him with your patronage  counsels and to protect him as much as possible from those impositions to which strangers are but too much exposed i have advised him to proceed in the stages to the generals i have also agreed if he can see general greene  gates whose busts he has a desire to make that he may make a moderate deviation for this purpose after he is done with general washington but the most important object with him is to be employed to make general washingtons equestrian statue for congress nothing but the expectation of this could have engaged him to have undertaken this voyage the pedestrian statue for virginia will not make it worth the business he loses by absenting himself i was therefore obliged to assure him of my recommendations for this greater work having acted in this for the state you will i hope think yourselves in some measure bound to patronize  urge his being employed by congress i would not have done this myself nor asked you to do it did i not see that it would be better for congress to put this business into his hands than those of any other person living for these reasons   he is without rivalship the first statuary of this age as a proof of which he receives orders from every other country     for things intended to be capital   he will have seen general washington have taken his measures in every part and of course whatever he does of him will have the merit of being original from which other workmen can only furnish copies   he is in possession of the house the furnaces  all the apparatus provided for making the statue of louis xv if any other workman is employed this will all be to be provided anew and of course to be added to the price of the statue for no man can ever expect to make two equestrian statues the addition which this would be to the price will much exceed the expectation of any person who has not seen that apparatus in truth it is immense as to the price of the work it will be much greater than congress is aware of probably i have enquired somewhat into this circumstance and find the prices of those made for two centuries past have been from   0000 guineas down to   000 guineas according to the size and as far as i have seen the smaller they are the more agreeable the smallest yet made is infinitely above the size of the life and they all appear outrée and monstrous that of louis xv is probably the best in the world and it is the smallest here yet it is impossible to find a point of view from which it does not appear a monster unless you go so far as to lose sight of the features and finer lineaments of the face and body a statue is not made like a mountain to be seen at a great distance to perceive those minuter circumstances which constitute its beauty you must be near it and in that case it should be so little above the size of the life as to appear actually   0 of that size from your point of view i should not therefore fear to propose that the one intended by congress should be considerably smaller than any of those to be seen here as i think it will be more beautiful and also cheaper i have troubled you with these observations as they have been suggested to me from an actual sight of works in this kind  supposed they might assist you in making up your minds on this subject in making a contract with monsr houdon it would not be proper to advance money but as his disbursements and labour advance as it is a work of many years this will render the expence insensible the pedestrian statue of marble is to take three years the equestrian of course much more therefore the sooner it is begun the better thomas jefferson july    paris patrick henry to the governor of virginia patrick henry v s a paris july    sir —mr houdons long  desperate illness has retarded till now his departure for virginia and we had hoped from our first conversations with him that it would be easy to make our terms and that the cost of the statue and expence of sending him would be but about a thousand guineas but when we came to settle this precisely he thought himself obliged to ask vastly more insomuch that at one moment we thought our treaty at an end but unwilling to commit such a work to an inferior hand we made him an ultimate proposition on our part he was     as much mortified at the prospect of not being the executor of such a work as we were not to have it done by such a hand he therefore acceded to our terms tho we are satisfied he will be a considerable loser we were led to insist on them because in a former letter to the governor i had given the hope we entertained of bringing the whole within  000 guineas the terms are   000 livres or  000 english guineas the english guinea being worth    livres for the statue  pedistal besides this we pay his expences going  returning which we expect will be between four and five thousand livres and if he dies in the voyage we pay his family  0000 livres this latter proposition was disagreeable to us but he has a father mother  sisters who have no resource but in his labour and he is himself one of the best men in the world he therefore made it a sine qua non without which all would have been off we have reconciled it to ourselves by determining to get insurance on his life made in london which we expect can be done for   per cent so that it becomes an additional sum of  00 livres i have written to mr adams to know for what per cent the insurance can be had i inclose you for a more particular detail a copy of the agreement dr franklin being on his departure did not become a party to the instrumt tho it has been concluded with his approbation he was disposed to give   0 guineas more which would have split the difference between the actual terms  mr houdons demand i wish the state at the conclusion of the work may agree to give him this much more because i am persuaded he will be a loser     which i am sure their generosity would not wish but i have not given him the smallest expectation of it chusing the proposition should come from the state which will be more honourable you will perceive by the agreement that i pay him immediately     ⅓ livres which is to be employed in getting the marble in italy its transportation c the package  transportation of his stucco to make the moulds will be about  00 livres i shall furnish him with money for his expences in france  i have authorised dr franklin when he arrives in philadelphia to draw on me for money for his other expences going staying  returning these draughts will have been made probably  will be on their way to me before you receive this  with the paiments made here will amount to about  000 livres more than the amount of the bill remitted me another third of     ⅓ will become due at the end of the ensuing year dr franklin leaves passy this morning as he travels in a litter mr houdon will follow him some days hence and will embark with him for philadelphia i am in hopes he will not stay in america more than a month thomas jefferson july  0      paris n van staphorst j van staphorst to n and j van staphorst  j mss paris july  0      gentlemen —i received yesterday your favor of the   th supposing that the funds which are the object of your enquiry are those which constitute what we call our domestic debt it is my opinion that     they are absolutely secure i have no doubt at all but that they will be paid with their interest at six per cent but i cannot say that they are as secure and solid as the funds which constitute our foreign debt because no man in america ever entertained a doubt that our foreign debt is to be paid fully but some people in america have seriously contended that the certificates  other evidences of our domestic debt ought to be redeemed only at what they have cost the holder for i must observe to you that these certificates of domestic debt having as yet no provision for the payment either of principal or interest and the original holders being mostly needy they have been sold at a very great discount when i left america july      they sold in different states at from    to    in the pound and any amount of them might then have been purchased hence some thought that full justice would be done if the public paid the purchasers of them what they actually paid for them  interest on that but this is very far from being a general opinion a very great majority being firmly decided that they shall be paid fully were i the holder of any of them i should not have the least fear of their full paiment there is also a difference between different species of certificates some of them being receivable in taxes others having the benefit of particular assurances c again some of these certificates are for paper money debts a deception here must be guarded against congress ordered all such to be resettled by the depreciation tables and a new certificate to be given in exchange for them expressing their value in real     money yet all have not yet been resettled in short this is a science in which few in america are expert and no person in a foreign country can be so foreigners should therefore be sure that they are well advised before they meddle with them or they may suffer if you will reflect with what degree of success persons actually in america could speculate in the european funds which rise and fall daily you may judge how far those in europe may do it in the american funds which are more variable from a variety of causes i am not at all acquainted with mr daniel parker but as having once seen him in philadelphia he is of massachusetts i believe and i am of virginia his circumstances are utterly unknown to me i think there are few men in america if there is a single one who could command a hundred thousand pounds sterlings worth of these notes at their real value at their nominal amount this might be done perhaps with   000£ sterling if the market price of them be as low as when i left america thomas jefferson july         paris john adams to john adams  j mss paris july         dear sir —i was honoured yesterday with yours of the   th instant when the  st article of our instrns of may        was under debate in congress it was proposed that neither party should make the other pay in their ports greater duties than they paid     in the ports of the other one objection to this was its impracticability another that it would put it out of our power to lay such duties on alien importation as might encourage importation by natives some members much attached to english policy thought such a distinction should actually be established some thought the power to do it should be reserved in case any peculiar circumstances should call for it tho under the present or perhaps any probable circumstances they did not think it would be good policy ever to exercise it the footing gentis amicissimæ was therefore adopted as you see in the instruction as far as my inquiries enable me to judge france and holland make no distinction of duties between aliens and natives i also rather believe that the other states of europe make none england excepted to whom this policy as that of her navigation act seems peculiar the question then is should we disarm ourselves of the power to make this distinction against all nations in order to purchase an exception from the alien duties in england only for if we put her importations on the footing of native all other nations with whom we treat will have a right to claim the same i think we should because against other nations who make no distinction in their ports between us  their own subjects we ought not to make a distinction in ours and if the english will agree in like manner to make none we should with equal reason abandon the right as against them i think all the world would gain by setting commerce at perfect liberty i remember this proposition to put foreigners and natives on the same footing was considered and     we were all three dr f as well as you  myself in favor of it we finally however did not admit it partly from the objection you mention but more still on account of our instructions but tho the english proclamation had appeared in america at the time of framing these instructions i think its effect as to alien duties had not yet been experienced  therefore was not attended to if it had been noted in the debate i am sure that the annihilation of our whole trade would have been thought too great a price to pay for the reservation of a barren power which a majority of the members did not propose ever to exercise tho they were willing to retain it stipulating for equal rights for foreigners  natives we obtain more in foreign ports than our instructions required and we only part with in our own ports a power of which sound policy would probably forever forbid the exercise add to this that our treaty will be for a very short term and if any evil be experienced under it a reformation will soon be in our power i am therefore for putting this among our original propositions to the court of london if it should prove an insuperable obstacle with them or if it should stand in the way of a greater advantage we can but abandon it in the course of the negotiation in my copy of the cypher on the alphabetical side numbers are wanting from denmark to disc inclusive and from gone to governor inclusive i suppose them to have been omitted in copying will you be so good as to send them to me from yours by the first safe conveyance     thomas jefferson aug        paris dr richard price to dr richard price j mss paris aug        sir —your favor of july   came duly to hand the concern you therein express as to the effect of your pamphlet in america induces me to trouble you with some observations on that subject from my acquaintance with that country i think i am able to judge with some degree of certainty of the manner in which it will have been received southward of the chesapeak it will find but few readers concurring with it in sentiment on the subject of slavery from the mouth to the head of the chesapeak the bulk of the people will approve it in theory and it will find a respectable minority ready to adopt it in practice a minority which for weight  worth of character preponderates against the greater number who have not the courage to divest their families of a property which however keeps their conscience inquiet northward of the chesapeak you may find here  there an opponent to your doctrine as you may find here  there a robber  a murderer but in no greater number in that part of america there being but few slaves they can easily disencumber themselves of them and emancipation is put into such a train that in a few years there will be no slaves northward of maryland in maryland i do not find such a disposition to begin the redress of this enormity as in virginia this is the next state to which we may turn our eyes for the interesting spectacle of justice in conflict with avarice  oppression a conflict wherein the sacred side is gaining daily recruits from the influx into office of young men grown  growing up     these have sucked in the principles of liberty as it were with their mothers milk and it is to them i look with anxiety to turn the fate of this question be not therefore discouraged what you have written will do a great deal of good and could you still trouble yourself with our welfare no man is more able to give aid to the labouring side the college of william  mary in williamsburg since the remodelling of its plan is the place where are collected together all the young men of virginia under preparation for public life they are there under the direction most of them of a mr wythe one of the most virtuous of characters and whose sentiments on the subject of slavery are unequivocal i am satisfied if you could resolve to address an exhortation to those young men with all that eloquence of which you are master that its influence on the future decision of this important question would be great perhaps decisive thus you see that so far from thinking you have cause to repent of what you have done i wish you to do more and wish it on an assurance of its effect the information i have received from america of the reception of your pamphlet in the different states agrees with the expectations i had formed our country is getting into a ferment against yours or rather has caught it from yours god knows how this will end but assuredly in one extreme or the other there can be no medium between those who have loved so much i think the decision is in your power as yet but will not be so long i pray you to be assured of the sincerity of the esteem  respect with which     i have the honour to be sir your most obedt humble servt thomas jefferson aug         paris john jay to john jay j mss paris aug         dear sir —i shall sometimes ask your permission to write you letters not official but private the present is of this kind and is occasioned by the question proposed in yours of june    whether it would be useful to us to carry all our own productions or none were we perfectly free to decide this question i should reason as follows we have now lands enough to employ an infinite number of people in their cultivation cultivators of the earth are the most valuable citizens they are the most vigorous the most independant the most virtuous  they are tied to their country  wedded to its liberty  interests by the most lasting bonds as long therefore as they can find employment in this line i would not convert them into mariners artisans or anything else but our citizens will find employment in this line till their numbers  of course their productions become too great for the demand both internal  foreign this is not the case as yet  probably will not be for a considerable time as soon as it is the surplus of hands must be turned to something else i should then perhaps wish to turn them to the sea in preference to manufactures because comparing the characters of the two classes i find the former the most valuable citizens i consider the class of artificers as the panders of vice  the instruments by which the liberties of a country   0 are generally overturned however we are not free to decide this question on principles of theory only our people are decided in the opinion that it is necessary for us to take a share in the occupation of the ocean  their established habits induce them to require that the sea be kept open to them and that that line of policy be pursued which will render the use of that element as great as possible to them i think it a duty in those entrusted with the administration of their affairs to conform themselves to the decided choice of their constituents and that therefore we should in every instance preserve an equality of right to them in the transportation of commodities in the right of fishing  in the other uses of the sea but what will be the consequence frequent wars without a doubt their property will be violated on the sea  in foreign ports their persons will be insulted imprisoned c for pretended debts contracts crimes contraband c c these insults must be resented even if we had no feelings yet to prevent their eternal repetition or in other words our commerce on the ocean  in other countries must be paid for by frequent war the justest dispositions possible in ourselves will not secure us against it it would be necessary that all other nations were just also justice indeed on our part will save us from those wars which would have been produced by a contrary disposition but to prevent those produced by the wrongs of other nations by putting ourselves in a condition to punish them weakness provokes insult  injury while a condition to punish it often prevents it this reasoning leads to the     necessity of some naval force that being the only weapon with which we can reach an enemy i think it to our interest to punish the first insult because an insult unpunished is the parent of many others we are not at this moment in a condition to do it but we should put ourselves into it as soon as possible if a war with england should take place it seems to me that the first thing necessary would be a resolution to abandon the carrying trade because we cannot protect it foreign nations must in that case be invited to bring us what we want  to take our productions in their own bottoms this alone could prevent the loss of those productions to us  the acquisition of them to our enemy our seamen might be employed in depredations on their trade but how dreadfully we shall suffer on our coasts if we have no force on the water former experience has taught us indeed i look forward with horror to the very possible case of war with an european power  think there is no protection against them but from the possession of some force on the sea our vicinity to their west india possessions  to the fisheries is a bridle which a small naval force on our part would hold in the mouths of the most powerful of these countries i hope our land office will rid us of our debts  that our first attention then will be to the beginning a naval force of some sort this alone can countenance our people as carriers on the water  i suppose them to be determined to continue such i wrote you two public letters on the   th inst since which i have received yours of july    i shall     always be pleased to receive from you in a private way such communications as you might not chuse to put into a public letter thomas jefferson aug         paris james monroe to james monroe  j mss paris aug         dear sir —i wrote you on the  th of july by mr franklin  on the   th of the same month by monsr houdon since that date yours of june    by mr mazzei is received everything looks like peace here the settlement between the emperor  dutch is not yet published but it is believed to be agreed nothing is done as yet between him  the porte he is much wounded by the confederation of several of the germanic body at the head of which is the king of prussia  to which the king of england as elector of hanover is believed to accede the object is to preserve the constitution of that empire it shews that these princes entertain serious jealousies of the ambition of the emperor and this will very much endanger the election of his nephew as king of the romans a late arret of this court against the admission of british manufactures produces a great sensation in england i wish it may produce a disposition there to receive our commerce in all their dominions on advantageous terms this is the only balm which can heal the wound that it has received it is but too true that that country furnishes market three fourths of the exports of the eight northern most states a truth not proper to be spoken of but which should influence our proceedings with them     how that negotiation advances you are probably better informed than i am the infidelity of the post offices rendering the communication between master adams and myself difficult the improvement of our commerce with france will be advanced more by negotiation at saint james than at versailles the july french packet being arrived without bringing any news of mr lambe if the english one of the same month be also arrived without news of him i expect mr adams will concur with me in sending some other person to treat with the barbary states mr barclay is willing to go  i have proposed him to mr adams but have not yet received his answer the peace expected between spain  algiers will probably not take place it is said the former was to have given a million of dollars would it not be prudent to send a minister to portugal our commerce with that country is very important perhaps more so than with any other country in europe it is possible too that they might permit our whaling vessels to refresh in brazil or give some other indulgence in south america the lethargic character of their ambassador here gives a very unhopeful aspect to a treaty on this ground i lately spoke with him on the subject and he has promised to interest himself in obtaining an answer from his court i have waited to see what was the pleasure of congress as to the secretaryship of my office here that is to see whether they proposed to appoint a secretary of legation or leave me to appoint a private secretary colo humphreys occupation in the dispatches  record of the matters which     relate to the general commissions does not afford him leisure to aid me in my office were i entitled to ask that aid in the meantime the lengthy papers which often accompany the communications between the ministers here  myself  the other business of the office absolutely require a scribe i shall therefore on mr shorts return from the hague appoint him my private secretary till congress shall think proper to signify their pleasure the salary allowed mr franklin in the same office was  000 dollars a year i shall presume that mr short may draw the same allowance from the funds of the n t here as soon as i shall have made this appointment i shall give official notice of it to mr jay that congress may if they disapprove of it say so i am much pleased with your land ordinance  think it improved from the first in the most material circumstances i had mistaken the object of the division of the lands among the states i am sanguine in my expectations of lessening our debts by this fund and have expressed my expectations to the minister  others here i see by the public papers you have adopted the dollar as your money unit in the arrangement of coins i had proposed i ought to have inserted a gold coin of   dollars which being within   of the value of a guinea will be very convenient—the english papers are incessantly repeating their lies about the tumults the anarchy the bankruptcies  distresses of america these ideas prevail very generally in europe at a large table where i dined the other day a gentleman from switzerland expressed his apprehensions for the fate of     doctr franklin as he said he had been informed he would be received with stones by the people who were generally dissatisfied with the revolution  incensed against all those who had assisted in bringing it about i told him his apprehensions were just  that the people of america would probably salute dr franklin with the same stones they had thrown at the marquis fayette the reception of the doctor is an object of very general attention and will weigh in europe as an evidence of the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of america with their revolution as you are to be in williamsburgh early in november this is the last letter i shall write you till about that time i am with very sincere esteem dr sir your friend and servt thomas jefferson sep        paris david hartley to david hartley j mss paris sep        dear sir —your favour of apr    happened to be put into my hands at the same time with a large parcel of letters from america which contained a variety of intelligence it was then put where i usually place my unanswered letters  i from time to time put off acknoleging the receipt of it till i should be able to furnish you american intelligence worth communicating a favourable opportunity by a courier of writing to you occurring this morning what has been my astonishment  chagrin on reading your letter again to find there was a case in it which required an immediate answer but which by the variety of matters which happened to be     presented to my mind at the same time had utterly escaped my recollection i pray you to be assured that nothing but this slip of memory would have prevented my immediate answer  no other circumstance would have prevented its making such an impression on my mind as that it could not have escaped i hope you will therefore obliterate the imputation of want of respect which under actual appearances must have arisen in your mind but which would refer to an untrue cause the occasion of my silence i am not sufficiently acquainted with the proceedings of the new york assembly to say with certainty in what predicament the lands of mr upton may stand but on conferring with colo humphreys who being from the neighboring state was more in the way of knowing what passed in new york he thinks that the descriptions in their confiscation laws were such as not to include a case of this nature the first thing to be done by mr upton is to state his case to some intelligent lawyer of the country that he may know with certainty whether they be confiscated or not  if not confiscated to know what measures are necessary for completing  securing his grant but if confiscated there is then no other tribunal of redress but their general assembly if he is unacquainted there i would advise him to apply to colo hamilton who was aid to genl washington and is now very eminent at the bar and much to be relied on your letter in his favor to mr jay will also procure him the benefit of his council with respect to america i will rather give you a     general view of its situation than merely relate recent events the impost is still unpassed by the two states of new york  rhode island for the manner in which the latter has passed it does not appear to me to answer the principal object of establishing a fund which by being subject to congress alone may give such credit to the certificates of public debt as will make them negotiable this matter then is still suspended congress have lately purchased the indian right to nearly the whole of the land lying in the new state bounded by lake erie pennsylvania  the ohio the northwestern corner alone is reserved to the delawares  wiandots i expect a purchase is also concluded with other tribes for a considerable proportion of the state next to this on the north side of the ohio they have passed an ordinance establishing a land office considerably improved i think on the plan of which i had the honor of giving you a copy the lands are to be offered for sale to the highest bidder for this purpose portions of them are to be proposed in each state that each may have the means of purchase carried equally to their doors  that the purchasers may be a proper mixture of the citizens from all the different states but such lots as cannot be sold for a dollar an acre are not to be parted with they will receive as money the certificates of public debt i flatter myself that this arrangement will very soon absorb the whole of these certificates  thus rid us of our domestic debt which is four fifths of our whole debt our foreign debt will then be a bagatelle     i think it probable that vermont will be made independant as i am told the state of new york is likely to agree to it lemaine will probably in time be also permitted to separate from massachusetts as yet they only begin to think of it whenever the people of kentucky shall have agreed among themselves my friends write me word that virginia will consent to their separation they will constitute the new state on the south side of ohio joining virginia north carolina by an act of their assembly ceded to congress all their lands westward of the alleghany the people inhabiting that territory thereon declared themselves independant called their state by the name of franklin  solicited congress to be received into the union but before congress met n carolina for what reasons i could never learn resumed their cession the people however persist congress recommended to the state to desist from their opposition  i have no doubt they will do it it will therefore result from the act of congress laying off the western country into new states that these states will come into the union in the manner therein provided  without any disputes as to their boundaries i am told that some hostile transaction by our people at the natchez against the spaniards has taken place if it be fact congress will certainly not protect them but leave them to be chastised by the spaniards saving the right to the territory a spanish minister being now with congress  both parties interested in keeping the peace i think if such an event has happened it will be easily arranged     i told you when here of the propositions made by congress to the states to be authorized to make certain regulations in their commerce  that from the disposition to strengthen the hands of congress which was then growing fast i thought they would consent to it most of them did so  i suppose all of them would have done it if they have not actually done it but that events proved a much more extensive power would be requisite congress have therefore desired to be invested with the whole regulation of their trade  forever  to prevent all temptations to abuse  all fears of it they propose that whatever monies shall be levied on commerce either for the purpose of revenue or by way of forfeitures or penalty shall go directly into the coffers of the state wherein it is levied without being touched by congress from the present temper of the states  the conviction which your country has carried home to their minds that there is no other method of defeating the greedy attempts of other countries to trade with them on equal terms i think they will add an article for this purpose to their confederation but the present powers of congress over the commerce of the states under the confederation seems not at all understood by your ministry they say that body has no power to enter into a treaty of commerce why then make one this is a mistake by the  th art of the confederation the states renounce individually all power to make any treaty of whatever nature with a foreign nation by the  th article they give the power of making treaties wholly to congress with two reservations only   that no treaty of   0 commerce shall be made which shall restrain the legislatures from making foreigners pay the same imposts with their own people nor   from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of merchandize which they might think proper were any treaty to be made which should violate either of these two reservations it would be so far void in the treaties therefore made with france holland c this has been cautiously avoided but are these treaties of no advantage to those nations besides the advantages expressly given by them there results another of great value the commerce of those nations with the u s is thereby under the protection of congress  no particular state acting by fits  starts can harass the trade of france holland c by such measures as several of them have practiced against england by loading her merchandize with partial impost refusing admittance to it altogether excluding her merchants c c for you will observe that tho by the  d reservation beforementioned they can prohibit the importation of any species of merchandize as for instance tho they may prohibit the importation of wines in general yet they cannot prohibit that of french wines in particular another advantage is that the nations having treaties with congress can  do provide in such treaties for the admission of their consuls a kind of officer very necessary for the regulation  protection of commerce you know that a consul is the creature of treaty no nation without an agreement can place an officer in another country with any powers or jurisdiction whatever but as the states have     renounced the separate power of making treaties with foreign nations they cannot separately receive a consul  as congress have by the confederation no immediate jurisdiction over commerce as they have only a power bringing that jurisdiction into existence by entering into a treaty till such treaty be entered into congress themselves cannot receive a consul till a treaty then there exists no power in any part of our government federal or particular to admit a consul among us  if it be true as the papers say that you have lately sent one over he cannot be admitted by any power in existence to an exercise of any function nothing less than a new article to be agreed to by all the states would enable congress or the particular states to receive him you must not be surprised then if he be not received i think i have by this time tired you with american politics  will therefore only add assurances of the sincere regard  esteem with which i have the honour to be dr sir your most obedient humble servt thomas jefferson sept  0      paris mary jefferson to mary jefferson  paris sept  0th

aunt to send you to me i know my dear polly how sorry you will be and ought to be to leave them and your cousins but your sister and myself cannot live without you and after a while we will carry you back again to see your friends in virginia in the meantime you shall be taught here to play on the harpsichord to draw to read and talk french and such other things as will make you more worthy of the love of your friends but above all things by our care and love of you we will teach you to love us more than you will do if you stay so far from us i had no opportunity since colonel le maire went to send you anything but when you come here you shall have as many dolls and playthings as you want for yourself or to send to your cousins whenever you shall have opportunities i hope you are a very good girl that you love your uncle and aunt very much and are very thankful to them all for their goodness to you that you never suffer yourself to be angry with any body that you give your playthings to those who want them that you do whatever any body desires of you that is right that you never tell stories never beg for anything mind your books and your work when your aunt tells you never play but when she permits you nor go where she forbids you remember too as a constant charge not to go out without your bonnet because it will make you very ugly and then we shall not love you so much if you always practice these lessons we shall continue to love you as we do now and it is impossible to love     you any more we shall hope to have you with us next summer to find you a very good girl and to assure you of the truth of our affection for you adieu my dear child yours affectionately thomas jefferson sep         paris mrs john abigail adams to mrs john abigail adams paris sep         dear madam —mr shorts return the night before last availed me of your favor of aug    i immediately ordered the shoes you desired which will be ready tomorrow i am not certain whether this will be in time for the departure of mr barclay or of colo franks for it is not yet decided which of them goes to london i have also procured for you three plateaux de dessert with a silvered ballustrade round them and four figures of biscuit the former cost     the latter    each making together   0 livres or  0 louis the merchant undertakes to send them by the way of rouen through the hands of mr garvey  to have them delivered in london there will be some additional expenses of packing transportation  duties here those in england i imagine you can save when i know the amount i will inform you of it but there will be no occasion to remit it here with respect to the figures i could only find three of those you named matched in size these were minerva diana and apollo i was obliged to add a fourth unguided by your choice they offered me a fine venus but i thought it out of taste to have two at table at the same time     paris  helen were represented i conceived it would be cruel to remove them from their peculiar shrine when they shall pass the atlantic it will be to sing a requiem over our freedom  happiness at length a fine mars was offered calm bold his faulchion not drawn but ready to be drawn this will do thinks i for the table of the american minister in london where those whom it may concern may look and learn that though wisdom is our guide and the song and chase our supreme delight yet we offer adoration to that tutelar god also who rocked the cradle of our birth who has accepted our infant offerings  has shown himself the patron of our rights  avenger of our wrongs the group then was closed and your party formed envy  malice will never be quiet i hear it already whispered to you that in admitting minerva to your table i have departed from the principle which made me reject venus in plain english that i have paid a just respect to the daughter but failed to the mother no madam my respect to both is sincere wisdom i know is social she seeks her fellows but beauty is jealous and illy bears the presence of a rival—but allons let us turn over another leaf  begin the next chapter i receive by mr short a budget of london papers they teem with every horror of which human nature is capable assassinations suicides thefts robberies  what is worse than assassination theft suicide or robbery the blackest slanders indeed the man must be of rock who can stand all this to mr adams it will be but one victory the more it would have illy suited me i do not love difficulties i am     fond of quiet willing to do my duty but irritable by slander  apt to be forced by it to abandon my post these are weaknesses from which reason  your counsels will preserve mr adams i fancy it must be the quantity of animal food eaten by the english which renders their character insusceptible of civilization i suspect it is in their kitchens  not in their churches that their reformation must be worked  that missionaries of that description from hence would avail more than those who should endeavor to tame them by precepts of religion or philosophy but what do the foolish printers of america mean by retailing all this stuff in our papers as if it was not enough to be slandered by ones enemies without circulating the slanders among his friends also to show you how willingly i shall ever receive  execute your commissions i venture to impose one on you from what i recollect of the diaper  damask we used to import from england i think they were better  cheaper than here you are well acquainted with those of both countries if you are of the same opinion i would trouble you to send me two sets of tablecloths  napkins for  0 covers each by colo franks or mr barclay who will bring them to me but if you think they can be better got here i would rather avoid the trouble this commission will give i enclose you a specimen of what is offered me at  00 livres for the tablecloth     napkins i suppose that of the same quality a table cloth   aunes wide    aunes long   0 napkins of   aune each would cost   guineas—i shall certainly charge the publick my houserent  court taxes i shall do     more i shall charge my outfit without this i can never get out of debt i think it will be allowed congress is too reasonable to expect where no imprudent expenses are incurred none but those which are required by a decent respect for the mantle with which they cover the public servants that such expences should be left as a burthen on our private fortunes—but when writing to you i fancy myself at auteuil and chatter on till the last page of my paper awakes me from my reverie  tells me it is time to assure you of the sincere respect  esteem with which i have the honor to be dear madam your most obedient  most humble servt ps the cask of wine at auteuil i take chearfully i suppose the seller will apply to me for the price otherwise as i do not know who he is i shall not be able to find him out thomas jefferson oct         paris hogendorp to hogendorp count gysbertcharles van j mss paris oct         dear sir —having been much engaged lately i have been unable sooner to acknolege the receipt of your favor of sep   what you are pleased to say on the subject of my notes is more than they deserve the condition in which you first saw them would prove to you how hastily they had been originally written as you may remember the numerous insertions i had made in them from time to time when i could find a moment for turning to them     from other occupations i have never yet seen monsr de buffon he has been in the country all the summer i sent him a copy of the book  have only heard his sentiments on one particular of it that of the identity of the mammoth  elephant as to this he retains his opinion that they are the same if you had formed any considerable expectations from our revised code of laws you will be much disappointed it contains not more than three of four laws which could strike the attention of the foreigner had it been a digest of all our laws it would not have been comprehensible or instructive but to a native but it is still less so as it digests only the british statutes  our own acts of assembly which are but a supplementary part of our law the great basis of it is anterior to the date of the magna charta which is the oldest statute extant the only merit of this work is that it may remove from our book shelves about twenty folio volumes of our statutes retaining all the parts of them which either their own merit or the established system of laws required you ask me what are those operations of the british nation which are likely to befriend us and how they will produce this effect the british government as you may naturally suppose have it much at heart to reconcile their nation to the loss of america this is essential to the repose perhaps even to the safety of the king  his ministers the most effectual engines for this purpose are the public papers you know well that that government always kept a kind of standing army of news writers who without any regard to truth or to what should be     like truth invented  put into the papers whatever might serve the minister this suffices with the mass of the people who have no means of distinguishing the false from the true paragraphs of a newspaper when forced to acknolege our independance they were forced to redouble their efforts to keep the nation quiet instead of a few of the papers formerly engaged they now engaged every one no paper therefore comes out without a dose of paragraphs against america these are calculated for a secondary purpose also that of preventing the emigrations of their people to america they dwell very much on american bankruptcies to explain these would require a long detail but would shew you that nine tenths of these bankruptcies are truly english bankruptcies in no wise chargeable on america however they have produced effects the most desirable of all others for us they have destroyed our credit  thus checked our disposition to luxury  forcing our merchants to buy no more than they have ready money to pay for they force them to go to those markets where that ready money will buy most thus you see they check our luxury they force us to connect ourselves with all the world  they prevent foreign emigrations to our country all of which i consider as advantageous to us they are doing us another good turn they attempt without disguise to possess themselves of the carriage of our produce  to prohibit our own vessels from participating of it this has raised a general indignation in america the states see however that their constitutions have provided no means of counteracting it they are     therefore beginning to invest congress with the absolute power of regulating their commerce only reserving all revenue arising from it to the state in which it is levied this will consolidate our federal building very much and for this we shall be indebted to the british you ask what i think on the expediency of encouraging our states to be commercial were i to indulge my own theory i should wish them to practise neither commerce nor navigation but to stand with respect to europe precisely on the footing of china we should thus avoid wars and all our citizens would be husbandmen whenever indeed our numbers should so increase as that our produce would overstock the markets of those nations who should come to seek it the farmers must either employ the surplus of their time in manufactures or the surplus of our hands must be employed in manufactures or in navigation but that day would i think be distant and we should long keep our workmen in europe while europe should be drawing rough materials  even subsistence from america but this is theory only  a theory which the servants of america are not at liberty to follow our people have a decided taste for navigation  commerce they take this from their mother country  their servants are in duty bound to calculate all their measures on this datum we wish to do it by throwing open all the doors of commerce  knocking off its shackles but as this cannot be done for others unless they will do it for us  there is no great probability that europe will do this i suppose we   0 shall be obliged to adopt a system which may shackle them in our ports as they do us in theirs with respect to the sale of our lands that cannot begin till a considerable portion shall have been surveyed they cannot begin to survey till the fall of the leaf of this year nor to sell probably till the ensuing spring so that it will be yet a twelvemonth before we shall be able to judge of the efficacy of our land office to sink our national debt it is made a fundamental that the proceeds shall be solely  sacredly applied as a sinking fund to discharge the capital only of the debt it is true that the tobaccos of virginia go almost entirely to england the reason is that they owe a great debt there which they are paying as fast as they can—i think i have now answered your several queries  shall be happy to receive your reflections on the same subjects  at all times to hear of your welfare  to give you assurances of the esteem with which i have the honor to be dear sir your most obedient  most humble servant thomas jefferson oct         paris n van staphorst j van staphorst to n and j van staphorst paris oct         gentlemen —i received yesterday your favor of the  0th inst in order to give you the information you desire on the subject of the liquidated debts of the united states  the comparative footing on which they stand i must observe to you that the first  great division of our federal debt is into   foreign and   domestic the foreign debt comprehends       the loan from the government of spain   the loans from the government of france  from the farmers general   the loans negotiated in holland by orders of congress this branch of our debt stands absolutely singular no man in the united states having ever supposed that congress or their legislatures can in any wise modify or alter it they justly view the united states as the one party  the lenders as the other  that the consent of both would be requisite were any modification to be proposed but with respect to the domestic debt they consider congress as representing both the borrowers  lenders and that the modifications which have taken place in this have been necessary to do justice between the two parties  that they flowed properly from congress as their mutual umpire the domestic debt comprehends   the army debt   the loan office debt   the liquidated debt    the unliquidated debt the  st term includes debts to the officers  souldiers for pay bounty  subsistence the  d term means monies put into the loanoffice of the united states the  d comprehends all debts contracted by quartermasters commissaries  others duly authorized to procure supplies for the army and which have been liquidated that is settled by commissioners appointed under the resolution of congress of june       0 or by the officer who made the contract the  th comprehends the whole mass of debts described in the preceding article which have not yet been liquidated these are in a course of liquidation and are passing over daily into the  d class the debts of this  d class that is the liquidated     debt is the object of your inquiry no time is fixed for the payment of it no fund is yet determined nor any firm provision for the interest in the meantime the consequence is that the certificates of these debts sell greatly below par when i left america they could be bought for from    to    in the pound this difference proceeding from the circumstances of some states having provided for paying the interest on those due in their own state which others had not hence an opinion had arisen with some  propositions had even been made in the legislatures for paying off the principal of these debts with what they had cost the holder  interest on that this opinion is far from being general  i think will not prevail but it is among possible events i have been thus particular that you might be able to judge not only in the present case but also in others should any attempts be made to speculate in your city on these papers it is a business in which foreigners will be in great danger of being duped it is a science which bids defiance to the powers of reason to understand it a man must not only be on the spot and be perfectly possessed of all the circumstances relative to every species of these papers but he must have that dexterity which the habit of buying  selling them alone gives the brokers of these certificates are few in number and any other person venturing to deal with them engages in a very unequal contest     thomas jefferson nov       paris phillip mazzei to phillip mazzei j mss paris nov       dear sir —you desire me to give you an idea of the origin and object of our court of chancery the limits of its jurisdiction and its tendency to render property  liberty more or less secure in a country where that security is infinitely valued the purpose for which you require this obliges me to be concise as indeed does my situation here where as you know i am without books which might enable me to enter into details i shall confine myself therefore to general description only the terms of this if presented to professors of the law would furnish matter for abundant exceptions but these should be suppressed by the reflection that we mean only to sketch for foreigners a general idea of this court the system of law in most of the united states in imitation of that of england is divided into two departments the common law  the chancery the common law is a written law the text of which is preserved from the beginning of the   th century downwards but what has preceded that is lost its substance however has been retained in the memory of the people  committed to writing from time to time in the decisions of the judges and treatises of the jurists insomuch that it is still considered as a lex scripta the letter of which is sufficiently known to guide the decisions of the courts in this department the courts restrain themselves to the letter of the law antiently indeed before the improvement of perhaps the existence of the court of chancery they allowed     themselves greater latitude extending the provisions of every law not only to the cases within its letter but to those also which came within the spirit and reason of it this was called the equity of the law but it is now very long since certainty in the law has become so highly valued by the nation that the judges have ceased to extend the operation of laws beyond those cases which are clearly within the intention of the legislators this intention is to be collected principally from the words of the law only where these are ambiguous they are permitted to gather further evidence from the history of the times when the law was made  the circumstances which produced it in antient times when contracts and transfers of property were more rare and their object more simple the imperfections of this administration of justice according to the letter of the law were less felt but when commerce began to make progress when the transfer of property came into daily use when the modifications of these transfers were infinitely diversified when with the improvement of other faculties that of the moral sense became also improved and learnt to respect justice in a variety of cases which it had not formerly discriminated the instances of injustice left without remedy by courts adhering to the letter of the law would be so numerous as to produce a general desire that a power should be found somewhere which would redress them history renders it probable that appeals were made to the king himself in these cases and that he exercised this power sometimes in person but more generally by his chancellor to whom he referred the     case this was most commonly an ecclesiastic learning being rare in any other class at that time roman learning and a prejudice in favour of roman institutions are known to have been a leading feature in the ecclesiastical character hence it happened that the forms of proceeding in the court of chancery  the rules of its decisions were assimilated to those of the roman law the distinction in that system between the jus prætorium or discretion of the prætor and the general law is well known among the romans  in most modern nations these were  are exercised by the same person but the chancellors of england finding the ordinary courts in possession of the administration of general law  confined to that assumed to themselves by degrees that of the jus prætorium and made theirs be considered as a court of conscience or of equity the history of the struggles between the ordinary or common law courts and the court of equity or chancery would be beyond our purpose it is sufficient to say that the interpositions of the chancellor were at first very rare that they increased insensibly and were rather tolerated from their necessity than authorized by the laws in the earlier periods of history ld bacon first introduced regularity into their proceedings  finch earl of nottingham in the reign of charles the  d opened to view that system which has been improving from that time to this the power of that court as acknowledged at this day is to relieve     where the common law gives no remedy     where its remedy is imperfect        where it would do injustice by comprehending within its letter cases not within its reason nor intended to have been comprehended but this court whilst developing and systematising its powers has found in the jealousy of the nation and its attachment to certain and impartial law an obstacle insuperable beyond that line it has been obliged therefore to establish for itself certain barriers as the limitations of its power which whenever it transcends the general jurisdiction which superintends all the courts  receives appeals from them corrects its encroachments  reverses its decisions this is the house of lords in england and the court of appeals in virginia these limitations are   that it cannot take cognisance of any case wherein the common law can give complete remedy   that it cannot interpose in any case against the express letter and intention of the legislature if the legislature means to enact an injustice however palpable the court of chancery is not the body with whom a correcting power is lodged   that it shall not interpose in any case which does not come within a general description and admit of redress by a general and practicable rule this is to prevent partiality when a chancellor pretends that a case is distinguished from all others it is thought better that that singular case should go without remedy than that he should be at liberty to cover partial decisions under pretence of singular circumstances which ingenious men can always invent hence all the cases remediable in chancery are reduced to certain classes when a new case presents itself not found in any of     these classes it is dismissed as irremediable if in the progress of commerce and of the developments of moral duties the same case is presented so often that the chancellor can seize certain leading features which submit it to a general description and show that it is a proper object for the application of some moral rule—here is a new class of cases formed and brought within the regular relief of the court of chancery which thus continues the administration of justice progressive almost in equal pace with the progress of commerce and refinement of morality one practice only is wanting to render this court completely valuable that is that when a class of cases has been formed  has been the subject of so many decisions in the court of chancery as to have been seen there under all circumstances  in all its combinations and the rules for its decision are modified accordingly  thoroughly digested the legislature should reduce these rules to a text and transplant them into the department of the common law which is competent then to the application of them and is a safer depository for the general administration of justice this would be to make the chancery a nursery only for the forming new plants for the department of the common law much of the business of chancery is now actually in a state of perfect preparation for removal into the common law it has often been predicted in england that the chancery would swallow up the common law during many centuries however that these two courts have gone on together the jurisdiction of the common law has not been narrowed in a single article on the     contrary it has been enlarged from time to time by act of the legislature but jealousy uncorrected by reason or experience sees certainty where ever there is a possibility and sensible men still think that the danger from this court overweighs its utility even some of the states in our union have chosen to do without this court and it has been proposed to others to follow their example in this case one of two consequences must follow either  —the cases now remediable in chancery must be left without remedy in which event the clamorers for justice which originally begat this court would produce its reinstitution or  —the courts of common law must be permitted to perform the discretionary functions of the chancery this will be either by adopting at once all the rules of the chancery with the consent of the legislature or if that is withheld these courts will be led by the desire of doing justice to extend the text of the law according to its equity as was done in england before the chancery took a regular form this will be worse than running on scylla to avoid charybdis for at present nine tenths of our legal contestations are perfectly remedied by the common law  can be carried before that judicature only this proportion then of our rights is placed on sure ground relieve the judges from the rigour of text law and permit them with prætorian discretion to wander into its equity  the whole legal system becomes incertain this has been its fate in every country where the fixed  the discretionary law have been committed into the same hands it is probable that the singular certainty     with which justice has been administered in england has been the consequence of their distribution into two distinct departments unhappily for that country however a very unexpected revolution is working in their laws of late years ld mansfield a man of the clearest head  most seducing eloquence coming from a country where the powers of the common law  chancery are united in the same court has been able since his admission to the bench of judges in england to persuade the courts of common law to revise the practice of construing their text equitably the object of former judges has been to render the law more  more certain that of this personage to render it more incertain under pretence of rendering it more reasonable no period of the english law of what ever length it be taken can be produced wherein so many of its settled rules have been reversed as during the time of this judge his decisions will be precious in those states where no chancery is established but his accession to the bench should form the epoch after which all recurrence to english decisions should be proscribed in those states which have separated the two courts his plan of rendering the chancery useless by administering justice in the same way in the courts of common law has been admirably seconded by the celebrated dr blackstone a judge in the same department who has endeavored seriously to prove that the jurisdiction of the chancery is a chaos irreducible to system insusceptible of fixed rules  incapable of definition or explanation were this true it would be a monster whose existence should not be   0 suffered one moment in a free country wherein every power is dangerous which is not bound up by general rules before i end up my letter i will further observe to guard still more effectually against the dangers apprehended from a court of chancery the legislature of virginia have very wisely introduced into it the trial by jury for all matters of fact i have thus gone over with much rapidity the subject of your inquiries yet i fear i have been more lengthy than you wished you can however extract such of these details as will fulfill your object neglecting those which go beyond it i shall close therefore with assurances of the sincere esteem with which i am dear sir your friend  servant     conference with the count de vergennes on the subject of the commerce of the united states with france       the next levee day at versailles i meant to bring again under the view of the count de vergennes the whole subject of our commerce with france but the number of audiences of ambassadors and other ministers which take place of course before mine and which seldom indeed leave me an opportunity of audience at all prevented me that day i was only able to ask the count de vergennes as a particular favor that he would permit me to wait on him some day that week he did so and i went to versailles the friday following the  th of december m de reyneval was with the count our conversation began with the usual topic that the     trade of the united states had not yet learned the way to france but continued to centre in england though no longer obliged by law to go there i observed that the real cause of this was to be found in the difference of the commercial arrangements in the two countries that merchants would not and could not trade but where there was to be some gain that the commerce between two countries could not be kept up but by an exchange of commodities that if an american merchant was forced to carry his produce to london it could not be expected he would make a voyage from thence to france with the money to lay it out here and in like manner that if he could bring his commodities with advantage to this country he would not make another voyage to england with the money to lay it out there but would take in exchange the merchandise of this country the count de vergennes agreed to this and particularly that where there was no exchange of merchandise there could be no durable commerce and that it was natural for merchants to take their returns in the port where they sold their cargo i desired his permission then to take a summary view of the productions of the united states that we might see which of them could be brought here to advantage   rice france gets from the mediterranean a rice not so good indeed but cheaper than ours he said that they bought of our rice but that they got from egypt also rice of a very fine quality i observed that such was the actual state of their commerce in that article that they take little from us   indigo they make a plenty in their own     colonies he observed that they did and that they thought it better than ours   flour fish and provisions of all sorts they produce for themselves that these articles might therefore be considered as not existing for commerce between the united states and the kingdom of france i proceeded to those capable of becoming objects of exchange between the two nations   peltry and furs our posts being in the hands of the english we are cut off from that article i am not sure even whether we are not obliged to buy of them for our own use when these posts are given up if ever they are we shall be able to furnish france with skins and furs to the amount of two millions of livres in exchange for her merchandise but at present these articles are to be counted as nothing   potash an experiment is making whether this can be brought here we hope it may but at present it stands for nothing he observed that it was much wanted in france and he thought it would succeed   naval stores trials are also making on these as subjects of commerce with france they are heavy and the voyage long the result therefore is doubtful at present they are as nothing in our commerce with this country   whale oil i told him i had great hopes that the late diminution of duty would enable us to bring this article with advantage to france that a merchant was just arrived mr barrett who proposed to settle at lorient for the purpose of selling the cargoes of this article and choosing the returns that he had informed me that in the first year it would be necessary     to take onethird in money and the remainder only in merchandise because the fishermen require indispensably some money but he thought that after the first year the merchandise of the preceding year would always produce money for the ensuing one and that the whole amount would continue to be taken annually afterwards in merchandise i added that though the diminution of duty was expressed to be but for one year yet i hoped they would find their advantage in renewing and continuing it for that if they intended really to admit it for one year only the fishermen would not find it worth while to rebuild their vessels and to prepare themselves for the business the count expressed satisfaction on the view of commercial exchange held up by this article he made no answer as to the continuance of it and i did not choose to tell him at that time that we should claim its continuance under their treaty with the hanseatic towns which fixes this duty for them and our own treaty which gives us the rights of the most favored nation   tobacco i recalled to the memory of the count de vergennes the letter i had written to him on this article and the object of the present conversation being how to facilitate the exchange of commerciable articles between the two countries i pressed that of tobacco in this point of view observed that france at present paid us two millions of livres for this article that for such portions of it as were bought in london they sent the money directly there and for what they bought in the united states the money was still remitted to london by bills of     exchange whereas if they would permit our merchants to sell this article freely they would bring it here and take the returns on the spot in merchandise not money the count observed that my proposition contained what was doubtless useful but that the king received on this article at present a revenue of twentyeight millions which was so considerable as to render them fearful of tampering with it that the collection of this revenue by way of farm was of very ancient date and that it was always hazardous to alter arrangements of long standing and of such infinite combinations with the fiscal system i answered that the simplicity of the mode of collection proposed for this article withdrew it from all fear of deranging other parts of their system that i supposed they would confine the importation to some of their principal ports probably not more than five or six that a single collector in each of these was the only new officer requisite that he could get rich himself on six livres a hogshead and would receive the whole revenue and pay it into the treasury at short hand m de reyneval entered particularly into this part of the conversation and explained to the count more in detail the advantages and simplicity of it and concluded by observing to me that it sometimes happened that useful propositions though not practicable at one time might become so at another i told him that that consideration had induced me to press the matter when i did because i had understood the renewal of the farm was then on the carpet and that it was the precise moment when i supposed that this     portion might be detached from the mass of the farms i asked count de vergennes whether if the renewal of the farm was pressing this article might not be separated merely in suspense till government should have time to satisfy themselves on the expediency of renewing it he said no promises could be made in the course of this conversation he had mentioned the liberty we enjoyed of carrying our fish to the french islands i repeated to him what i had hinted in my letter of november the  0th      that i considered as a prohibition the laying such duties on our fish and giving such premiums on theirs as made a difference between their and our fishermen of fifteen livres the quintal in an article which sold for but fifteen livres he said it would not have that effect for two reasons   that their fishermen could not furnish supplies sufficient for their islands and of course the inhabitants must of necessity buy our fish   that from the constancy of our fishery and the short season during which theirs continued and also from the economy and management of ours compared with the expense of theirs we had always been able to sell our fish in their islands at twentyfive livres the quintal while they were obliged to ask thirtysix livres i suppose he meant the livre of the french islands that thus the duty and premium had been a necessary operation on their side to place the sale of their fish on a level with ours and that without this theirs could not bear the competition i have here brought together the substance of     what was said on the preceding subjects not pretending to give it verbatim which my memory does not enable me to do i have probably omitted many things which were spoken but have mentioned nothing which was not it was interrupted at times with collateral matters one of these was important the count de vergennes complained and with a good deal of stress that they did not find a sufficient dependence on arrangements taken with us this was the third time too he had done it first in a conversation at fontainebleau when he first complained to me of the navigation acts of massachusetts and new hampshire secondly in his letter of october the  0th      on the same subject and now in the present conversation wherein he added as another instance the case of the chevalier de mezieres heir of general oglethorpe who notwithstanding that the   th article of the treaty provides that the subjects or citizens of either party shall succeed ab intestato to the lands of their ancestors within the dominions of the other had been informed from mr adams and by me also that his right of succession to the generals estate in georgia was doubtful he observed too that the administration of justice with us was tardy insomuch that their merchants when they had money due to them within our states considered it as desperate and that our commercial regulations in general were disgusting to them these ideas were new serious and delicate i decided therefore not to enter into them at that moment and the rather as we were speaking in french in which language i did     not choose to hazard myself i withdrew from the objections of the tardiness of justice with us and the disagreeableness of our commercial regulations by a general observation that i was not sensible they were well founded with respect to the case of the chevalier de mezieres i was obliged to enter into some explanations they related chiefly to the legal operation of our declaration of independence to the undecided question whether our citizens and british subjects were thereby made aliens to one another to the general laws as to the conveyances of land to aliens and the doubt whether an act of the assembly of georgia might not have been passed to confiscate general oglethorpes property which would of course prevent its devolution on any heir mr reyneval observed that in this case it became a mere question of fact whether a confiscation of these lands had taken place before the death of general oglethorpe which fact might be easily known by inquiries in georgia where the possessions lay i thought it very material that the opinion of this court should be set to rights on these points on my return therefore i wrote the following observations on them which the next time i went to versailles not having an opportunity of speaking to the count de vergennes i put into the hands of m reyneval praying him to read them and to ask the favor of the count to do the same explanations on some of the subjects of conversation which i had the honor of having with his excellency the count de vergennes when i was last at versailles     the principal design of that conversation was to discuss those articles of commerce which the united states could spare which are wanted in france and if received there on a convenient footing would be exchanged for the productions of france but in the course of the conversation some circumstances were incidentally mentioned by the count de vergennes which induced me to suppose he had received impressions neither favorable to us nor derived from perfect information the case of the chevalier de mezieres was supposed to furnish an instance of our disregard of treaties and the event of that case was inferred from opinions supposed to have been given by mr adams and myself this is ascribing a weight to our opinions to which they are not entitled they will have no influence on the decision of the case the judges in our courts would not suffer them to be read their guide is the law of the land of which law its treaties make a part indeed i know not what opinion mr adams may have given on the case and if any be imputed to him derogatory of our regard to the treaty with france i think his opinion has been misunderstood with respect to myself the doubts which i expressed to the chevalier de mezieres as to the success of his claims were not founded on any question whether the treaty between france and the united states would be observed on the contrary i venture to pronounce that it will be religiously observed if his case comes under it but i doubted whether it would come under the treaty the case as i understand it is this general   0 oglethorpe a british subject had lands in georgia he died since the peace having devised these lands to his wife his heirs are the chevalier de mezieres son of his elder sister and the marquis de belgarde son of his younger sister this case gives rise to legal questions some of which have not yet been decided either in england or america the laws of which countries are nearly the same   it is a question under the laws of those countries whether persons born before their separation and once completely invested in both with the character of natural subjects can ever become aliens in either there are respectable opinions on both sides if the negative be right then general oglethorpe having never become an alien and having devised his lands to his wife who on this supposition also was not an alien the devise has transferred the lands to her and there is nothing left for the treaty to operate on   if the affirmative opinion be right and the inhabitants of great britain and america born before the revolution are become aliens to each other it follows by the laws of both that the lands which either possessed within the jurisdiction of the other became the property of the state in which they are but a question arises whether the transfer of the property took place on the declaration of independence or not till an office or an act of assembly had declared the transfer if the property passed to the state on the declaration of independence then it did not remain in general oglethorpe and of course at the time of his death he having nothing     there was nothing to pass to his heirs and so nothing for the treaty to operate on   if the property does not pass till declared by an office found by jury or an act passed by the assembly the question then is whether an office had been found or an act of assembly been passed for that purpose before the peace if there was the lands had passed to the state during his life and nothing being left in him there is nothing for his heirs to claim under the treaty   if the property had not been transferred to the state before the peace either by the declaration of independence or an office or an act of assembly then it remained in general oglethorpe at the epoch of the peace and it will be insisted no doubt that by the sixth article of the treaty of peace between the united states and great britain which forbids future confiscations general oglethorpe acquired a capacity of holding and of conveying his lands he has conveyed them to his wife but she being an alien it will be decided by the laws of the land whether she took them for her own use or for the use of the state for it is a general principle of our law that conveyances to aliens pass the lands to the state and it may be urged that though by the treaty of peace general oglethorpe could convey yet that treaty did not mean to give him a greater privilege of conveyance than natives hold to wit a privilege of transferring the property to persons incapable by law of taking it however this would be a question between the state of georgia and the widow of general oglethorpe in the     decision of which the chevalier de mezieres is not interested because whether she takes the land by the will for her own use or for that of the state it is equally prevented from descending to him there is neither a conveyance to him nor a succession ab intestato devolving on him which are the cases provided for by our treaty with france to sum up the matter in a few words if the lands had passed to the state before the epoch of peace the heirs of general oglethorpe cannot say they have descended on them and if they remained in the general at that epoch the treaty saving them to him he could convey them away from his heirs and he has conveyed them to his widow either for her own use or for that of the state seeing no event in which according to the facts stated to me the treaty could be applied to this case or could give any right whatever to the heirs of general oglethorpe i advised the chevalier de mezieres not to urge his pretensions on the footing of right nor under the treaty but to petition the assembly of georgia for a grant of these lands if in the question between the state and the widow of general oglethorpe it should be decided that they were the property of the state i expected from their generosity and the friendly disposition in america to the subjects of france that they would be favorable to the chevalier de mezieres there is nothing in the preceding observations which would not have applied against the heir of general oglethorpe had he been a native citizen of georgia as it now applies against him being a subject of france the treaty has placed the subjects of     france on a footing with natives as to conveyances and descent of property there was no occasion for the assemblies to pass laws on this subject the treaty being a law as i conceive superior to those of particular assemblies and repealing them when they stand in the way of its operations the supposition that the treaty was disregarded on our part in the instance of the acts of assembly of massachusetts and new hampshire which made a distinction between natives and foreigners as to the duties to be paid on commerce was taken notice of in the letter of november the  0th which i had the honor of addressing to the count de vergennes and while i express my hopes that on a revision of these subjects nothing will be found in them derogatory from either the letter or spirit of our treaty i will add assurances that the united states will not be behind hand in going beyond both whenever occasion shall offer of manifesting their sincere attachment to this country i will pass on to the observation that our commercial regulations are difficult and repugnant to the french merchants to detail these regulations minutely as they exist in every state would be beyond my information a general view of them however will suffice because the states differ little in their several regulations on the arrival of a ship in america her cargo must be reported at the proper office the duties on it are to be paid these are commonly from two and a half to five per cent on its value on many articles the value of which is tolerably uniform the precise sum is fixed by law     a tariff of these is presented to the importer and he can see what he has to pay as well as the officer for other articles the duty is such a per cent on their value that value is either shown by the invoice or by the oath of the importer this operation being once over and it is a very short one the goods are considered as entered and may then pass through the whole thirteen states without their being ever more subject to a question unless they be reshipped exportation is still more simple because as we prohibit the exportation of nothing and very rarely lay a duty on any article of export the state is little interested in examining outwardbound vessels the captain asks a clearance for his own purposes as to the operations of internal commerce such as matters of exchange of buying selling bartering c our laws are the same as the english if they have been altered in any instance it has been to render them more simple lastly as to the tardiness of the administration of justice with us it would be equally tedious and impracticable for me to give a precise account of it in every state but i think it probable that it is much on the same footing through all the states and that an account of it in any one of them may found a general presumption of it in the others being best acquainted with its administration in virginia i shall confine myself to that before the revolution a judgment could not be obtained under eight years in the supreme court where the suit was in the department of the common law which department embraces about ninetenths of the subject     of legal contestation in that of the chancery from twelve to twenty years were requisite this did not proceed from any vice in the laws but from the indolence of the judges appointed by the king and these judges holding their office during his will only he could have reformed the evil at any time this reformation was among the first works of the legislature after our independence a judgment can now be obtained in the supreme court in one year at the common law and in about three years in the chancery but more particularly to protect the commerce of france which at that moment was considerable with us a law was passed giving all suits wherein a foreigner was a party a privilege to be tried immediately on the return of his process without waiting till those of natives which stand before them shall have been decided on out of this act however the british stand excluded by a subsequent one this with its causes must be explained the british army after ravaging the state of virginia had sent off a very great number of slaves to new york by the seventh article of the treaty of peace they stipulated not to carry away any of these notwithstanding this it was known when they were evacuating new york that they were carrying away the slaves general washington made an official demand of sir guy carleton that he should cease to send them away he answered that these people had come to them under promise of the kings protection and that that promise should be fulfilled in preference to the stipulation in the treaty the state of virginia to     which nearly the whole of these slaves belonged passed a law to forbid the recovery of debts due to british subjects they declared at the same time they would repeal the law if congress were of opinion they ought to do it but desirous that their citizens should be discharging their debts they afterwards permitted british creditors to prosecute their suits and to receive their debts in seven equal and annual payments relying that the demand for the slaves would be either admitted or denied in time to lay their hands on some of the latter payments for reimbursement the immensity of this debt was another reason for forbidding such a mass of property to be offered for sale under execution at once as from the small quantity of circulating money it must have sold for little or nothing whereby the creditor would have failed to receive his money and the debtor would have lost his whole estate without being discharged of his debt this is the history of the delay of justice in that country in the case of british creditors as to all others its administration is as speedy as justice itself will admit i presume it is equally so in all the other states and can add that it is administered in them all with a purity and integrity of which few countries can afford an example i cannot take leave altogether of the subjects of this conversation without recalling the attention of the count de vergennes to what had been its principal drift this was to endeavor to bring about a direct exchange between france and the united states without the intervention of a third nation of those productions with which each could furnish     the other we can furnish to france because we have heretofore furnished to england of whale oil and spermaceti of furs and peltry of ships and naval stores and of potash to the amount of fifteen millions of livres and the quantities will admit of increase of our tobacco france consumes the value of ten millions more twentyfive millions of livres then mark the extent of that commerce of exchange which is at present practicable between us we want in return productions and manufactures not money if the duties on our produce are light and the sale free we shall undoubtedly bring it here and lay out the proceeds on the spot in the productions and manufactures which we want the merchants of france will on their part become active in the same business we shall no more think when we shall have sold our produce here of making an useless voyage to another country to lay out the money than we think at present when we have sold it elsewhere of coming here to lay out the money the conclusion is that there are commodities which form a basis of exchange to the extent of a million of guineas annually it is for the wisdom of those in power to contrive that the exchange shall be made having put this paper into the hands of monsieur reyneval we entered into conversation again on the subject of the farms which were now understood to be approaching to a conclusion he told me that he was decidedly of opinion that the interest of the state required the farm of tobacco to be discontinued and that he had accordingly given     every aid to my proposition which laid within his sphere that the count de vergennes was very clearly of the same opinion and had supported it strongly with reasons of his own when he transmitted it to the comptroller general but that the comptroller in the discussions of this subject which had taken place besides the objections which the count de vergennes had repeated to me and which are before mentioned had added that the contract with the farmers general was now so far advanced that the article of tobacco could not be withdrawn from it without unravelling the whole transaction having understood that in this contract there was always reserved to the crown a right to discontinue it at any moment making just reimbursements to the farmers i asked m reyneval if the contract should be concluded in its present form whether it might still be practicable to have it discontinued as to the article of tobacco at some future moment he said it might be possible upon the whole the true obstacle to this proposition has penetrated in various ways through the veil which covers it the influence of the farmers general has been heretofore found sufficient to shake a minister in his office monsieur de calonnes continuance or dismission has been thought for some time to be on a poise were he to shift this great weight therefore out of his own scale into that of his adversaries it would decide their preponderance the joint interests of france and america would be insufficient counterpoise in his favor it will be observed that these efforts to improve     the commerce of the united states have been confined to that branch only which respects france itself and that nothing passed on the subject of our commerce with the west indies except an incidental conversation as to our fish the reason of this was no want of a due sense of its importance of that i am thoroughly sensible but efforts in favor of this branch would at present be desperate to nations with which we have not yet treated and who have possessions in america we may offer a free vent of their manufactures in the united states for a full or modified admittance into those possessions but to france we are obliged to give that freedom for a different compensation to wit for her aid in effecting our independence it is difficult therefore to say what we have now to offer to her for an admission into her west indies doubtless it has its price but the question is what this would be and whether worth our while to give it were we to propose to give to each others citizens all the rights of natives they would of course count what they should gain by this enlargement of right and examine whether it would be worth to them as much as their monopoly of their west india commerce if not that commercial freedom which we wish to preserve and which indeed is so valuable leaves us little to offer an expression in my letter to the count de vergennes of november the  0th wherein i hinted that both nations might perhaps come into the opinion that the condition of natives might be a better ground of intercourse for their citizens than that of the most favored  00 nation was intended to furnish on opportunity to the minister of parleying on that subject if he was so disposed and to myself of seeing whereabouts they would begin that i might communicate it to congress and leave them to judge of the expediency of pursuing the subject but no overtures have followed for i have no right to consider as coming from the minister certain questions which were very soon after proposed to me by an individual it sufficiently accounts for these questions that that individual had written a memorial on the subject for the consideration of the minister and might wish to know what we would be willing to do the idea that i should answer such questions to him is equally unaccountable whether we suppose them originating with himself or coming from the minister in fact i must suppose them to be his own and i transmit them only that congress may see what one frenchman at least thinks on the subject if we can obtain from great britain reasonable conditions of commerce which in my idea must forever include an admission into her islands the freest ground between these two nations would seem to be the best but if we can obtain no equal terms from her perhaps congress might think it prudent as holland has done to connect us unequivocally with france holland has purchased the protection of france the price she pays is aid in time of war it is interesting for us to purchase a free commerce with the french islands but whether it is best to pay for it by aids in war or by privileges in commerce or not to purchase it at all is the question  0  correspondence

tread in buskins so that half ones friends might be dead without its being ever spoken of here your letter was handed me by mr littlepage whom i have never seen before and who set out from home for warsaw after two or three days stay i observe by the public papers that he has brought on a very disagreeable altercation with mr jay in which he has given to the character of the latter a colouring which does not belong to it these altercations little thought of in america make a great impression here in truth it is afflicting that a man who has past his life in serving the public who has served them in every the highest stations with universal approbation and with a purity of conduct which has silenced even party opprobrium who tho poor has never permitted  0  himself to make a shilling in the public employ should yet be liable to have his peace of mind so much disturbed by any individual who shall think proper to arraign him in a newspaper it is however an evil for which there is no remedy our liberty depends on the freedom of the press and that cannot be limited without being lost to the sacrifice of time labor fortune a public servant must count upon adding that of peace of mind and even reputation and all this is preferable to european bondage he who doubts it need only be placed for one week on any part of the continent of europe your desire of possessing the new encyclopedie was expressed so problematically in a former letter that i doubted whether you did not merely render yourself thro complaisance to my proposition your last letter however is more explicit

paris january         sir —i have been honored with your excellencys two letters of sept  0th and that of oct   th      the former were brought me by mr houdon who is returned with the necessary moulds and measures for general washingtons statue i fear the expences of his journey have been considerably increased by the unlucky accident of his tools materials clothes c not arriving at havre in time to go with him to america so that he had to supply himself there the money which you were so kind as to send by captain littlepage for the purpose of this statue he found himself obliged to deposite in new york to satisfy a demand made upon him there this was a debt which he owed to mr jay he assures me that in a settlement with his guardian the latter took credit for this debt so as to be answerable to mr jay for it and of course to the state now that mr jay is paid with the states money i  0  mention this circumstance that your excellency may be enabled to take the earliest measures for recovering this money and indemnifying the state mr littlepage to satisfy me had obtained from the m de la fayette his engagement to stand bound as mr littlepages security for the paiment of this money but knowing the punctuality and responsibility of his guardian i did not suppose a security necessary besides if a loss were to be incurred i know too well the sentiments of the state of virginia towards m de la fayette to suppose they would be willing to throw that loss on him i therefore acted as i thought your excellency and the council would have directed me to act could you have been consulted i waited on the marquis and in his presence cancelled his name from the obligation which had been given me leaving only that of mr littlepage i have now the honor to enclose you one of those instruments duplicates of which had been given me by mr littlepage the first of the marquiss busts will be finished next month i shall present that one to the city of paris because the delay has been noticed by some i hope to be able to send another to virginia in the course of the summer these are to cost three thousand livres each the agreement for the arms has been at length concluded by mr barclay he was so much better acquainted with this business than the marquis fayette or myself that we left it altogether with him we were sensible that they might have been got cheaper but not so good however i suppose he has given you the details of his proceedings so as to  0  render them unnecessary from me it will be eight months before they will be ready the cause of this too mr barclay told me he would explain to you it is principally to ensure their goodness the bills remitted to pay for them have been honoured and the money is lodged in mr grands hands who is willing to allow a small interest for it an improvement is made here in the construction of the musket which may be worthy of attention it consists in making every part of them so exactly alike that every part of every one may be used for the same part in any other musket made by the same hand the government here has examined and approved the method and is establishing a large manufactory for the purpose as yet the inventor has only completed the lock of the musket on this plan he will proceed immediately to have the barrel stock and their parts executed in the same way i visited the workman he presented me the parts of  0 locks taken to pieces and arranged in compartments i put several together myself taking the pieces at hazard as they came to hand and found them to fit interchangeably in the most perfect manner the tools by which he effects this have at the same time so abridged the labour that he thinks he shall be able to furnish the musket two livres cheaper than the kings price but it will be two or three years before he will be able to finish any quantity i have duly received the propositions of messrs ross pleasants  co for furnishing tobacco to the farmers general but mr morris had in the meantime obtained the contract i have been fully  0  sensible of the baneful influence on the commerce of france and america which this double monopoly will have i have struck at its root here and spared no pains to have the farm itself demolished but it has been in vain the persons interested in it are too powerful to be opposed even by the interest of the whole country i mention this matter in confidence as a knowledge of it might injure any future endeavors to attain the same object everything is quiet here and will certainly remain so another year mr barclay left paris a few days ago and will be absent from france for some time i shall spare no endeavors to fulfill the several objects with which he was charged in the best manner i can end of volume iv   art  —t j   art  —t j   art

actually passed by writing to different friends in reply to one of these inquiries archibald stuart wrote him sparks mss harvard college from staunton sept        dear sir—i presume you have seen mr wirts sketches of the life of patrick henry and that he denies mr h favored the project of establishing a dictator during the revolutionary war—even doubts respecting events of such recent date tend greatly to impair the credit of history there are many living now who witnessed the part mr henry took on that subject—after the assembly was dispersed at charlottesville in the year      it met in staunton where mr geo nicholas a member of that body proposed that a dictator be established in this commonwealth who should have the power of disposing of the lives and fortunes of the citizens thereof without being subject to account—in support of this resolution he observed that the country was overrum by the enemy and that the operation of the govt was nearly suspended—that although the powers proposed to be conferred were very great the character he proposed to fill the office would remove all apprehensions arising from the abuse of them—that this character was genl washington—that he was our fellow citizen that we had a right to command his services and that he had no doubt but that on such an occasion he would obey the call of his country—in the course of his speech he refered to the practice of the romans on similar occasions after mr nicholas sat down mr henry addressed the chair he observed it was immaterial to him whether the officer proposed was called a dictator or a governor with enlarged powers or by any other name yet surely an officer armed with such powers was necessary to restrain the unbridled fury of a licentious enemy and concluded by seconding the motion— on the other hand it was contended by mann page from spottsylvania and several other members—that our affairs were not desperate that the pressure we felt was but temporary that the govt was still efficient that the spirit of the people was unbroken that it was unbecoming in their representatives to damp their ardor by an act of despair—that they had equal confidence with the mover of the resolution in the integrity of genl washington but that he nor no other man ought to be armed with such unlimited powers—that they well know he would not accept the office—that if he was willing to accept it he was better employed at the head of the army than in the exercise of powers which would render him odious to the people—after a lengthy discussion the proposition was negatived— i was present at this discussion and could easily discover that the proposition was not relished by the people their feelings were of a different character had the enemy advanced they would have risen in

life has begotten a depravity of morals a dependence and corruption which renders them an undesirable accession to a country whose morals are sound my expressions look forward to the time when our own great cities would get into the same state but they have been quoted as if meant for the present time here as yet our manufactures are as much at their ease as independent and moral as our agricultural habits and they will continue so as long as there are vacant lands for them to resort to because whenever it shall be attempted by the other classes to reduce them to the minimum of subsistence they will quit their trades and go to laboring the earth a first question is whether it is desirable for us to receive at present the dissolute and demoralized handicraftsmen of the old cities of europe a second and more difficult one is when even good handicraftsmen arrive here is it better for them to set up their trade or go to the culture of the earth whether their labor in their

jeffersons secretary at this time it leaves little doubt as to who is intended        in cipher it almost certainly alludes to adams though the editor of the madison letters i    infers that arthur

instant till i could obtain the sense of congress on the matter it contains i conceive it hardly possible while the british cruisers retain their present station for you to elude their vigilance in either of the ships offered to your choice this concurring with the late advices from england has induced congress to pass the enclosed resolution the resolution enclosed was february         that the secretary for foreign affairs inform mr jefferson that it is the pleasure of congress considering the advices lately received in america and the probable situation of affairs in europe that he do not proceed on his intended voyage until he shall receive their further instructions   to this livingston replied philadelphia   th february      sir—i was honoured yesterday with your favour of the   th which i shall lay before congress this morning as you have by this time received their resolution which i had the honour to send you by the last post and again enclose you will be relieved in some measure from your embarrasments tho not entirely from your suspense with respect to their final determination but that cannot be long doubtful since the negotiations have certainly arrived at such a crisis as either to terminate soon in a peace or a total rupture in the latter case you will necessarily be obliged to proceed on your voyage as congress seems anxious to avail themselves of your abilities and information in the negotiations unless they are fully assured that a speedy peace will preclude them from that advantage   the parts in italics are in cipher in the original   from randalls life of jefferson iii       the following resolution was passed by congress in response to this letter april  st      resolved that the secretary for foreign affairs inform the hon thomas jefferson in answer to his letter of the   th of march that congress consider the object of his appointment so far advanced as to render it unnecessary for him to pursue his voyage and that congress are well satisfied with the readiness he has shown in undertaking a service which from the present situation of affairs they apprehend can be dispensed with   this is copied from jeffersons rough draft and the portions in italics are underlined in the original evidently to indicate words that were to be put in cipher   this i infer to be an allusion to miss floyd whom madison was then courting but the allusion is so veiled as to be undecipherable   jeffersons dislike of the virginia constitution of      has already        been alluded to from its adoption he was always endeavoring to obtain a convention to frame a new one and on his spending a day in richmond at the opening of the spring session of the legislature in      he found such a convention a subject of discussion he wrote madison the day after this visit may        all the powers of his thomson mason mind seem at present concentrated in one single object the producing of a convention to new model the constitution this is a subject much agitated and seems the only one they will have to amuse themselves with till they shall receive your congress propositions supposing from this informal talk that such a convention would be ordered jefferson drafted this proposed constitution some time between may  th and june   th on the latter date he wrote madison a convention for the amendment of our constitution having been much the subject of conversation for some time i have turned my thoughts to the amendments necessary the result i inclose you no convention was however called jefferson in      while in paris printed

as an appendix prefaced by the following statement in the summer of the year      it was expected that the assembly of virginia would call a convention for the establishment of a constitution the

avoid this latter necessity it had been proposed even as early as december      see ante ii     to constitute a committee of that body to act in its stead for certain purposes during the war however the sessions were so lengthy that the need was not a pressing one but with the termination of that the difficulties of obtaining a congress and the needlessness of long sessions once more brought the question to the front soon after the congress met in dec      a committee consisting of jefferson osgood and sherman were appointed to report on the subject for this committee jefferson drafted the

not in truth reconciled either to us or to its loss of us but still flatters itself with hopes that some change in the affairs of europe or some disunion among ourselves may afford them an opportunity of recovering their dominion punishing those who have most offended and securing our future dependence it is easy to see by the general turn of the ministerial newspapers light things indeed as straws  feathers and like them they show which way the wind blows and by the malignant improvement their ministers make in all the foreign courts of every little accident or dissension among us the riot of a few soldiers at philadelphia the resolves of some town meetings the reluctance to pay taxes c c all which are exaggerated to represent our governments as so many anarchies of which the people themselves are weary the congress as having lost its influence being no longer respected i say it is easy from this conduct to see that they bear us no good will  that they wish the reality of what they are pleased to imagine they have too numerous a royal progeny to provide for some of whom are educated in the military line in these circumstances we cannot be too careful to preserve the

this document ranks in historical importance of all those drawn by jefferson and but for its being superseded by the ordinance of      would rank among all american state papers immediately after the national constitution its importance has already been commented upon in the introduction that it contains practically every provision which has made the later ordinance famous has been carefully overlooked by those who have desired to give the credit of them to northerners still more have these special pleaders suppressed the fact that jefferson proposed to interdict slavery in all the western territory and not merely in the northwest territory as the ordinance of      did had it been adopted as jefferson reported it slavery would have died a natural death and secession would have been impossible there is another reason however for the little reputation this paper has brought to jefferson aside from the studious suppression of its importance by the special pleaders of new england this plan with its limitation of slavery though failing by only one vote of adoption in      was unpopular at the south and increasingly so as slavery became more and more profitable and more and more a southern institution as early as    0 jeffersons partizans were already his apologists for this document and from that time jefferson carefully avoided any public utterance on slavery this change of attitude is alone sufficient explanation why southerners acquiesced with the northerners in the suppression of this paper and of jeffersons drafting of it in jeffersons memoranda of the services which he took pride in having rendered his country written in   00 he carefully omitted all mention as also in his autobiography written in      and thus it has been left to the massachusetts
