  ye trueborn englishmen proceed our trifling crimes detect let the poor starve religion bleed the dutch be damned the french succeed and all by your neglect   your actions all the world disgust the french are only glad your friends your honesty distrust and while you think youre wise and just the nation thinks you mad   are these the ways your wisdom take to raise our reputation to quarrel at a few mistakes whilst france their own advantage makes and laughs at all the nation   you are the people who of old the nations troops disbanded and now you should your friends uphold your friends and you are bought and sold as always was intended   there is none but fools in time to come will trust the english nation for if they do they know their doom that we will be falling out at home and baulk their expectation   you are the nations grand defense against illegal power and yet against both law and sense and sometimes too without pretense you send folk to the tower   some lords your anger have incurred for treaty of partition but if you will take the nations word most people think it was absurd and empty of discretion    if that treaty as it is famed gave part of spain to gaul why should those gentlemen be blamed when you your selves are not  to let them take it all   bribes and ill practices you found and some few felt your power but soon you run your selves aground for had you pushed the matter round you all had gone to the tower  0 some reformation has from you in vain been long expected but when you should the business do your private quarrels you pursue and the nation lies neglelcted    long has the kingdom born the weight of your deficient funds that parliamentary public cheat pray where is the difference of that and plundering with dragoons    are you the people that complain of arbitrary power then show the nation if you can where kings have been since kings began such tyrants as you are    when kings with right and law dispense and set up power despotick it has been counted law and sense to take up arms against our prince and call in aids exotic    but you although your powers depend on every plowmans vote beyond the law that power extend to ruin those you should defend and sell the power you bought    the king religion did commend to you his lawexplainors we know not what you may intend nor how you should religion mend unless you will your manners    you are the nations darling sons the abstract of our mobb for city knights and wealthy clowns stock jobbers statesmen and buffoons you may defye the globe    toland insults the holy ghost bribed s  r bribes accuses good manners and religions lost the king who was your lord of host the raskal h  w abuses    your statesman g  lle with intent to cultivate with care the dignity of parliament plyes closely at the dancing tent and manages mayfair    the trueborn heroes diligence for public good appears there he refines his wit and sense that the next day in our defense may fill committee chairs  0 the limitation of the crown is your immediate care if your wise articles go down your power will be so lawless grown it is no matter who is the heir    did we for this depose our prince and liberty assume that you should with our laws dispense commit mankind without offense and govern in his room    you should find out some other word to give the crowns accepter to call him king would be absurd for though he will seem to wear the sword it is you have got the scepter    and now your wrath is smoking hot against the kent petition no man alive can tell for what but telling truths which pleased you not and taxing your discretion    if you those gentlemen detain by your unbounded power it is hoped you will never more complain of bishops in king jamess reign sent blindly to the tower    a strange memorial too there came your members to affront which told you truths you dare not name and so the paper escaped the flame or else it had been burnt    some said the language was severe and into passion flew some too began to curse and swear and called the author mutineere but all men said twas true    but oh the consternation now in which you all appear it is plain from whence your terrors flew for had your guilt been less you knew so would have been your fear    in fifteen articles youre told you have our rights betrayed banterd the nation bought and sold the liberties you should uphold no wonder youre afraid    and now to make your selves appear the more impertinent a wise address you do prepare to have his majesty take care rebellion to prevent  0 no doubt his majesty will please to take your cause in hand besides the work is done with ease full seven thousand men he has the nation to defend    one hundred thousand heroes more do our trained bands compose if foraign forces should come orre plant them and you upon the shore how bravely you will oppose    then blush ye senators to see how all men stand dismayed the nation should so patient be to bear with all your villainy and see themselves betrayed    it was our freedom to defend that we the people chose you and we the people do pretend our power of choosing may extend to punish and depose you    for since in vain our hopes and fears petitions too are vain no remedy but this appears to pull the house about your ears and send you home again    these are the nations discontents the causes are too true the ploughman now his choice repents for tho he values parliaments he is out of love with you    when to be chose with caps in hand you courted every voice you were our servants at command by which it seems you understand until we made our choice    if that be true we let you know upon that very score you would best your present hours bestow in all the mischiefs you can do for we will never choose you more finis
