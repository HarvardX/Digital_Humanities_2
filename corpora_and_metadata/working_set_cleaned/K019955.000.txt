a generous undiminishd state too much in vain thomson hail generous corsica unconquered isle the fort of freedom that amidst the waves stands like a rock of adamant and dares the wildest fury of the beating storm and are there yet in this late sickly age unkindly to the towering growths of virtue such bold exalted spirits men whose deeds to the bright annals of old greece opposed would throw in shades her yet unrivaled name and dim the luster of her fairest page and glows the flame of liberty so strong in this lone speck of earth this spot obscure shaggy with woods and crusted over with rock by slaves surrounded and by slaves oppressed what then should britons feel should they not catch the warm contagion of heroic ardour and kindle at a fire so like their own such were the working thoughts which swelled the breast of generous boswel when with nobler aim and views beyond the narrow beaten track by trivial fancy trod he turned his course from polished gallias soft delicious vales from the gray relics of imperial rome from her long galleries of laureled stone her chiseld heroes and her marble gods whose dumb majestic pomp yet awes the world to animated forms of patriot zeal warm in the living majesty of virtue elate with fearless spirit firm resolved by forune unsubdued unawed by power how raptured fancy burns while warm in thought i trace the pictured landscape while i kiss with pilgrim lips devout the sacred soil stained with the blood of heroes cyrnus hail hail to thy rocky deep indented shores and pointed cliffs which hear the chafing deep incessant foaming round their shaggy sides hail to thy winding bays thy sheltering ports and ample harbors which inviting stretch their hospitable arms to every sail thy numerous streams that bursting from the cliffs down the steep channeld rock impetuous pour with grateful murmur on the fearful edge of the rude precipice thy hamlets brown and strawroofd cots which from the level vale scarce seen amongst the craggy hanging cliffs seem like an eagles nest aerial built thy swelling mountains brown with solemn shade of various trees that wave their giant arms over the rough sons of freedom lofty pines and hardy fir and ilex ever green and spreading chestnut with each humbler plant and shrub of fragrant leaf that clothes their sides with living verdure whence the clustring be extracts her golden dews the shining box and sweetleavd myrtle aromatic thyme the prickly juniper and the green leaf which feeds the spinning worm while glowing bright beneath the various foliage wildly spreads the arbutus and rears his scarlet fruit luxuriant mantling over the craggy steeps and thy own native laurel crowns the scene hail to thy savage forests awful deep thy tangled thickets and thy crowded woods the haunt of herds untamed which sullen bound from rock to rock with fierce unsocial air and wilder gaze as conscious of the power that loves to reign amid the lonely scenes of unbroke nature precipices huge and tumbling torrents trackless deserts plains fenced in with guardian rocks whose quarries teem with shining steel that to the cultured fields and sunny hills which wave with bearded grain defends their homely produce liberty the mountain goddess loves to range at large amidst such scenes and on the iron soil prints her majestic step for these she scorns the green enameled vales the velvet lap of smooth savannahs where the pillowd head of luxury reposes balmy gales and bowers that breathe of bliss for these when first this isle emerging like a beauteous gem from the dark bosom of the tyrrhene main reared its fair front she marked it for her own and with her spirit warmed her genuine sons a broken remnant from the generous stock of ancient greece from spartas sad remains true to their high descent preserved unquenchd the sacred fire through many a barbarous age whom nor the iron rod of cruel carthage nor the dread scepter of imperial rome nor bloody goth nor grisly saracen nor the long galling yoke of proud liguria could crush into subjection still unquelld they rose superior bursting from their chains and claimed mans dearest birthright liberty and long through many a hard unequal strife maintained the glorious conflict long withstood with single arm the whole collected force of haughty genoa and ambitious gaul and shall withstand it trust the faithful muse it is not in the force of mortal arm scarcely in fate to bind the struggling soul that galled by wanton power indignant swells against oppression breathing great revenge careless of life determined to be free and favoring heaven approves for see the man born to exalt his own and give mankind a glimpse of higher natures just as great the soul of counsel and the nerve of war of high unshaken spirit tempered sweet with soft urbanity and polished grace and attic wit and gay unstudied smiles whom heaven in some propitious hour endowed with every purer virtue gave him all that lifts the hero or adorns the man gave him the eye sublime the searching glance keen scanning deep that smites the guilty soul as with a beam from heaven on his brow serene and spacious front set the broad seal of dignity and rule then smiled benign on this fair pattern of a god below high wrought and breathed into his swelling breast the large ambitious wish to save his country oh beauteous title to immortal fame the man devoted to the public stands in the bright records of superior worth a step below the skies if he succeed the first fair lot which earth affords is his and if he falls he falls above a throne when such their leader can the brave despair freedom the cause and paoli the chief success to your fair hopes a british muse though weak and powerless lifts her fervent voice and breathes a prayer for your success oh could she scatter blessings as the morn sheds dews to drop upon your heads but patient hope must wait the appointed hour secure of this that never with the indolent and weak will freedom deign to dwell she must be seized by that bold arm that wrestles for the blessing it is heavens best gift and must be bought with blood when the storm thickens when the combat burns and pain and death in every horrid shape that can appall the feeble prowl around then virtue triumphs then her towering form dilates with kindling majesty her mien breathes a diviner spirit and enlarged each spreading feature with an ampler port and bolder tone exulting rides the storm and joys amidst the tempest then she reaps her golden harvest fruits of nobler growth and higher relish than meridian suns can ever ripen fair heroic deeds and godlike action it is not meats and drinks and balmy airs and vernal suns and showers that feed and ripen minds it is toil and danger and wrestling with the stubborn gripe of fate and war and sharp distress and paths obscure and dubious the bold swimmer joys not so to feel the proud waves under him and beat with strong repelling arm the billowy surge the generous courser does not so exult to toss his floating mane against the wind and neigh amidst the thunder of the war as virtue to oppose her swelling breast like a firm shield against the darts of fate and when her sons in that rough school have learned to smile at danger then the hand that raised shall hush the storm and lead the shining train of peaceful years in bright procession on then shall the shepherds pipe the muses lyre on cyrnus shores be heard her grateful sons with loud acclaim and hymns of cordial praise shall hail their high deliverers every name to virtue dear be from oblivion snatched and placed among the stars but chiefly thine thine paoli with sweetest sound shall dwell on their applauding lips thy sacred name endeared to long posterity some muse more worthy of the theme shall consecrate to after ages and applauding worlds shall bless the godlike man who saved his country so vainly wished so fondly hoped the muse too fondly hoped the iron fates prevail and cyrnus is no more her generous sons less vanquished than overwhelmed by numbers crushed admired unaided fell so strives the moon in dubious battle with the gathering clouds and strikes a splendor through them till at length storms rolled on storms involve the face of heaven and quench her struggling fires forgive the zeal that too presumptuous whispered better things and read the book of destiny amiss not with the purple coloring of success is virtue best adorned the attempt is praise there yet remains a freedom nobler far than kings or senates can destroy or give beyond the proud oppressors cruel grasp seated secure uninjurd undestroyd worthy of gods the freedom of the mind the invitation to miss b hic gelidi fontes hic mollia prata lycori hic nemus hic ipso tecum consumerer aevo virgil health to my friend and long unbroken years by storms unruffled and unstained by tears winged by new joys may each white minute fly spring on her cheek and sunshine in her eye over that dear breast where love and pity springs may peace eternal spread her downy wings sweet beaming hope her path illumine still and fair ideas all her fancy fill from glittering scenes which strike the dazzled sight with mimic grandeur and illusive light from idle hurry and tumultous noise from hollow friendships and from sickly joys will delia at the muses call retire to the pure pleasures rural scenes inspire will she from crowds and busy cities fly where wreaths of curling smoke involve the sky to taste the grateful shade of spreading trees and drink the spirit of the mountain breeze when winters hand the roughning year deforms and hollow winds foretell approaching storms then pleasure like a bird of passage flies to brighter climes and more indulgent skies cities and courts allure her sprightly train from the bleak mountain and the naked plain and gold and gems with artificial blaze supply the sickly suns declining rays but soon returning on the western gale she seeks the bosom of the grassy vale there wrapped in careless ease attunes the lyre to the wild warblings of the woodland quire the daisied turf her humble throne supplies and early primroses around her rise well follow where the smiling goddess leads through tangled forests or enameled meads over pathless hills her airy form well chase in silent glades her fairy footsteps trace small pains there needs her footsteps to pursue she cannot fly from friendship and from you now the glad earth her frozen zone unbinds and over her bosom breathe the western winds already now the snowdrop dares appear the first pale blossom of the unripend year as floras breath by some transforming power had changed an icicle into a flower its name and hue the scentless plant retains and winter lingers in its icy veins to these succeed the violets dusky blue and each inferior flower of fainter hue till riper months the perfect year disclose and flora cries exulting see my rose the muse invites my delia haste away and let us sweetly waste the careless day here gentle summits lift their airy brow down the green slope here winds the laboring plow here bathed by frequent showers cool vales are seen clothed with fresh verdure and eternal green here smooth canals across the extended plain stretch their long arms to join the distant main the sons of toil with many a weary stroke scoop the hard bosom of the solid rock resistless through the stiff opposing clay with steady patience work their gradual way compel the genius of the unwilling flood through the brown horrors of the aged wood cross the lone waste the silver urn they pour and cheer the barren heath or sullen moor the traveller with pleasing wonder sees the white sail gleaming through the dusky trees and views the altered landscape with surprise and doubts the magic scenes which round him rise now like a flock of swans above his head their woven wings the flying vessels spread now meeting streams in artful mazes glide while each unmingled pours a separate tide now through the hidden veins of earth they flow and visit sulphurous mines and caves below the ductile streams obey the guiding hand and social plenty circles round the land but nobler praise awaits our green retreats the muses here have fixed their sacred seats mark where its simple front yon mansion rears the nursery of men for future years here callow chiefs and embryo statesmen lie and unfledged poets short excursions try while merseys gentle current which too long by fame neglected and unknown to song between his rushy banks no poets theme had crept inglorious like a vulgar stream reflects the ascending seats with conscious pride and dares to emulate a classic tide soft music breathes along each opening shade and sooths the dashing of his rough cascade with mystic lines his sands are figured over and circles traced upon the lettered shore beneath his willows rove the inquiring youth and court the fair majestic form of truth here nature opens all her secret springs and heavenborn science plumes her eagle wings too long had bigot rage with malice swelled crushed her strong pinions and her flight witheld too long to check her ardent progress strove so writhes the serpent round the bird of jove hangs on her flight restrains her towering wing twists its dark folds and points its venomed sting yet still if aught aright the muse divine her rising pride shall mock the vain design on sounding pinions yet aloft shall soar and through the azure deep untraveld paths explore where science smiles the muses join the train and gentlest arts and purest manners reign ye generous youth who love this studious shade how rich a field is to your hopes displayed knowledge to you unlocks the classic page and virtue blossoms for a better age oh golden days oh bright unvalued hours what bliss did ye but know that bliss were yours with richest stores your glowing bosoms fraught perception quick and luxury of thought the high designs that heave the laboring soul panting for fame impatient of control and fond enthusiastic thought that feeds on pictured tales of vast heroic deeds and quick affections kindling into flame at virtues or their countrys honored name and spirits light to every joy in tune and friendship ardent as a summers noon and generous scorn of vices venal tribe and proud disdain of interests sordid bribe and conscious honors quick instinctive fense and smiles unforced and easy confidence and vivid fancy and clear simple truth and all the mental bloom of vernal youth how bright the scene to fancys eye appears through the long perspective of distant years when this this little group their country calls from academic shades and learned halls to fix her laws her spirit to sustain and light up glory through her wide domain their various tastes in different arts displayed like tempered harmony of light and shade with friendly union in one mass shall blend and this adorn the state and that defend these the sequestered shade shall cheaply please with learned labor and inglorious ease while those impelled by some resistless force over seas and rocks shall urge their venurous course rich fruits maturd by glowing suns behold and chinas groves of vegetable gold from every land the various harvest spoil and bear the tribute to their native soil but tell each land while every toil they share firm to sustain and resolute to dare man is the nobler growth our realms supply and souls are ripened in our northern sky some pensive creep along the shelly shore unfold the silky texture of a flower with sharpened eyes inspect an hornets sting and all the wonders of an insects wing some trace with curious search the hidden cause of natures changes and her various laws untwist her beauteous web disrobe her charms and hunt her to her elemental forms or prove what hidden powers in herbs are found to quench disease and staunch the burning wound with cordial drops the fainting head sustain call back the flitting soul and still the throbs of pain the patriot passion this shall strongly feel ardent and glowing with undaunted zeal with lips of fire shall plead his countrys cause and vindicate the majesty of laws this clothed with britains thunder spread alarms through the wide earth and shake the pole with arms that to the sounding lyre his deeds rehearse enshrine his name in some immortal verse to long posterity his praise consign and pay a life of hardships by a line while others consecrate to higher aims whose hallowed bosoms glow with purer flames love in their heart persuasion in their tongue with words of peace shall charm the listening throng draw the dread veil that wraps the eternal throne and launch our souls into the bright unknown here cease my song such arduous themes require a masters pencil and a poets fire unequal far such bright designs to paint too weak her colors and her lines too faint my drooping muse folds up her fluttering wing and hides her head in the green lap of spring the groans of the tankard dulci digne mero horat of strange events i sing and portents dire the wondrous theme a reverend ear require though strange the tale the faithful muse believe and what she says with pious awe receive twas at the solemn silent noontide hour when hunger rages with despotic power when the lean student quits his hebrew roots for the gross nourishment of english fruits and throws unfinished airy systems by for solid pudding and substantial pie when hungry poets the glad summons own and leave spare fast to dine with gods alone our sober meal dispatched with silent haste the decent grace concludes the short repast then urged by thirst we cast impatient eyes where deep capacious vast of ample size the tankard stood replenished to the brink with the cool beverage blueeyd naiads drink but lo a sudden prodigy appears and our chilled hearts recoil with startling fears its yawning mouth disclosed the deep profound and in low murmurs breathed a sullen sound cold drops of dew did on the sides appear no finger touched it and no hand was near at length the indignant vase its silence broke first heaved deep hollow groans and then distinctly spoke how changed the scene for what unpardoned crimes have i survived to these degenerate times i who was wont the festal board to grace and midst the circle lift my honest face white over with froth like etna crowned with snow which mantled over the brown abyss below where ceres mingled with her golden store the richer spoils of either indias shore the dulcet reed the western islands boast and spicy fruit from bandas fragrant coast at solemn feasts the nectard draught i poured and often journeyd round the ample board the portly alderman the stately mayor and all the furry tribe my worth declare and the keen sportsman often his labors done to me retreating with the setting sun deep draughts imbibed and conquered land and sea and overthrew the pride of france by me let meaner clay contain the limpid wave the clay for such an office nature gave let chinas earth enriched with colored stains pencild with gold and streaked with azure veins the grateful flavor of the indian leaf or mochos sunburnt berry glad receive the nobler metal claims more generous use and mine should flow with more exalted juice did i for this my native bed resign from the dark bowels of potosis mine was i for this with violence torn away and dragged to regions of the upper day for this the rage of torturing furnace bore from foreign dross to purge the brightning ore for this have i endured the fiery test and was i stamped for this with britains lofty crest unblest the day and luckless was the hour which doomed me to a presbyterians power fated to serve the puritanick race whose slender meal is shorter than their grace whose moping sons no jovial orgies keep where evening brings no summons but to sleep no carnival is even christmas here and one long lent involves the meagre year bear me ye powers to some more genial scene where on soft cushions lolls the gouty dean or rosy prebend with cherubic face with double chin and paunch of portly grace who lulled in downy slumbers shall agree to own no inspiration but from me or to some spacious mansion gothic old where comus sprightly train their vigils hold there often exhausted and replenished often oh let me still supply the eternal draught till care within the deep abyss be drowned and thought grows giddy at the vast profound more had the goblet spoke but lo appears an ancient sybil furrowed over with years her aspect sour and stern ungracious look with sudden damp the conscious vessel struck chilled at her touch its mouth it slowly closed and in long silence all its griefs reposed yet still low murmurs creep along the ground and the air vibrates with the silver sound on the backwardness of the spring      estatem increpitans seram zephyrosque morantes virgil in vain the sprightly sun renews his course climbs up the ascending signs and leads the day while long embattled clouds repel his force and lazy vapors choke the golden ray in vain the spring proclaims the newborn year no flowers beneath her lingering footsteps spring no rosy garland binds her flowing hair and in her train no feathered warblers sing her opening breast is stained with frequent showers her streaming tresses bathed in chilling dews and sad before her move the pensive hours whose flagging wings no breathing sweets diffuse like some lone pilgrim clad in mournful weed whose wounded bosom drinks her falling tears on whose pale cheek relentless sorrows feed whose dreary way no sprightly carol chears not thus she breathed on arnos purple shore and called the tuscan muses to her bowers not this the robe in ennas vale she wore when ceres daughter filled her lap with flowers clouds behind clouds in long succession rise and heavy snows oppress the springing green the dazzling waste fatigues the aching eyes and fancy droops beneath the unvaried scene indulgent nature loose this frozen zone through opening skies let genial sunbeams play dissolving snows shall their glad impulse own and melt upon the bosom of the may verses written in an alcove jam cytherea choros ducit venus imminente luna horat now the moonbeams trembling luster silvers over the dewy green and in soft and shadowy colors sweetly paints the checkered scene here between the opening branches streams a flood of softened light there the thick and twisted foliage spreads the browner gloom of night this is sure the haunt of fairies in yon cool alcove they play care can never cross the threshold care was only made for day far from hence be noisy clamor sick disgust and anxious fear pining grief and wasting anguish never keep their vigils here tell no tales of sheeted specter rising from the quiet tomb fairer forms this cell shall visit brighter visions gild the gloom choral songs and sprightly voices echo from her cell shall call sweeter sweeter than the murmur of the distant water fall every ruder gust of passion lulled with music dies away till within the charmed bosom none but soft affections play soft as when the evening breezes gently stir the poplar grove brighter than the smile of summer sweeter than the breath of love thee the enchanted muse shall follow lissy to the rustic cell and each careless note repeating tune them to her charming shell not the muse who wreathed with laurel solemn stalks with tragic gait and in clear and lofty vision sees the future births of fate not the maid who crowned with cypress sweeps along in sceptered pall and in sad and solemn accents mourns the crested heros fall but that other smiling sister with the blue and laughing eye singing in a lighter measure strains of woodland harmony all unknown to fame or glory easy blithe and debonair crowned with flowers her careless tresses loosely floating on the air then when next the star of evening softly sheds the silent dew let me in this rustic temple lissy meet the muse and you the mouses petition to doctor priestley found in the trap where he had been confined all night parcere subjectis and debellare superbos virgil oh hear a pensive captives prayer for liberty that sighs and never let thine heart be shut against the prisoners cries for here forlorn and sad i sit within the wiry grate and tremble at the approaching morn which brings impending fate if ever thy breast with freedom glowed and spurned a tyrants chain let not thy strong oppressive force a freeborn mouse detain oh do not stain with guiltless blood thy hospitable hearth nor triumph that thy wiles betrayed a prize so little worth the scattered gleanings of a feast my scanty meals supply but if thine unrelenting heart that slender boon deny the cheerful light the vital air are blessings widely given let natures commoners enjoy the common gifts of heaven the well taught philosophic mind to all compassion gives casts round the world an equal eye and feels for all that lives if mind as ancient sages taught a never dying flame still shifts through matters varying forms in every form the same beware lest in the worm you crush a brothers soul you find and tremble lest thy luckless hand dislodge a kindred mind or if this transient gleam of day be all of life we share let pity plead within thy breast that little all to spare so may thy hospitable board with health and peace be crowned and every charm of heartfelt ease beneath thy roof be found so when unseen destruction lurks which men like mice may share may some kind angel clear thy path and break the hidden snare to mrs p with some drawings of birds and insects the kindred arts to please thee shall conspire one dip the pencil and one string the lyre pope amanda bids at her command again i seize the pencil or resume the pen no other call my willing hand requires and friendship better than a muse inspires painting and poetry are near allied the kindred arts two sister muses guide this charms the eye that steals upon the ear there sounds are tuned and colors blended here this with a silent touch enchants our eyes and bids a gayer brighter world arise that less allied to sense with deeper art can pierce the close recesses of the heart by well set syllables and potent sound can rouse can chill the breast can sooth can wound to life adds motion and to beauty soul and breathes a spirit through the finished whole each perfects each in friendly union joined this gives amandas form and that her mind but humbler themes my artless hand requires nor higher than the feathered tribe aspires yet who the various nations can declare that plow with busy wing the peopled air these cleave the crumbling bark for insect food those dip their crooked beak in kindred blood some haunt the rushy moor the lonely woods some bathe their silver plumage in the floods some fly to man his household gods implore and gather round his hospitable door wait the known call and find protection there from all the lesser tyrants of the air the tawny eagle seats his callow brood high on the cliff and feasts his young with blood on snowdens rocks or orkneys wide domain whose beetling cliffs oerhang the western main the royal bird his lonely kingdom forms amidst the gathering clouds and sullen storms through the wide waste of air he darts his sight and holds his sounding pinions poised for flight with cruel eye premeditates the war and marks his destined victim from afar descending in a whirlwind to the ground his pinions like the rush of waters sound the fairest of the fold he bears away and to his nest compels the struggling prey he scorns the game by meaner hunters tore and dips his talons in no vulgar gore with lovelier pomp along the grassy plain the silver pheasant draws his shining train on indias painted shore by ganges stream he spreads his plumage to the sunny gleam but when the wiry net his flight confines he lowers his purple crest and inly pines the beauteous captive hangs his ruffled wing oppressed by bondage and our chilly spring to claim the verse unnumberd tribes appear that swell the music of the vernal year seized with the spirit of the kindly spring they tune the voice and sleek the glossy wing with emulative strife the notes prolong and pour out all their little souls in song when winter bites upon the naked plain nor food nor shelter in the groves remain by instinct led a firm united band as marshalled by some skilful generals hand the congregated nations wing their way in dusky columns over the trackless sea in clouds unnumberd annual hover over the craggy bass or kildas utmost shore thence spread their sails to meet the southern wind and leave the gathering tempest far behind pursue the circling suns indulgent ray course the swift seasons and overtake the day not so the insect race ordained to keep the lazy sabbath of a halfyears sleep entombed beneath the filmy web they lie and wait the influence of a kinder sky when vernal sunbeams pierce their dark retreat the heaving tomb distends with vital heat the fullformd brood impatient of their cell start from their trance and burst their silken shell trembling awhile they stand and scarcely dare to launch at once upon the untried air at length assured they catch the favoring gale and leave their sordid spoils and high in either sail so when rinaldo struck the conscious rind he found a nymph in every trunk confined the forest labors with convulsive throes the bursting trees the lovely births disclose and a gay troop of damsels round him stood where late was rugged bark and lifeless wood lo the bright train their radiant wings unfold with silver fringed and freckld over with gold on the gay bosom of some fragrant flower they idly fluttering live their little hour their life all pleasure and their task all play all spring their age and sunshine all their day not so the child of sorrow wretched man his course with toil concludes with pain began pleasures the portion of the inferior kind but glory virtue heaven for man designed what atom forms of insect life appear and who can follow natures pencil here their wings with azure green and purple glossd studded with colored eyes with gems embossed inlaid with pearl and marked with various stains of lively crimson through their dusky veins some shoot like living stars athwart the night and scatter from their wings a vivid light to guide the indian to his tawny loves as through the woods with cautious step he moves see the proud giant of the beetle race what shining arms his polished limbs enchase like some stern warrior formidably bright his steely sides reflect a gleaming light on his large forehead spreading horns he wears and high in air the branching antlers bears over many an inch extends his wide domain and his rich treasury swells with hoarded grain thy friend thus strives to cheat the lonely hour with song or paint an insect or a flower yet if amanda praise the flowing line and bend delighted over the gay design i envy not nor emulate the fame or of the painters or the poets name could i to both with equal claim pretend yet far far dearer were the name of friend characters  semper amabilem horat oh born to sooth distress

cupid wanton boy was young his wings unfledged and rude his tongue he loiterd in arcadian bowers and hid his bow in wreaths of flowers or pierced some fond unguarded heart with now and then a random dart but heroes scorned the idle boy and love was but a shepherds toy when venus vexed to see her child amidst the forests thus run wild would point him out some nobler game gods and godlike men to tame she seized the boys reluctant hand and led him to the virgin band where the sister muses round swell the deep majestic sound and in solemn strains unite breathing chaste severe delight songs of chiefs and heroes old in unsubmitting virtue bold of even valors temperate heat and toils to stubborn patience sweet of nodding plumes and burnished arms and glorys bright terrific charms the potent

as me and if thy breast have felt so wide a wound come hither and thy flame approve i will teach thee what it is to love and by what marks true passion may be found it is to be all bathed in tears to live upon a smile for years to lie whole ages at a beautys feet to kneel to languish and implore and still though she disdain adore it is to do all this and think thy sufferings sweet it is to gaze upon her eyes with eager joy and fond surprise yet tempered with such chaste and awful fear as wretches feel who wait their doom nor must one ruder thought presume though but in whispers breathed to meet her ear it is to hope though hope were lost though heaven and earth thy passion crossed though she were bright as sainted queens above and thou the least and meanest swain that folds his flock upon the plain yet if thou dare not hope thou do not love it is to quench thy joy in tears to nurse strange doubts and groundless fears if pangs of jealousy thou have not proved though she were fonder and more true than any nymph old poets drew oh never dream again that thou have loved if when the darling maid is gone thou do not seek to be alone wrapped in a pleasing trance of tender woe and muse and fold thy languid arms feeding thy fancy on her charms thou do not love for love is nourished so if any hopes thy bosom share but those which love has planted there or any cares but his thy breast enthrall thou never yet his power have known love sits on a despotic throne and reigns a tyrant if he reigns at all now if thou art so lost a thing here all thy tender sorrows bring and prove whose

my arms her bosom touch with soft desires and let her feel what she inspires but cupid if thine aid be vain the dear reluctant maid to gain if still with cold averted eyes she dash my hopes and scorn my sighs o grant it is all i ask of thee that i no more may change than she but still with duteous zeal love on when every gleam of hope is gone leave me then alone to languish think not time can heal my anguish pity the woes which i endure but never never grant a cure song iii sylvia leave me simple shepherd leave me drag no more a hopeless chain i cannot like nor would deceive thee love the maid that loves again  corin though more gentle nymphs surround me kindly pitying what i feel only you have power to wound me sylvia only you can heal  sylvia corin cease this idle teazing love that is forced is harsh and sour if the lover be displeasing to persist disgusts the more  corin it is in vain in vain to fly me sylvia i will still pursue twenty thousand times deny me i will kneel and weep anew  sylvia cupid never shall make me languish i was born averse to love lovers sighs and tears and anguish mirth and pastime to me prove  corin still i vow with patient duty thus to meet your proudest scorn you for unrelenting beauty i for constant love was born  but the fates had not consented since they both did fickle prove of her scorn the maid repented and the shepherd of his love song iv when gentle celia first i knew a breast so good so kind so true reason and taste approved pleased to indulge so pure a flame i called it by too soft a name and fondly thought i loved till chloris came with sad surprise i felt the lightning of her eyes through all my senses run all glowing with resistless charms she filled my breast with new alarms i saw and was undone o celia dear unhappy maid forbear the weakness to upbraid which ought your scorn to move i know this beauty false and vain i know she triumphs in my pain yet still i feel i love thy gentle smiles no more can please nor can thy softest friendship ease the torments i endure think what that wounded breast must feel which truth and kindness cannot heal nor even thy pity cure often shall i curse my iron chain and wish again thy milder reign with long and vain regret all that i can to thee i give and could i still to reason live i were thy captive yet but passions wild impetuous sea hurries me far from peace and thee twere vain to struggle more thus the poor sailor slumbering lies while swelling tides around him rise and push his bark from shore in vain he spreads his helpless arms his pitying

beauteous araminta pined and mourned a false ungrateful youth while dying echoes caught the sound and spread the soft complaints around of broken vows and altered truth an aged shepherd heard her moan and thus in pitys kindest tone addressed the lost despairing maid cease cease unhappy fair to grieve for sounds though sweet can never relieve a breaking heart by love betrayed why should thou waste such precious showers that fall like dew on withered flowers but dying passion never restored in beautys empire is no mean and woman either slave or queen is quickly scorned when not adored those liquid pearls from either eye which might an eastern empire buy unvalued here and fruitless fall no art the season can renew when love was young and damon true no tears a wandering heart recall cease cease to grieve thy tears are vain should those fair orbs in drops of rain vie with a weeping southern sky for hearts overcome with love and grief all nature yields but one relief die hapless araminta die song vi when first upon your tender cheek i saw the morn of beauty break with mild and chearing beam i bowed before your infant shrine the earliest sighs you had were mine and you my darling theme i saw you in that opening morn for beautys boundless empire born and first confessed your sway and ever your thoughts devoid of art could learn the value of a heart i gave my heart away i watched the dawn of every grace and gazed upon that angel face while yet twas safe to gaze and fondly blessed each rising charm nor thought such innocence could harm the peace of future days but now despotic over the plains the awful noon of beauty reigns and kneeling crowds adore these charms arise too fiercely bright danger and death attend the sight and i must hope no more thus to the rising god of day their early vows the persians pay and bless the spreading fire whose glowing chariot mounting soon pours on their heads the burning noon they sicken and expire delia an elegy  tecum ut longae sociarem gaudia vitae inque tuo caderet nostra senecta sinu tibul yes delia loves my fondest vows are blessed farewell the memory of her past disdain one kind relenting glance has healed my breast and balanced in a moment years of pain over her soft cheek consenting blushes move and with kind stealth her secret soul betray blushes which usher in the morn of love sure as the redning east foretells the day her tender smiles shall pay me with delight for many a bitter pang of jealous fear for many an anxious day and sleepless night for many a stifled sigh and silent tear delia shall come and bless my lone retreat she does not scorn the shepherds lowly life she will not blush to leave the splendid seat and own the title of a poor mans wife the simple knot shall bind her gathered hair the russet garment clasp her lovely breast delia shall mix amongst the rural fair by charms alone distinguished from the rest and meek simplicity neglected maid shall bid my fair in native graces shine she only she shall lend her modest aid chaste sober priestess at sweet beautys shrine how sweet to muse by murmuring springs reclined or loitering careless in the shady grove indulge the gentlest feelings of the mind and pity those who live to aught but love when delias hand unlocks her shining hair and over her shoulder spreads the flowing gold base were the man who one bright tress would spare for all the ore of indias coarser mold by her dear side with what content i would toil patient of any labor in her sight guide the slow plough or turn the stubborn soil till the last lingering beam of doubtful light but softer tasks divide my delias hours to watch the firstlings at their harmless play with welcome shade to screen the languid flowers that sicken in the summers parching ray often will she stoop amidst her evening walk with tender hand each bruised plant to rear to bind the drooping lilys broken stalk and nurse the blossoms of the infant year when beating rains forbid our feet to roam well sheltered sit and turn the storied page there see what passions shake the lofty dome with mad ambition or ungoverned rage what headlong ruin often involves the great what conscious terrors guilty bosoms prove what strange and sudden turns of adverse fate tear the sad virgin from her plighted love delia shall read and drop a gentle tear then cast her eyes around the lowroofd cot and own the fates have dealt more kindly here that blessed with only love our little lot for love has sworn i heard the awful vow the wavering heart shall never be his care that stoops at any baser shrine to bow and what he cannot rule he scorns to share my heart in delia is so fully blessed it has not room to lodge another joy my peace all leans upon that gentle breast and only there misfortune can annoy our silent hours shall steal unmarked away in one long tender calm of rural peace and measure many a fair unblemished day of cheerful leisure and poetic ease the proud unfeeling world their lot shall scorn who midst inglorious shades can poorly dwell yet if some youth for gentler passions born shall chance to wander near our lowly cell his feeling breast with purer flames shall glow and leaving pomp and state and cares behind shall own the world has little to bestow where two fond hearts in equal love are joined ovid to his wife imitated from different parts of his tristia jam mea

black assumes the downy whiteness of the cygnets plumes loose scattered hairs around my temples stray and spread the mournful shade of sickly gray i bend beneath the weight of broken years averse to change and chilled with causeless fears the season now invites me to retire to the dear lares of my household fire to homely scenes of calm domestic peace a poets leisure and an old mans ease to wear the remnant of uncertain life in the fond bosom of a faithful wife in safe repose my last few hours to spend nor fearful nor impatient of their end thus a safe port the waveworn vessels gain nor tempt again the dangers of the main thus the proud steed when youthful glory fades and creeping age his stiffening limbs invades lies stretched at ease on the luxuriant plain and dreams his morning triumphs over again the hardly veteran from the camp retires his joints unstrung and feeds his household fires satiate with fame enjoys wellearnd repose and sees his stormy day serenely close not such my lot severer fates decree my shattered bark must plough an unknown sea forced from my native seats and sacred home friendless alone through scythian wilds to roam with trembling knees over unknown hills i go stiff with blue ice and heaped with drifted snow pale suns there strike their feeble rays in vain which faintly glance against the marble plain red ister there which madly lashed the shore his idle urn sealed up forgets to roar stern winter in eternal triumph reigns shuts up the bounteous year and starves the plains my failing eyes the weary waste explore the savage mountains and the dreary shore and vainly look for scenes of old delight no loved familiar objects meet my sight no long remembered streams or conscious bowers wake the gay memory of youthful hours i fondly hoped content with learned ease to walk amidst cotemporary trees in every scene some favorite spot to trace and meet in all some kind domestic face to stretch my limbs upon my native soil with long vacation from unquiet toil resign my breath where first that breath i drew and sink into the spot from whence i grew but if my feeble age is doomed to try unusual seasons and a foreign sky to some more genial clime let me repair and taste the healing balm of milder air near to the glowing suns directer ray and pitch my tent beneath the eye of day could not the winter in my veins suffice without the added rage of scythian skies the snow of time my vital heat exhaust and hoary age without sarmatian frost ye tuneful maids who once in happier days beneath the myrtle grove inspired my lays how shall i now your wonted aid implore where seek your footsteps on this savage shore whose ruder echoes never were taught to bear the poets numbers or the lovers care yet storm and tempest are of ills the least which this inhospitable land infest society than solitude is worse and man to man is still the greatest curse a savage race my fearful steps surround practiced in blood and disciplined to wound unknown

uncouth their vesture terrible their air the lurking dagger at their side hung low leaps in quick vengeance on the hapless foe no steadfast faith is here no sure repose an armed truce is all this

name which natures works through all their parts proclaim i feel that name my inmost thoughts control and breathe an awful stillness through my soul as by a charm the waves of grief subside impetuous passion stops her headlong tide at thy felt presence all emotions cease and my hushed spirit finds a sudden peace till every worldly thought within me dies and earths gay pageants vanish from my eyes till all my sense is lost in infinite and one vast object fills my aching sight but soon alas this holy calm is broke my soul submits to wear her wonted yoke with shackled pinions strives to soar in vain and mingles with the dross of earth again but he our gracious master kind as just knowing our frame remembers man is dust his spirit ever brooding over our mind sees the first wish to better hopes inclined marks the young dawn of every virtuous aim and fans the smoking flax into a flame his ears are open to the softest cry his grace descends to meet the lifted eye he reads the language of a silent tear and sighs are incense from a heart sincere such are the vows the sacrifice i give accept the vow and bid the suppliant live from each terrestrial bondage set me free hush every wish that centers not in thee bid my fond hopes my vain disquiets cease and point my path to everlasting peace if the soft hand of winning pleasure leads by living waters and through flowery meads when all is smiling tranquil and serene and vernal beauty paints the flattering scene oh teach me to elude each latent snare and whisper to my sliding heart  beware with caution let me hear the syrens voice and doubtful with a trembling heart rejoice if friendless in a vale of tears i stray where briars wound and thorns perplex my way still let my steady soul thy goodness see and with strong confidence lay hold on thee with equal eye my various lot receive resigned to die or resolute to live prepared to kiss the scepter or the rod while god is seen in all and all in god i read his awful name emblazond high with golden letters on the illumined sky nor less the mystic characters i see wrought in each flower inscribed on every tree in every leaf that trembles to the breeze i hear the voice of god among the trees with thee in shady solitudes i walk with thee in busy crowded cities talk in every creature own thy forming power in each event thy providence adore thy hopes shall animate my drooping soul thy precepts guide me and thy fear control thus shall i rest unmoved by all alarms secure within the temple of thine arms from anxious cares from gloomy terrors free and feel myself omnipotent in thee then when the last the closing hour draws nigh and earth recedes before my swimming eye when trembling on the doubtful edge of fate i stand and stretch my view to either state teach me to quit this transitory scene with decent triumph and a look serene teach me to fix my ardent hopes on high and having lived to thee in thee to die a summer evenings meditation one sun by day by night ten thousand shine young it is past the sultry tyrant of the south has spent his shortlived rage more grateful hours move silent on the skies no more repel the dazzled sight but with mild maiden beams of tempered light invite the cherished eye to wander over their sphere where hung aloft dians bright crescent like a silver bow new strung in heaven lifts high its beamy horns impatient sor the night and seems to push her brother down the sky fair venus shines even in the eye of day with sweetest beam propitious shines and shakes a trembling flood of softened radiance from her dewy locks the shadows spread apace while meekend eve her cheek yet warm with blushes slow retires through the hesperian gardens of the west and shuts the gates of day it is now the hour when contemplation from her sunless haunts the cool damp grotto or the lonely depth of unpiercd woods where wrapped in solid shade she mused away the gaudy hours of noon and fed on thoughts unripend by the sun moves forward and with radiant finger points to yon blue concave swelled by breath divine where one by one the living eyes of heaven awake quick kindling over the face of either one boundless blaze ten thousand trembling fires and dancing lustres where the unsteady eye restless and dazzled wanders unconfined over all this field of glories spacious field and worthy of the master he whose hand with hieroglyphics older than the nile inscribed the mystic tablet hung on high to public gaze and said adore o man the finger of thy god from what pure wells of milky light what soft overflowing urn are all these lamps so filled these friendly lamps for ever streaming over the azure deep to point our path and light us to our home how soft they slide along their lucid spheres and silent as the foot of time fulfill their destined courses natures self is hushed and but a scattered leaf which rustles through the thickwove foliage not a sound is heard to break the midnight air though the raised ear intensely listening drinks in every breath how deep the silence yet how loud the praise but are they silent all or is there not a tongue in every star that talks with man and wooes him to be wise nor wooes in vain this dead of midnight is the noon of thought and wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars at this still hour the selfcollected soul turns inward and beholds a stranger there of high descent and more than mortal rank an embryo god a spark of fire divine which must burn on for ages when the sun fair transitory creature of a day has closed his golden eye and wrapped in shades forgets his wonted journey through the east ye citadels of light and seats of gods perhaps my future home from whence the soul revolving periods past may often look back with recollected tenderness on all the various busy scenes she left below its deep laid projects and its strange events as on some fond and doting tale that soothed her infant hours o be it lawful now to tread the hallowed circle of your courts and with mute wonder and delighted awe approach your burning confines seized in thought on fancys wild and roving wing i sail from the green borders of the peopled earth and the pale moon her duteous fair attendant from solitary mars from the vast orb of jupiter whose huge gigantic bulk dances in either like the lightest leaf to the dim verge the suburbs of the system where chearless saturn midst her watery moons girt with a lucid zone majestic sits in gloomy grandeur like an exiled queen amongst her weeping handmaids fearless thence i launch into the trackless deeps of space where burning round ten thousand suns appear of elder beam which ask no leave to shine of our terrestrial star nor borrow light from the proud regent of our scanty day sons of the morning first born of creation and only less than him who marks their track and guides their fiery wheels here must i stop or is there aught beyond what hand unseen impels me onward through the glowing orbs of habitable nature far remote to the dread confines of eternal night to solitudes of vast unpeopled space the deserts of creation wide and wild where embryo systems and unkindled suns sleep in the womb of chaos fancy droops and thought astonished stops her bold career but oh thou mighty mind whose powerful word said thus let all things be and thus they were where shall i seek thy presence how unblamd invoke thy dread perfection have the broad eyelids of the morn beheld thee or does the beamy shoulder of orion support thy throne o look with pity down on erring guilty man not in thy names of terror clad not with those thunders armed that conscious sinai felt when fear appalled the scattered tribes thou have a gentler voice that whispers comfort to the swelling heart abashed yet longing to behold her maker but now my soul unused to stretch her powers in flight so daring drops her weary wing and seeks again the known accustomed spot dressed up with sun and shade and lawns and streams a mansion fair and spacious for its guest and full replete with wonders let me here content and grateful wait the appointed time and ripen for the skies the hour will come when all these splendours bursting on my sight shall stand unveiled and to my ravished sense unlock the glories of the world unknown the end
