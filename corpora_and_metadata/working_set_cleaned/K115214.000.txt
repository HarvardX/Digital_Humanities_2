critical reflections upon the emmenology of dr friend  by dr le tellier a french physician  translated from the french  london rinted and sold by j watson over against hungerfordmarket in the strand and by the booksellers of london and westminster       price one shilling and sixpence  preface the best preface in my mind that can be made to this book is a quotation out of itself p    where the author as in a sort of corollary drawn from his own reflections says  from the reflections that have been hitherto made it may be gathered that it is by no means an indifferent matter in practice to adopt indifferently the system of the rupture of the vessels or that of the intrusion of the blood into the lymphatick canals it is of the highest consequence to choose either the one or the other to list on one side or the other and to appear more than ordinarily engaged or concerned therein if the dispute here was only about some insipid barren point of speculation amusing perhaps to the curious but altogether useless and without influence on practice those who regard things only as they are useful might perhaps slumber over it but as our business is here about a capital point which affects and concerns practice to the highest degree since in the two hypotheses the manner of cure is quite different this ought to awake the attention of all practitioners inspire them with an extraordinary relish for the present subject and rouse them totally out of their indifference  and this should indeed rouse out of their indifference not only all gentlemen of the faculty but even methinks should tempt all gentlemen who are as all gentlemen should be men of learning to study this point on purpose to concern themselves in this controversy as it regards the wellbeing of the fair sex the lovely fountain whence under heaven we all have our being women to promote whose health and happiness the man that is not ambitious is a monster the object of all mankinds just detestation  critical reflections women are subject to such regular evacuations that it is very hard to account for and assign the cause thereof some have been of opinion that nature by this flux proposed to purge the blood of the sex from the impurities it contracts thereby to render them more fruitful others by observing the qualities of the blood which women in health ose in their courses have been persuaded that it is so far from being an excrement or mass of filth that on the contrary it is a most pure blood and of consequence very fit and proper to nourish the foetus so much for the final cause or end for which these flowings seem ordained  as for the efficient cause the moving or mechanic principle which in the female body produces these effects men do not agree much better about this than about the final cause and are not much less divided in their opinions as to the manner in which this evacuation is made than they are concerning the end the motives and design which nature may have in procuring it  some authors much devoted to astroculture and accustomed to trample under foot such immediate causes as they have just at hand objects that are too plain familiar palpable and natural for them to look upon but with contempt as things common ordinary trivial these men erect the moon for the efficient cause and make her absolute mistress of the courses in question others somewhat more indulgent and better disposed toward sublunary causes have taken care to make cavities in the womb where they lodge in ambuscade a certain ferment or leaven which they have ordered to sally regularly thence every month to attack the blood in its passage put the humors all in combustion disturb the harmony of the motions the exactness of the functions and in fine to play the little devil that full of malice bent upon mutiny and breathing naught but wild sedition is never at rest nor lays down his arms till he has raised in the blood a tumultuous agitation a disorderly effervescence a more than ordinary fermentation and laid under fire and gore all the region of the matrix which he makes a field of battle that is for some days to be quite overflown with blood and as the object of his rage to appear altogether dismal and in disorder they who judge in the most simple and most natural way and of course the nearest to truth are those who after the famous galen acknowledge for cause and mover of this flowing the plethora or abundance of blood among whom we must confess that dr friend an english physician has most distinguished himself in a treatise he has published upon this subject which though it be not exempt from mistakes as we shall observe in the sequel of this is however in the main a valuable piece both for the singular clearness that shines every where throughout the performance which makes its principal merit and for the great number of very excellent reasonings and essential observations that we see there displayed in the fairest light if one will but vouchsafe to stoop a little to seek for causes in the sublunary empire and not to be oversmitten with the charms of the moon and dazzled with her mighty power in fine if well be impartial judges we shall easily side with galen and without hesitation give to the system of the plethora which has since been so illustrated by dr friend the justice due to it and the preference it deserves  women in their courses do but discharge their superfluity and to be convinced of this it is enough to observe that after they have had these flowings long enough for instance the space of five years they are no ways disordered thereby but on the contrary they continue always alike hold the very same state enjoy the same vigor and if you weigh em you will find em no lighter and yet in this time they have lost a hundred pound of purest blood as loss that should not only weaken them but consume almost their whole substance and reduce them to nothing were it any thing else but superfluity now if women have this redundancy of blood this is what we call the plethora and the matter we are seeking there is therefore this plethora or redundancy of blood in women that is proved but how and by what means is this plethora contracted in the persons of the sex this is what we now must unfold in two or three words women transpire less than men which is proved by four reflections  st their bodies are more weak and tender the parts thereof less robust the texture of the fibers more fine and soft and less proper for oscillatory motions and in fine less vigorous witness their gentle and languishing pulse which shows us plain that the peaceable blood moving easy in ts course and slowly rolling through the drowsy vessels runs not rapidly to the glands neither toward the skin nor elsewhere so that the secretion of the humors cannot very much be promoted add to this that the juices separated in the strainers are not in haste to issue because the secreting pipes have not a systaltick virtue strong enough to squeeze em through and drive em forth with precipitation dly the vessels in women are of a straiter orifice now as the secretion of humors is more or less abundant according s the strainers are bigger or smaller and the blood more or less animated it follows of course that the motion of the blood eing less strong at the same time that the pipes or organs of secretion are more treight in the woman the secretion of the humors must be performed more slowly  dly women are of a moist temperament as plainly appears by the suppleness and softness of their skin now if the fibers are so soaked in humidity it is because they ave not vigor enough to rid themselves of t for that body must be dry which expels with force the juices that come into it and discharges a great part of its moisture y transpiration which is the more abunant in proportion as the oscillation of he vessels is the more vigorous  thly the fair sex is not so active has not so much exercise they lead an idle indolent sedentary life which does not much excite transpiration it is true we see some women robust and engaged in hard labor these because they are as strong as men and have a manly complexion and character are called viragos and such are exempted from the usual courses of women we have also seen womensingers an dancers exempted from these but here may be objected what dr andry advance in his excellent thesis upon exercise tha womens frequent tattle may supply the want of other bodily labor and perhaps hence it comes that women chattering much more than men have less occasion for other exercise we must ow that transpiration is assisted by the motion of the voice in conversation yet these motions are not so considerable as not to leave sufficient matter for womens courses thu is the plethora bred in the sex whenc nature is obliged to prepare a discharge for the superfluous blood whose sally for several reasons is through the womb for this is the part where the blood more plentifully issues because of the great number of blood vessels which being wound and interwoven together spread all over and through the substance in a thousand warps and turnings after a serpentine manner and that which the more conveys the blood this way is the trunk of the escending aorta which is remarkably rger in women than in men to the end that the blood flowing more abundantly ownwards the foetus may thereby be the etter nourished and the easier thrust out y the muscles in time of childbirth now as much propension as the blood has  descend toward the matrix so much as it the greater difficulty to return from ence for thither it tends through the rteries which jirk it pretty fast along d the more readily as the blood of itself y its own weight concurs to the motion ut it returns through the veins which have ot the like force to shove it besides the sisting clog of its own weight which ey have to conquer so that it is always  a disposition to recoil suspended as it  in the vessels which labor to make it se and which to increase the difficul have not so much as a place of rerve to sustain it in its march and dont pply it with suckers to facilitate its inful journey for this also is a point to  observed that the veins of the womb ave no valves so that the blood has a eal of difficulty to gather in this viscus d of consequence has the like difficulty  pass through the conduits that there rminate here it is that i am obliged to ffer in opinion with dr friend about e manner of explaining this passage he pretends that to make way for the blood to escape the arteries must break in their extremities that is toward these parts where they take the name of capillaries he undertakes to prove this rupture by principles deduced from the mathematics whence he draws conclusions for his purpose and in the manner he goes about it h seems to reason very securely and to advance nothing but what seems infallible an undoubted and his argument has all the air of a demonstration victorious and unexceptionable a geometrician who was t prove that all the angles of a triangle ar equal to two right ones and that the tangent touches the circle but in on point would not go more boldly about i nor with more confidence at the sam time the doctors demonstration is fa from geometrical and the geometrica certainty will perhaps be rather found  my side he advances two proposition established by mathematicians  st th the force of a body increases as it acquir either more bulk or more swiftness  both together  dly if the force of the body is superior to that of the obstac which it encounters this obstacle will  surmounted whence he concludes th the force of the blood augments in the plethora because there is together  once both more bulk and more velocity more bulk because the plethora consists abundance of blood more velocity because says he as there is abundance of blood provided it be not slow and viscous t emits the greater quantity of spirits which flow to the heart and the arteries he more briskly to animate them and edouble their contractions now the vessels are to be considered as obstacles that inder the blood from extravasing and uch they continue to be whilst they are uperior or equal in force to the blood hey contain within them but when they ome to be overpowered and the strength f the blood is increased to that degree s to conquer their resistance they straight ield are readily broken and open a free assage through the breaches of their unicks now the vessels the easiest and ttest to yield are those of the womb which being the most attacked are least ble to make resistance and to compreend perfectly well how they give way one eeds only to take notice that the plehora at the same time it augments the orce of the blood weakens the resistance f the vessels for says dr friend in conequence of the big volume of blood that eighs upon the veins and arteries not nly on their sides but perpendicular because of the winding disposition of the essels which by their turnings and counterturnings in their folds and reolds expose their angles and corners to the direct and perpendicular impulse of the fluid by means i say of this big volume of blood the vessels are stretched and dilated and thereby the fibers that compose these vessels leave an opening betwixt em so that their texture being less close and firm and more pressed upon they are more disposed to separate and yield to the attack of the blood if it just so happens that when they are at their weakest the blood has more force than ordinary as it truly has since the plethora gives it more strength as we have proved both by reason of the bloods greater bulk and greater velocity the blood therefore will take the advantage of the vessels disadvantageous situation which being violently stretched widend and pressed lose a great deal of their resistance and can offer but a weak bar against the impetuous force and impulse of the blood wherefore the barrier being surmounted because the fibers of the vessels being widend and but weakly helping each other nor able to make any great struggle against their disunion there is but little to hinder the fluid from breaking its prison from tearing their canals and extravasing the more easily as these winding canals that make a thousand circumvolutions are more exposed to the strokes of the blood being besides destitute of the muscles and the fat to uphold maintain and defend em against the rupture they must therefore yield to the impulse of the blood and be broken to give it way to escape  this is the explication of dr friend and one cannot help agreeing with him in this part of it that the plethora contributes much to the monthly courses at the same time we must also own that notwithstanding all these advantages which we have just now attributed to the blood yet it ought to be contained in a just measure and restrained to certain bounds we must confess with etmuller and riverius that an excessive plethora is more likely to suppress than to excite the courses nay we may further assert that this is the most usual and almost the general cause of these suppressions that afflict the sex the two famous physicians we have just now quoted account for these suppressions by the excessive redundance of blood which they make the cause thereof much in the same manner as we impute the stoppage of urine to the too great quantity of liquor gathered in the bladder which anology is judicious enough it is true it is not exact it runs not upon all four because according to the remark of dr friend who refutes it the bladder is much better furnished than the blood vessels are being fortified with a tunick firm and fleshy too strong to be torn and broken by the affluence of urine which coming there to lodge but in a slow indolent manner without any impetuosity is not able to make any great havoc there all that it does in this case is so to stretch the fibers of the bladder that they cannot come to themselves again and have not freedom enough to contract in order to expel the urine that which also contributes a great deal to the stoppage is that the sphincter of the bladder to wit the muscle that stops the passage thereof has in this case all the advantage and remains master of the field of battle because its antagonist namely the muscular tunick which serves to drive out the urine being stretched dilated constrained and hindered has not strength enough to counterbalance the sphincter much less to overpower it in this respect i shall believe the parallel betwixt the two stoppages to be imperfect but it is just at least in this that it compares a blood which issues not from the vessels because oppressing them by its weight it leaves them not play enough to expel it i say as it compares this blood to the urine that remains in the bladder because being there too abundant it so dilates the bladder that it cannot contract to drive it out on both sides we see a superabundant fluid a solid groaning under the oppression of this superabundance and on both sides is observed a canal or reservior choked with its liquor which it is forced to retain because it is deprived of the means to discharge it inasmuch as this iquor by its excessive quantity triumphs ver the spring of the moving fibers which by being more stretched lose all eir power and play therefore our o authors comparison is in this sense ery just and the reasons we shall allege  the sequel will help to set off the adntage of it and render its validity the ore sensible  dr friend pretends that the plethora n never of itself cause such a suppreson and does never cause it unless when ind with a viscosity and slowness of the ood for says he the particles of the ood being incorporated and close linked gether form such a gross body as can by  means be insinuated into the capillaries here of course it forms an obstruction ow these vessels being stopped through which e blood used to pass it remains shut up in e bigger vessels which are too strong to ve it vent through the rupture of their unicks  at the same time according to this auors reasons one might demonstrate that ese vessels big and strong as they are ght to crack at last and be broken for  the big vessels are more robust than the all they are also attacked by a greater antity of blood in the natural state ey are counterbalanced and in an equilibrium with the fluid but in the present case the fluid must get the better because it augments in strength by reason o its bulk being swollen and reinforced from the reflux of the juices that spring out o the capillaries whilst the vessels extremel surcharged lose their power and cannon hinder the interstices of the extended an suffering fibers from being forced by the affluence of the blood that seeks an outle and by its exorbitant mass has power enough to make itself one through the dyke whose resistance is diminished in proportion as the strength of the blood is encrease this is what might be maintained on o authors system and by his own proof among physicians there are some who explain the monthly courses by the ruptu of the vessels others again take a different road but it seems as if people we only dreaming over this point and shew an indifference that does not appear to  well grounded yet as we have here est blishd the sentiment of dr friend which is the most in vogue it may not be ami to say something of another opinion which though less common does not fail neverth less strongly to engage us in its favou the blood of women being for the resons we have declared liable to gather  the vessels it should of course happen that the blood tending particularly to the lower parts and the veins having no valve he arteries may bring more blood than can e returned by the veins wherefore the eins being filled to the top at a certain me cannot receive the blood that is stili ought afresh to them from the arteries his blood being once shut out from the eins is still less liable to return from hence it came whither then will it go that will become of it thither no doubt here it finds least resistance and that is  the side of the lymphaticks which beg only made to admit the lympha and nvey it to the matrix in order to moien and lubricate this viscus are obliged  yield to the torrent to an extraordina extension of their texture and suffer olence in their diameter in order to reive this superfluous blood pushed out from e arteries and rejected by the veins ow as the lymphaticks must terminate  some issue the canals or excretory ucts destined to the discharge of the ympha serve here to give an outlet to e blood and discharge it  this mechanical account is it not more sy more simple more plain and satisfactory d does it not more honor to nature than e system of the rupture of the vessels  is a constant maxim with philosophers at nature does every thing by ways the ost simple and least expensive now i k on which of these two sides it costs e most in the first place does it not impair the vessels much more by making them so often to suffer a solution of their continuity is not this hurt done to the substance in its solid parts too dear a purchase and the frequent tearing of the vascular tunicks which must every month be broken is not this paying too great a price for the exit of this portion of superfluou troublesome blood but by the other way how will it cost so dear only a little enlargement of the bounds of the lymphatic arteries a little straining of their diameter which is far from making such havoc as this rupture does yet at once does al the business but let us carry this point  little further dr friend pretends to demonstrate how the plethora procures the flux he has recourse to the force  the blood which overpowers the for of the vessels and to establish in the blood this superiority he says that the blood increases in its mass and velocity while the resistance of the vessels diminishes because their fibers being stretch and widend are thereby deprived of the strict union and connection in which consists their force the author admits i the blood a considerable velocity and advances at the same time that the vesse are stretched and restrained as if the swiftness of the blood did not proceed from its being so briskly jerkd beaten and push forward by the powerful oscillation of the vessels which being stretched and restrained re not able to push the fluid with so much igour whence it necessarily follows that e fluid must lose of its velocity instead f gaining more as the author pretends dr friend would have avoided this perexity had he taken care to observe the oving force of the blood and had exlaind himself a little more particularly upon it rejecting as he does the hypothes of fermentation it is to be presumed he bscribes to the oscillation of the solids  in truth he seems to hint in several parts f his book now this system makes the gitation or progressive motion of the flud to depend upon the systaltick virtue of he solid whose spring being more or less nimated makes the blood and all the hunours move with more or less precipitation this is a principle which we think cannot e denied by dr friend and yet this priniple makes against himself because thence  follows that in proportion as the vessels ose of their ease and liberty the blood ar from taking the advantage of their weakness to attack and break them as it does in the sense of this author does it elf abate of its impulse and consequently of its force and so shares in the feebleness of the vessels instead of triumphing over t this carries us yet farther  this swiftness of the fluid being a pure effect of the strong vibration of the solid which at once both contains and chases it is not a portion of the force of the blood but of the force of the vessels which without doubt are strong enough to defend themselves against the irruption and insult of a humor that has no other arms than what they vouchsafe to lend it and which would remain dormant lazy languishing if the vessels were not so kind as to put it in motion here now pray what has the blood to boast of poor and beggarly in it self what has it which it has not received and if it has received all it has wherewith can it prevail how can it have the infolence to employ its strength against those that gave it and turn its arms to the disadvantage of those that armed it hence we may plainly see that the blood having no assistance but what it borrows cannot thence take any advantage against the vessels so that there only remains its own mass whence it can draw any succor but here visibly falls our authors demonstration for the force of the stroke or of the percussion being infinitely greater than any pressure as he himself says after borelli vis actus omni pressione infinito major est and the percussion being the effect of the velocity which it is confessed does not proceed from the bloods own force it consequently follows that the blood to break the vessels wants just that which is the most proper and conducive to this effect so that the force of the percussion failing the blood has no more force than from the ressure of its own mass and this it is alowd is not so powerful by far as the perussion whence after all one may judge at borellis proposition is false in one ense and in the present case may be deed for the blood swiftly moved attacks e vessels and yet it is proved that the orce of the attack is less than that of the essure because the pressure comes from e mass and the mass is properly that which belongs to the fluid it is its own oper force and it can do more with e addition of one degree of mass than ith that of twenty extraordinary degrees f swiftness the reason whereof is evient it is for that by its additional deree of mass it weakens the vessel by idening its fibers and rendering them less le to withstand their disunion which it ever can do by its swiftness suppose it augented to what degree you please therere the force of the pressure unaccompayd with that of the percussion is the on choice they have who after dr friend plain the monthly courses by the rupture f the vessels for this being presupposd e blood can never be in too great a mass d the excess of the plethora can never o any thing but good the blood will ave the more force as it is the more undant and less hurried for as soon as it fails of its swiftness that will be a sig that the vessels have not spring enough to push it vigorously and in this case the more bulk it requires the more it restrain them the more it widens their fibers and puts them out of condition to sustain it weight to ply to its volume and resist it power can any thing be more advantageous to him than this situation in this system let us examine how we may explain the monthly suppressions and wha way we must proceed to remedy the same we are going to observe that it is not indifferent in practice to make choice either of the rupture of the vessels or of the intrusion of the blood in to the lymphaticks as one pleases for these two systems by no means agree they offer for the cur quite different views and contrary indications it is then very important heedfully to distinguish them to choose one of them and to take great care which of the two we choose and to which of the two we adhere this is not to be done with indifference as but too often happens but very carefully with the utmost exactness and after having maturely thought upon it when the blood gathers says the cap  0 author the pulse then grows more strong more lively more quick till the plethora i raised to the highest degree for there are certain limits of plenitude beyond which the quantity of blood cannot augment without affecting and altering its quality est enim certus quidam plenitudinis gradus ultra quem illaesa qualitate sanguinis ugeri nequeat quantitas for the plethora cannot be long a gathering without lackening the pace of the blood plethora enim diu nequit increscere quin comitem sibi adsciscat sanguinis lentorem since continues he toward the approach of the flux the vessels are stretched and dilated to the degree that i have mentioned because the quantity and consequently the force of the blood is increased almost a tenth if the courses fail twice successivery the mass of the blood will be a fifth part augmented unless the flux be equaled by some other evacuations therefore the pressures which the circulating fluid makes upon the sides of the vessels must augment in proportion which said pressure the vessels cannot sustain without being strangely put to it laboring already under the the load of the blood that escaped in the first month adeoque eadem rations increscit ea qua latera vasorum a fluido circulante urgentur pressio quam a vasis citra virium noxam sustineri posse nemo credet qui quam graviter ea sub primae periodi incursum laborent meminerit the slowness of the blood may be supposed from its great abundance which swells so much that the vessels to what degree soever they yield and stretch themselves cannot without breaking give it a space sufficiently vast so that the mass of the fluid is restrained and imprisoned in a vessel whose capacity it far surpasses lentor al ipsa copia oriri potest quae it a supra modum intra vasa turgescit ut ea utcumque distenta satis amplum sanguini circuland spatium praebere nequeant nisi penitu dissiliant fibrae ita tit cum uberior sit quam pro vasorum capacitate fluidi moles majorem patiatur retinentiam sanguis redundans who would think that these reasons which seem to tend to explain the flux should end nevertheless in proving the suppression that to show how the menses are stopped one should make use o all the conditions requisite to make then flow these conditions are on one side the great stretching of the fibers in the vessels which hinders them from resisting their division and puts them in the nearest disposition to be disunited and on the other side the exorbitant volume of the blood as compact as massive as close in its texture as the vascular fibers are loosened and which bears hard upon the sides of the vessels that contain it is it not visible that all the advantage is here on the side of the blood the solid is dilated the fluid is close knit behold here is the extension and the pressure that is demanded as for the swiftness or percussion we have poved there is no occasion for it the luid then has here all the force it can ave since it has an enormous reinforceent of mass in which as we have obrvd consists all its power and the solid as weak as it can be since it is owned by e author himself that it cannot withit pain citra virium noxam sustain the  eight of the fluid and that the vessels  wever dilated cannot without bursting e a free space to the blood nisi peni dissiliant fibrae then what can hinder is bursting why dont we immediate see the fibers crack they who lose as ch of their resistance as the blood acires of strength all morbifick suppresn says cap  0 dr friend depends either on e fault of the vessels or on the fault of e blood the fault of the vessels consists  their restraint that of the blood in its wness it is agreed that the vessels are  here in a state of constriction but on e contrary that they are in great distenn so here is no fault of theirs neither the blood to blame if it be slow for its wness only proceeds from its great quany in which all its strength consists so at this slowness far from impeding raer provokes the flux for if the blood s less slow the vessels would be less reaind more left as it were to themselves d enjoying the advantage of their ease and liberty as the blood would have that of its velocity they would by consequence be less disposed to be broken so the excessive plethora and the extreme slowness far from causing suppressions cannot on the system of the rapture o the vessels but rather procure and favor in the sex this particular evacuation dr friend calls it a vice in the vessels to be in a condition to hinder themselves from being broken this is indeed a vice in hi system and in respect of his opinion b absolutely and in the main it is none o the contrary it is a frailty a dishonor a defect in them so to break for the vessels to be of a structure sufficiently foli sufficiently furnished and fortified seat sufficiently to advantage strong enough t resist the disunion of their fibers to with stand their breaking and stoutly to maitain themselves found and whole this is  a defect it is a perfection on the contary dr friend calls slowness a vice in the blood which however is none on his system and according to his hypothesis the in the main and in fact it is one for the slowness of the blood though it be absolutly in itself an ill quality is a good one the present case it being that which give power to the blood and makes it strong it follows from thence that the blood canever be too slow nor too abundant procure the courses then how are the stopped how account we for their suppressin etmuller riverius dr friend himself agree that an excessive plethora may ause this suppression but how is this to e explained in the doctrine of our author  it not evident that the more enormous e quantity of the blood is the distentin of the vessels is made the more considerle and the readier they are to break n the hypothesis of the bloods intrusion to to the lymphaticks nothing is more easy  explain than this suppression the bloodessels being stuffed distended dilated and l groaning under the oppressive weight f their fluid have not play and liberty enough to expel it into the lymphaticks and to chase it through the pipes that discharge e excrement so as the fluid cannot be reoved chased drove on because the prodiious mass restrains the solid stops and weakns its systaltick virtue so that it remains agnant in the sanguine capillaries for want f a force strong enough to push it into he lymphaticks and not being able to ake its way through the excretory chanels it remains engaged in the vessels which ith its bulk it oppresses and makes the ex feel the overwhelming weight that ttends the suppression of their courses  every morbifick suppression says our  author which depends upon the fault f the vessels or of the blood offers two indications the one to open the canals that are obstructed and stopped the other to correct and reduce the blood the fault of the canals continues he is either to grow hard and stiff by a natural dryness or to be contracted by a sudden coldness in such wise that they oppose the impulse o the blood and resist their being broken to remove this impediment according to the opinion of this illustrious physician we must relaxe the fibers but there is an equivocation in this relaxe which it is wort while to clear up we usually understan by laxity or relaxation a state opposite to tension a state where the fibers are supple and not stretched where they a freely and without restraint because being sufficiently moistened they are flexibl and pliant whereas dr friend seems t understand by laxity the state of the fbres widend pulled and stretched into  strong distention so according to thi idea the more the canals are swelled wit the abundance of the liquid the more the fibers will be widened one from another and the more they will be relaxed whenc it follows that to effect the relaxation taken in this sense and on the present hypothesis to make the menses flow the sure means is to draw into the pipes as much as one can wherewith to swell obstruc stuff and clog them it is visible that a this strangely dilating the vessels so wdens their fibers that they scarce touch ne another and this procures the laxity that dr friend demands the laxity that i first mentioned taken in the natural and ordinary meaning of the word is quite ifferent from this and on the system of dr friend as much contrary to the monthy courses as the other is favorable to them the one is procured by the suppleess and flexibility the other by the force he torture the pulling and stretching of he fibers wherefore if it be proper in rder to make the courses flow that the fibers should be pulled stretched widend and forced nothing can be more adverse and opposite to this flowing than this state is where the fibers are supple flexible pliant at their ease their own masters unrestrained no way suffering no way molested this presupposd we are going to see which of these two relaxations dr friend proposes to us as the subject of our consideration and we shall observe upon this occasion that he does not too well here agree with himself for as these two relaxations are incompatible to admit the one is excluding the other though dr friend seems as if he would chime in with both for this end says he namely to conquer the resistance of the vessels and to procure the relaxation of the fibers we must apply exterior remedies moderately warm such as fumigations baths and fomentations prepared with emollient and penetrating herbs ad hunc finem tepide adhibentur externa remedia qualia sunt suffitus balnea fomenta exherbis emollientibus and penetrantibus conflata this is proper to procure that sort of relaxation which consists in the suppleness and flexibility of the fibers but not the other which consists in the stretching widening and constraining them to render them less able to resist the impulse of the fluid contractu autem vasorum inhibito vasorum later a laxius explicantur and fluido impingenti debilius resistunt if one has a mind to break the vessels methinks it is going the wrong way about it to make them supple pliant tractable yielding for the more flexible and yielding they are the less they are disposed to be broken the more supple sure the lefs frangible a dry cord will sooner break than a moist one and if dr friend will be pleased to take a little notice of this he will observe that a dry and hard vessel is more frail and easy to be broke than a pliant softened moistened one what view then can this able physician have and what indication leads him to relaxe the vessels by emollients such as baths fumigations fomentations i here appeal to the judgment of this excellent author himself so well versed as he is in mechanics perhaps i am dazzled with a false light myself yet till i am enlightened i shall always imagine that the blood in its motion will sooner break vessels hard and dry which make head against it are directly exposed to the full strength of its impulse to the force of its collisions more within the reach of its sallies more the mark of its impetuosity and of its fiercest and briskest attacks than vessels softened which by their yielding suppleness dexerously avoid all the thrusts the blood can ake against them as we see the pliant eeds elude the attack of the most outageous tempests whilst oaks that stand ll butt against them and stiffly sustain the assault lie rooted up and prostrate upon the ground the illustrious victims and the magnificent trophies of the furious tempests power the coldtoo that iffens the fibers seems also to render them he more frail and liable to break this eing so who does not see that desiccatives ere are much more proper than emollients ho does not here see that instead of softeng the vessels that are too dry and hard d slackening the fibers that are too stiff e must maintain them in their dryness and iffness and far from diminishing any thing  these we must augment them as much  we can because we shall infallibly renr the vessels and fibers more frail in oportion as we shall render them more y and stiff the more violence we do em the more stress and torture we put them to emollients in this case seem quite contrary to our purpose because they seem more proper to make the conduits play by setting them at their ease than to make them yield to such a rupture as our illustrious author desires hippocrates he observes in a suppression of the courses advises to begin with a purgation by fomentations suppressis mensibus fomenta purgationi esse praemittenda mone hippocrates but if the purgation operate in the same manner as they say the fluxe do by the rupture of the vessels the us of fomentations far from being serviceabl here would be hurtful but as it is confess that the purge dont work in this manne but by quite different ways to say tha the fomentation is useful here is at the same time to say that it is not prop for the fluxes which differ so much from the purgation we foment before purgation to make the excretory ducts more yielding and more disposed to emit their juices th they may the better hearken to the instigtion of a purgative and be the more ecaciously persuaded to do what we wou have them this is our drift in fomenttions and this does not drive at breaking tearing and disjoining the fibers but tr to sooth temper refresh and supple the to give the juices we design to discharge free easy natural passage through the issue the pipes destined for that purpose so the o foment in the suppression of the terms ll the same as in purgation is to go against he indication that prescribes the rupture f the vessels it is to have opposite views and take opposite courses to the system in question dr friend observes that the vessels are more easy to open in summer han winter yet they are more stiff more retchd and of consequence more frail  winter so that their opening seems to epend less upon the rupture that the winer favors most than upon the disoppilaon of the capillaries which the summers eat promotes most by means of which the blood flows more freely its velocity is reforced its impetuosity is augmented and e rapidity it contracts in this charming eason prepares it the better to pass through e lymphaticks and to escape through the xcretories here behold the flux reestashd let us now come to the way of reoving the second cause of suppression knowledged by dr friend which deends upon the fault of the blood and to which he makes an insensible transition ut says he if the vessels continue too ng hard the plethora which augments very day corrupts and at last perverts the blood whence we have before drawn another cause of suppressions which is ore frequent quod si diutius perstiterit asorum durities plethora indies accresns sanguini tandem vitium inducit unde altera eaque multo frequentior suppressorum mensium causa in prioribus deducta est here we see beyond doubt the excessive plethora which we have shown was so proper to break the vessels acknowledged however as the principal cause of the suppression this seems to me very hard to clear up pray dont forget this last cited passage for we shall want you to remember it in the sequel  we would resettle the courses it is a thick abundant viscous blood that stop them we must change its quality now the source of this quality is its excess o quantity it is this we must fall foul of the point is to correct the slowness bu the slowness it is owned produces the excessive plethora our affair is then with this plethora it is this we must first attac upon this principle we immediately conceive bleeding to be of use bellini a we are told by dr friend proves tha bleeding increases the motion of the blood here we should distinguish bleeding raise the fever and cures it quickens the blood and makes it run slower those wh have a right and just notion of the anima mechanism perceive the reason of the seeming contrarieties the vessels being stuffed excessively have not freedom enou to exert their oscillations to kindle the feverish motions and to conquer the gre bulk of stagnant humors by hot strok of systole and redoubled vibration we let blood the resistance is diminished the solids are let loose the fluids are disengaged the blood is set a running this s the case of an apoplexy to which t is wholesome that a fever should succeed the solids after having been so long ppressd are at last at their ease set t large and in full power and make he agglomerated fluids that had conspired against them feel the force of their blows he effect of their resentment and the experience of their revenge the blood after first bleeding though still abundant enough o vex irritate and stretch em yet is no more able to overpower and conquer em mean while the bleeding having set the blood in motion will in a little time abate ts sallies and restrain its frolicks the resistance of the fluids that maintains the solids in their unbridled oscillations in proportion as it diminishes will calm and reduce them to their natural vibrations the fury of the vessels will abate in proportion as the mass of the blood diminishes because by how much the bulk of the blood is lessened by so much less opposition will the vessels feel the less of course will they be excited to furious motions and the more disposed to recover their usual course their ordinary oscillations their natural motions then as the blood contracts its slowness from its excessive abundance the bleeding diminishing this shows us how much it contributes to correct the slowness of the blood this being presupposed one would think the doctor should favor this remedy and one would not imagine how in consequence of his principles he could advance that in the beginning of a disease the blood being too slow it should not be proper to let blood unless there be reason to hope that thereby the viscidity of the blood may be corrected and even though there should be an appearance of this yet ought not bleeding to be chosen if any other method can be thought of to restore the blood to its velocity without lessening its volume but what is strangely surprising is to see such a man as dr friend in whom sound judgment takes place so much of prejudice giving into vulgar notions and fancies without foundation he has regard to the weakness of the persons who suffer in these stoppages which does not proceed from inanition but overrepletion not from a scarcity but from a stock of forces stowed in too narrow compass which only want to be set at large as they are by bleeding a weakness however from which a pretense is drawn to save that blood which wants to be diminished in order to exert its hidden force that is quite stifled by its own redundancy a weakness whence a counterindication is drawn against bleeding to cure it to make its unactive dissembling force exert and declare itself women they usually say are so weak in these suppressions that they cannot bear bleeding which causes such a prompt and brisk revolution in the humors is not this language altogether vulgar it is what the common sort of people usually say through prepossession rather than reflection dr friend also says neque oc sane praetermitti debet quod in iis quius supperssi sunt menses it a fere vires imninutae sint ut sanguinis missionem a qua deo expedita inducitur humorum mutatio ninus sustinere queant at this rate plethoricks should not be let blood for the plethora takes away their strength and we see that the more blood they have the weaker they are but this notion was too unworthy of dr friend for him to fix for any time upon it so it is not long before he goes off from it bleeding happens to fall unto disgrace but a few lines lower it again recovers its credit and in the very same case where it underwent the disgrace sometimes however says our author the blood gives certain symptoms of its state and constitution which carefully considered oblige to open a vein and to open it too with success one of these symptoms may be a pulse full and weak which is sometimes observed in the beginning of a distemper nothing but good can come of bleeding upon this occasion for thence results a greater velocity and of consequence in the opinion of dr friend the greater force of the blood nonnunquam tamen sanguis ea de se praebet indicia quibus siquis diligentus studuerit venam haud inauspicato poterit secare talis indicii exemplum sit pulsus plenus and imbecillis qui morbo nondum inveterato aliquando observatur itaque ad hunc modum constituto pulsus venae sectio si adhibita sit sanguis momentum intendet since a full and weak pulse allows and even obliges to bleed the weakness of people afflicted with these suppressions is not therefore a good reason to forbear bleeding for with a full and weak pulse as our author observes and which in his opinion prescribes phlebotomy women cannot but be weak it is not the weakness then that forbids bleeding the reason dr friend adds to authorize the precaution he advises in order to diminish the blood is not very sure he says that when the arteries are so full that the tunicks are stretched and take up a greater space it is a sign that the humors are not yet thickened for if their mass was considerably thick and sizy in its texture it would take up less room because its particles would be less close and the arteries thereby less stretched this is however what a body cannot trust to because the mass of humors close thickened and condensed may happen to be in such abundance as to stretch the tuicks to a considerable dilatation without bating the velocity of the humors whose redundance is no way incompatible with their extreme condensation so that from he arteries taking up no great space there s no concluding that the fluid they conain is very massive for it may be massive ompact and close in its texture at the ame time that it is ample large and exended in its volume a little attention ere will show there is no repugnance in his a little further the author says that he vascular tunicks unbent by the bleedng less resisting the blood that strikes upon them the force of the stroke is thereby weakened tunicis sanguini affluenti mius renitentibus deficit ictus magnitudo at this rate it is ill done to bleed since it weakens the force of the blow which r friend makes the principal promoter of he fluxes the business therefore is not o slacken the tunicks nor to render them upple and pliant but on the contrary to tretch them all we can and to render them tiff dry and hard for dr friend agrees that in this state they make the most resistance now according to his account in his  th mathematical proposition cap   the motion lost that is communicated is proportioned to the resistance motus deperditus st ut resistentia but the force of the strokes is also measured by the motion lost in percutientibus corporibus ictuum magnitudo motui deperdito proportionalis est then as there is most resistance made by the fibers stretched stiff dry and hard the blood that strikes upon em loses still the more of its motion since the motion lost is answerable to the resistance made therefore the force of the stroke is the greater in these fibers since the force of the strokes are suitable to the quantity of the motion lost therefore in fine these sor of fibers must sooner crack than fibre that are supple slack and flexible the blood is supposed abundant observe her then the force the fibers are supposed t be widened and distended behold weaknes here wherefore all the power and advantage is here on the side of the blood now if the force of a body surmount the force of the obstacle it has to encounter this obstacle must give way according to the second proposition si momentu corporis sit majus quam contraria impedimenti vis id impedimentum removebitur the vessels in this case must be broken and cannot hinder the blood from extravasing upon these principles settled by dr friend himself methinks i may with out the imputation of too much presumption on defy him to explain the suppression o the fluxes by an excessive plethora and by the dryness and hardness of the vessels which make too great a resistance for all his wonderfully contributes to the flux s i think has been heretofore sufficiently emonstrated our author is inclined to be f opinion that bleeding should be used ather after than before the purgatives and mmenagogues which are the remedies ore especially designed to promote the reular courses the reason he gives for it  that the purgatives and emmenagogues eak refine and attenuate the gross comacted humors whence the blood being ore clear is more disposed to be divided parated dislodged and to acquire force after bleeding but this advice seems conary to what he gives before where he dvises not to let blood if there be any ther means to increase its velocity witht lessening its quantity because in bleedg we diminish the plethora which pleora contributes in a particular manner to e force of the flood and which if we ave it entire cannot but augment its ower now since the remedies which r friend would prescribe previous to the leeding would break the compact texture f the blood rectify that and of course ive it velocity why not stop there why eddle with the plethora which is so comended and held so sacred as we may say  the present system that we cannot be without it why not rather spare it when e have procured the velocity of the blood another way by other means than bleeding hence we see that dr friend ha established nothing certain here upon the matter of bleeding in cases of suppression so we dont know what to stick to no what to build upon in his system he doe not explain himself precisely enough h does not sufficiently dive into and unfol the matter he sometimes loses sight  the principles to which all should tend and by that means he is led into perplexities and falls into contradictions but to frequently of all which i shall take  notice for i do not here pretend to tra dr friend through all the windings and deviations that appear in his book  before we pass on to an article so important as to inquire of the place where  is fit to bleed whether it be in the arm  in the foot i desire it may be called t mind that the swiftness of the blood is th principal foundation of our authors system and yet we have proved it to be a ruino foundation since the blood cannot app to the disadvantage and prejudice of the vessels a strength it receives from them and a velocity for which it is obliged t them so that the doctrine of our autho is in that point alone sappd from the very foundation this is what i desire man be well remembered once for all for have no inclination to be troublesome b repeating it so often over lindanus etmuller counsels at the approach of the courses to bleed in the arm whereas in the actual course already begun he sends you to bleed in the foot which he never rders to be done but in a course either actually flowing or suddenly stopped and etmuller accounts for this doctrine in the following manner  upon the approach of the menses the blood being abundant and swelled nature xerts all her efforts to precipitate it to the ower parts but the conduits being small cannot on a sudden yield and open so on on the contrary being stretched and onstraind they refuse a passage to the blood because they are not at freedom o contract themselves and make way for he blood in this circumstance if you leed at the foot you draw the blood ownwards you charge the matrix more ou add clog upon clog and raise the diemper to the highest degree on the contrary bleed in the arm you divert the blood from the parts that are oppressed therewith you facilitate its course you clear he ways through which it is to pass and ou give the conduits the suppleness they ant to issue forth the blood they convey or the bleeding at the foot will never rovoke the terms unless they be actully flowing or by a sudden cold or seizng fright have their course interrupted this way of reasoning dr friend can no wise relish it has something in it that is strange and shocking to him here it is supposed says he that the blood is so swelled and rarefied that it might easily flow thro the vessels if when it is carried downwards the plenitude it contracts did not form an obstacle to its discharge that the vessels the more they are gorged with blood are less in a condition to yield to the torrent he rejects this finds it contrary to medical philosophy and even inconsistent with common sense but is this reproach well grounded and have not we a right to make it recoil upon its author etmuller is here accused not to have common sense this accusation if it be found unjust will it not rebound upon dr friend shall we have more respect for him than he has for one of the greatest masters in physic the english physician is so prepossessd with his own opinion and so glewdd as it were to his own system that he considers n others and takes no pains to enter into the sentiments of the german physician there is a system which is satisfied to make the vessels yield or burst to give way to the menses according to this idea it is natural and reasonable that the more the vessels are swelled and distended by the blood the more fit they are to yield and to be broken but have we not observed tha dr friend himself falls into the same absurdity which he reprimands in etmuller have we not observed a case where the ditention of the vessels being presupposd and the abundance of the blood that dilates them he still owns a suppression we need ut call to mind what has been lately said upon the slowness of the blood bye and ye we shall see another parallel case so that it is important not to let flip without notice what he advances here at the ame time this system which we have just ow seen is not the only one there is another which does not make the vessels yield ut on the contrary makes them act to rovoke the terms now the fluxes on his hypothesis not depending on the vessels that yield but which make the blood ield to them not on their conquered forces ut on their superior action on their victorious power on their sovereign empire on their triumphant oscillation it is not on his system a thing contrary to common sense that the vessels should be so much ess fit to procure the courses the more hey are dilated and swelled to excess because then though much more easy to be overcome they are less qualified to ad act and free themselves which is what is required in this other system our author will have it that if the bleeding in the foot provokes the terms that flow or that are stopped in flowing it would also recall them when suppressed from their flux though of a long standing this consequence is not just but why says he in the first case does this bleeding augment the force of the blood in hurrying it downwards and does not augment it in the second case acting still in the same manner the question is not here about the force of the blood etmuller is not obliged to speak in consequence to the principles of dr friend and dr friend is but ill warranted to measure every thing by his own ideas and suit every thing to his own hypothesis to do this he first must prove that the only way to be taken is that which he has taken and that his is the only system that can rationally be followed he ought first to have made it impregnable and not have left such a hold to be laid on it as he has done since this system according to what appears in our remarks is by so many ways so successfully shaken  the bleeding in the foot excites the terms that flow and that are interrupted in flowing because then the sole business is to assist the bloods determination toward the uterine region the blood flows this is a sign that it is cleared refined wellconditiond and that the vessels are not embarassd now the passages the issues the conduits being free and cleared the new blood which the bleeding in the foot determines that way will easily pass and without pain proceed to its exit the blood that just now flowed ceases and flows no more in this case it is only repelled only its determination happens to be altered by some unlucky accident and you must recall the blood to its determination downwards here you have nothing to conquer ut the repercussion wrought either for example by a stopping cold or by a seizng fright and this the bleeding in the foot does it determines the blood toward he matrix and restores it to its former tendency but a suppression of a long tanding being caused by the congestion and stoppage of the blood in the uterine caillaries our business is not here about its tendency toward the vessels but about its discharge and enlargement from the vessels themselves the matter is not now to ttract the blood downwards but to clear way that which is already there and which is there but in too great a quantity ince it is this very quantity itself that reners it there so very clogging and troubleome dr friend agrees that the bleedng in the arm practiced in such a case withdrawing a portion of the blood toward he superior parts the conduits of the womb are thereby in truth relieved but ays he the diminution of the plethora bating the impetuosity of the blood the vessels are not so disposed to break because he vessels are less extended this is another irregular reason which supposes we cannot take from the abundance of the liquid without abating aught of its velocity which is directly contrary to what the author owns himself a little before in these words igitur triduo ante consultum perioditempus secatur vena ut tum praecipue novus sanguini accrescat impetus cum augmenti summam attigerit plethora what stress can we lay after this upon the decisions of dr friend what can we reckon upon to what principle shall we adhere the sentiment of etmuller is confirmed by a famous observation of riverius upon a woman whose terms always stopped as often as she was blooded in the foot and very largely flowed when she was blooded in the arm this phenomenon agrees but little with the ordinary ideas of physicians the doctors of montpellier have explained it by a mechanism very well contrived but incompatible with the system of our author whom one may defy with all hi efforts and vast capacity to account for this fact related in the second history o the first century of riveriuss observations this woman say the doctors being plethorick and attacked with a suppression caused by the prodigious mass of the blood which dilated the vessels of the matrix to such a degree that they could not sufficiently use their contracting power when by bleeding in the foot the blood was determined toward those parts which were already overchargd therewith the clog was augmented and occasion given to an obstinate suppression but when by bleedng in the arm the blood was invited to the superior parts the vessels of the uterus were disengaged now their plenitude and distention being diminished they could conract and play with more ease and so proure the natural and periodical evacuation which is made through issues of the matrix dr friend intrenches himself in this suberfuge which is in a distinction he makes etwixt a plethora which he calls solitay and that which is joined with a lentor and he says it is only in this that the preaution of lindanus noted in etmuller akes place he adds that the woman f whom riverius speaks was troubled ith this sort of plethora and upon this ottom he approves the indication which he montpellier doctors have taken and ubscribes to their practice the author hen grows a little more mild toward lindanus and declares that what is relaed by etmuller takes place in one case e is therefore in the wrong to cry out so ard against it and pronounce without ground that there is not common sense in he reasoning of that author here he should make reparation to his honor he agrees that in suppressions one bleeds first in the arm and then in the foot he ssigns for a reason of this that the bleedng in the arm augments the velocity of the blood and bleeding in the foot augments the plethora in regard to the uterine vessels but is this what he said at first might not one prove by his own principles that the consent he gives to this practice is not very rational let us call to mind what dr friend has said does not common sense require that the more the vessels are swelled the more they are supposed to yield crack and break ne communis quidem sensus ferret vasa quo magis sanguine distenta sint eo minus esse ad cedendum facilia now in the plethorick woman we are talking of when she is blooded in the foot this augments the swelling of the uterine conduits which are thereby more disposed to break and give way yet the doctors of montpellier caused the woman to be blooded in the arm and by this bleeding one will say with dr friend it is true that the uterine passages are cleared of their stoppage and oppression but as the impetuosity of the blood languishes by the diminution of the plethora the vessels are rendered less liable to break because they are then less extended secta brachii vena cum nonnihil sursu revellitur liberantur quidem ab oppression viae uterinae sed impetu ob plethoram imminutam languente haud ita facile dissili unt vasa quia minus sunt distenta the slowness and the viscidity of the blood is according to our author a reason not t bleed and bleeding does no good in supressions save when the particles of the blood are enough disengaged and not very enacious because then they easily shift their place and are persuaded to what he alls dimotion now he agrees that the blood of the woman we talk of was visous slow and tenacious how then on his rinciples can he allow her to be blooded ne has only to compare what he has adanced with the explications he now gives n occasion of this woman to see that all ont agree and that the system which is ffered to us as incontestable and as a rst principle avowed by every body is not ell supported i should have a great many ore remarks to make upon it but i cone myself to this precise reflection which ay furnish many more if the flowing of e menses could be wrought by the rupre of the vessels it would be more partilarly done when the vessels were the most angible now the vessels are most frail hen they are the most extended but they re the most extended when they are the ost gorged with blood and they are more orgd with blood by bleeding in the foot an by bleeding in the arm therefore eeding in the foot stuffs them more with blood stretches them more and makes em more frangible then as bleeding  the foot renders the uterine vessels ore frail and more ready to be broken it should in the woman we are speaking of provoke the monthly flux if this flux is wrought by the breaking of the vascular tunicks the blood is excessively abundant it has all that it can want to prevail the vessels on their part are dilated and stretched to the last degree so here is all that is wanting to conquer them the what hinder them from being broken and since the bleeding of the foot in stretching them disposes them more than ever to burst is i not evident that it favors and ought eve necessarily to produce the flux if thi must be explained by the rupture of the vessels i omit several irregularities to finis this discussion with two words of observation upon some histories of fact relate by our author concerning suppression the first history is of a girl eighteen years old yet without her terms who complained  a great pain in her loins knees and ancles she had difficulty in breathing squeamishness and gripes her heart upon the least exercise panted her complexion wa lively and florid her pulse weak an slow she was very much afflicted with the symptoms for about six months dr frein did not find here any indication for bleeding he only proposed to break and refin by attenuants the viscous texture of the blood  but is it not a wise precaution when the vessels are too much stretched and the blood too thick sizy and stiff to unbend the vessels and to diminish the volume of the blood in order to facilitate the action of ncisive remedies that they may lay more hold upon the massive humors is it not isquing a great deal to undertake to rarify  blood which we dont diminish in the vessels whose sides we cannot further tretch and all whose space the blood by ts thickness now takes up where then will be space for it in its rarefaction but his is the means one will say to make he uterine capillaries crack but this is lso the means to burst other vessels too this practice makes us justly fear the rupture of other important vessels and of consequence terrible hemorrhages besides it s enough if we consult the motions of physic to persuade us that a mass of juices thick gross glewy and compact resists too much the action of attenuants and the virtue of incisives for them to be able to ay hold of penetrate and thrust themselves thereinto they can do no more in this case but shove struggle and rummage in this mass instead of insinuating nicely into the pores wriggling subtly and without noise into the interior of the substance so to separate with as much efficacy as little disturbance the particles thereof bleeding which is preparative to the use of opium and which the most secures us in it as has been clearly proved in the judicious reflections that have been made thereupon should for the same reasons be a preparative for emmenagogues and secure their success  bleeding then might have been applied in curing the sick person in question every thing seemed to indicate this and above all the difficulty of breathing the palpitation of the heart and the ruddy color of the face but the obstruction which appeared in the region of the matrix whither the blood had flowed with too much precipitation and where it had contracted a powerful and wellknit body required the bleeding to be not in the foot but in the arm therefore it seems that had the patient been bled in the arm one might have thereby freed the lower parts that were gorged and as it were suffocated and by uncorking them one might have engaged them to yield readily to the desired evacuation dr friend however declares that he did not think fit to employ this remedy by reason of the weakness of the girl and because he apprehended by this means he might diminish instead of augmenting the blood but these are conjectures too weak and light to divert from the use of a remedy indicated in other respects by such pressing motives the weakness above all is not in itself as we have already shown a good reason to omit bleeding our author in his third observation gives us the history of a washerwoman of a sanguine complexion about twenty four years old who in washing with her terms upon her was seized with a fit of coldness she was also washing her legs with cold water wherefore the flux having been here reelld by the cold her terms disappeared or a year without any great apparent consequence dr friend accounts by her great fatigue and labors for the little rejudice this seemed to do her health ut about the end of the year she felt a ery considerable change such as a great heaviness and weakness the action of the tomach infeebled the function disordered  pain in almost all her limbs a cough a difficulty of breathing a paleness a sweling of her legs where so hard a tumor red that it was impossible by any plaster r cataplasm to soften it or to bring it o suppuration and her pulse became feele and languishing the patient would ave prevented all these accidents if at he time of her fluxs repercussion she ad got herself blooded in the foot according to the remark of lindanus and he reflections of etmuller dr friend who in all likelihood did not see the washerwoman but in the time of the inveerate suppression took from the tumor an ndication to make her be bled in the arm which he owns did no great good but bleeding in the foot though a long time after the interruption of the flux would perhap have had better success in regard to the source of the suppression which seems to require this bleeding and which we the more readily believe as the blood shows no appearance of gathering slakening and congestion in the uterine conduits and if it dont flow that way this seems to be net so much through any clog or impediment that might be there contracted as for want of its being determined toward those parts and what justifies this thought o mine is the remark it self of dr friend who explains how the suppression might have been so long a time inoffensive by the great exercise of the washerwoman which did not allow much time for the blood to sojourn stagnate corrupt and stick in the uterine region so tossed an jumbled as it was and by consequence rederd more transpirable by the woman agitation there seems then nothing her wanting to the blood but a proper determination toward the matrix which is favored and promoted by bleeding in the foo and that ought here to have been done according to the notions i offer which after all are but conjectures i venture to mak and submit with all my heart to the judgment of physicians among who dr friend shines in so distinguished a ran this able physician who judged it not covenient at first to use this bleeding did u t toward the end of the distemper after purgatives and emmenagogues to give the inishing stroke to the cure and so complete is work four or five days after this bleeding her terms appeared the patient ecovered her rosy color and all the acidents vanished now we have nothing eft to do but to apply to the emmenaogues the inconvenience that dr friend nds in bleeding in relation to the supressions this will pin up the basket and hew that his principles clash and that his system though displayed with all the clearess and proved with all the reasons that t is susceptible of dont appear well suported when says he after bellini cap    a eady removal of the blood follows after bleeding or when the blood is so rarefied that its particles are disunitedy and easily divided one from another this liquor acquires a velocity that fortifies its power because the animal spirits enlarged and free flow to the heart in a cheerful abundance and the blood broken and subtilizd makes less resistance against the action of the vessels but if no removal follows the quantity of the blood being abated the velocity is so likewise and so the blood loses of its force it were to be wished insinuates dr friend that bellini had established a constant token a certain sign of this constitution of the blood that suffers a removal by bleeding and of that other which does not suffer any thereby because for want of knowing this state and disposition of the blood the physician cannot be sure in what manner bleeding will change it and modify its motion for the better or the worse by reason of this uncertainty and doubtful success of bleeding we must abstain therefrom unless the violence of accidents enforce it for if in letting blood we render it more slow and compact not only fewer animal spirits will arise from it and so the stroke of the beating of the heart will be the more weak but the obstruction that afflicts the capillaries and holds em captives will gather new force therefore in the beginning of the suppression bleeding does not seem to be indicated unless one plainly sees the means to break infallibly the compact texture of the blood and to redouble its force by renewing its velocity let us examine according to his model the action of the emmenagogues that makes a part of the alteratives and then consider after cap    dr friend if the action is more certain and the success more allured how says he can the same force surmount such different resistances how can a remedy act in so uniform a manner when the subjects upon which it operates are so unlike there is nothing more ridiculous than to expect from a medicament a constant action a faithful energy an infallible and permanent virtue since it is not strange or epugnant for one and the same remedy o produce contrary effects suppose for example the disposition of the blood be uch that the greater part thereof is exremely vitiated and the lentor too obstiate to be conquered by the force of atteuants in this case if we apply a resoutive or subtilisant it has no effect but upon the thinner part of the blood which t melts and refines till it makes it pass in bundance through the strainers that is through he glands and the filtres of secretion so he most subtle or finest parts of the blood eing discharged by the force of the meicine the remainder of the mass will hereby be but the more compact thick and close do but observe how the diahoreticks those powerful attenuants do metimes even augment the lentor and he grossness of the humors as we see y experience quomodo enim eadem vis iversa long momenta queat pervincere uomodo similis semper esse posset agentis ergia cum it a dissimilis prorsus sit corpois in quod agitat natura constantem hanc medicamentis sperare efficaciam ita riiculum est ut nihil mirum sit si etiam ab dem medicamento educi possit effectus conarius concipiamus enim earn esse sanguiis crasin ut pars ejus long maxima insigniter lentescat cohaeret aeque in ea momentum validius sit quam quae ab attenuantium biribus resolvi queat in hoc casu si adhiveatur medicamentum resolvens eam quidem sanguinis partem quae minus lentescit ita fundit and attenuat ut per glandulas excretorias uberius extrudatur ita medicamenti vi eliminatis particulis tenuioribus crassior erit reliqui sanguinis compages ad hunc modum uti and docet experientia lentorem aliquando augent diaphoretica yet must we not exclude resolutives because of their doubtful success and uncertain issue dr friend makes often use of them without hesitation at the same time that he should either abstain from them or not use them but with such precautions as himself prescribes in bleeding we must beforehand be assured of the state of the blood know in that point what we have to go upon have tokens that denote the degre of lentor or viscidity requisite to be carried off by the emmenagogues as we a admonished that we must have some o these signs that mark to us the degree o thickness capable of being corrected by the bleeding for want of which the first reliefs are no more practicable than the last they are both alike uncertain then upon what account is the one preferred to the other this should have been cleared up dr friend should have instructed us in thi and in this as well as many other thing but for the death of the illustrious author we had reason to hope from him further lights he flatters himself that this fine phenomenon about the courses can no way be explained but by his principles yet i have ventured upon other principles and the system of the red part of the blood being engaged in the canals of its white part the prevailing opinion of dr helvetius and which he has so much illustrated on the subject of the small pox of which he has so learnedly and usefully treated a system which gives light into the explication of the hemorrhages and inflammations and which so perfectly agrees with the animal economy and natural mechanism this system i say yields in nothing to that which dr friend has given us not only as the best but as the only one from the principles i have already laid down every one may make his remarks upon the other parts of the authors book which i have not touched and it is likely that with ow much the more attention and care one shall apply to this the more the weakness of his reasoning will appear and the uncertainty of his hypothesis from the reflections that have been hitherto made t may be gathered that it is by no means an indifferent matter in practice to adopt indifferently the system of the rupture of the vessels or that of the intrusion of the blood into the lymphatick canals it is of the highest consequence to chufe either the one or the other to list on one side or the other and to appear more than ordinarily engaged or concerned therein if the dispute here was only about some insipid barren point of speculation amusing perhaps to the curious but altogether useless and without influence on practice those who regard things only as they are useful might perhaps slumber over it but as our business here is about a capital point which affects and concerns practice to the highest degree since in the two hypotheses the manner of cure is quite different this ought to awake the attention of all practitioners inspire them with an extraordinary relish for the present subject and rouse them totally out of their indifference some will perhaps attack the fundamental principle of these reflections which is that the blood owes its velocity to the impulse and systaltick virtue of the solids they will tell me that the vessels may be enormously distended and stretched to excess and still the fluid which they contain may move on with impetuosity by virtue of the medicaments that act upon it that break its texture bruise its mass correct its viscidity quicken its lentor and separate its parts whence may result an increase of its force a renewal of its velocity and all this independent of the oscillation of the vessels which still remain stretched constrained and as it were captive this has been proved by a number of experiments a mixture has been made of the blood newly drawn from the artery of a dog with several druggs which mixture has given occasion to various phenomenon the blood mixed with the spirit of salt armonic was of a beautiful red and fine consitence mixed with a decoction of savin or horehound it appeared of a deeper red and of a finer substance with sydenhams liquid laudanum it was of a brighter coour than with the decoction of savin though not of a much finer substance with the distilled water of rue or wormwood it ontinued very fluid from the first till the thirteenth of february a mixture was lso made of the serum of human blood with the tincture of aloes drawn with mint water with a decoction of savin a deoction of gentian spirit of tartar of saffron of turpentine of guaiacum and of hartshorn the oil of turpentine of guaiacum of lavender and of cloves by means of these druggs successively applied the serum held fluid many days but nothing rendered it near so fluid and so fine s the decoction of the jesuits bark we have been also assured of the working of medicines upon the blood by injections and intromissions into the body of a living animal we need but consult thereupon the   chap of the emmenology of dr friend which proves by unquestionable experiments that the blood is altered changed modified attenuated broken refined set in motion and rendered fluid by the power of emmenagogues therefore the fluid having another mover than the oscillation of the solid may be moved rapidly impetuously and precipitately even when this oscillation is languishing feeble and impotent therefore the blood may have the advantage of mass velocity pressure and percussion therefore the vessels being enormously dilated weakened and constrained may be forced by the action of the blood an action which it has independent of the vessels and from which they can draw no advantage a stroke consequently which it can give them without being accused of ingratitude and without incurring the odious reproach of turning it power against those who gave it this stroke the vessels will be unable to resist and be forced to yield to it broken disarmed and overwhelmed not by the power which they the vessels lend to the blood since they have none to lend but by that which the blood has borrowed elsewhere this is what may be objected against me and certainly i have given the objection al its weight and wish heartily it might screen dr friend from any attack i agree that medicines act upon the humors and inspire them with diverse qualities but it is proper to observe first that this is not always immediately nor without the participation of he solids the first operation of remeies inwardly taken is upon the stomach and thence spreads through the whole genus ervosum whereof this viscus is a part and consequently it is not strange that the tomach should transmit the modifications and the impressions which it receives the uickest operation of medicines and the riskest revolutions they cause are due to he sudden emotion which the solids acuire when they are affected by the mediines smoke raises the vapors and cures them the sprinkling of cold water the are taste of good wine recovers from a swoon recals the straying soul and reores the lost faculties remedies oftenimes make no change in the blood but by means of the solids which they first change and whose tone they alter so that they ecome more elastick or more moderate according to the action of the remedies that work and drive on the fluids with more r less heat whence ensues in the blood more or less refinement and celerity daiy experience proves the great share the solids have both in the disease and in the cure they are the lords of the animal economy the principle of every good and of every evil there  but now after those general undetermined ideas which it is good to advance let us descend to something more particular which more nearly regards the difficulty we have been forming upon this i have two reflections to make the first that the virtue of medicines has nothing at all to do with a state of health in the case of an ordinary and natural flowing the blood then makes its own way through the tunicks of the vessels yet is not put in motion nor pushed nor made fluent refined and fluid by the power of the medicines therefore if it has celerity it owes this to the oscillation of the solids which with redoubled strokes of systole impart to it its present motion and accelerate its flowing for i believe it will be granted without difficulty that the blood which is not broken agitated and attenuated by remedies can be no otherwise so but by the means of the vessels so that if it is in action it must owe this action solely to the spring and vibration of the solids what other cause on the present hypothesis can move the blood what other mover what other principle can give any other ways agitation to this fluid does it move itself has it in its own stock wherewitha to put itself in play does it draw its power from its own choice i appeal to dr friend himself who undermines the foundation of the bloods intestine power and who from the beginning of his work gives a mortal blow to the fermentation already so much discredited and the finishing stroke to the disgrace of this unhappy hypothesis by the desolating refusal of his protection to it leaving it helpless in black despair and reducing it to a condition utterly abandoned the absurd hypothesis says he of the fermentations and leavens is scarce any more in vogue it is even a long time since the soundest part of the learned have banished it out of their writings sed exolevit fere hodie absurda illa de fermentis doctrina and a sanissimis saltem scriptoribus jamdiu explosa est see then this idol of the new physic and of the modern philosophy neglected abandoned overwhelmed what a spectacle a doctrine which attracted such a crowd of partisans ecomes deserted and forlorn the predominant hypothesis the sovereign doctrine the reigning opinion is falling into widowhood into contempt and slavery is made a tributary languishing in obscurity and sighing all alone finding none to comfort her in her misery and to raise her from the ground where she miserably grovels even those that listed under her standard are ashamed to defend her cause quit her side and leave her in the lurch the ways by which it was pretended to explain all the animal economy ways beaten and rebeaten with so much pomp and solemnity are now no more frequented the niches of the ferments are destroyed and the ferments even the instruments of fermentation are taken from her poor thing she has not allowed her a space ample enough to make her pushes and her sallies in pent in canals too straight in places too close for her where she undergoes the cruelty of being oppressed and stifled destitute in these inextricable difficulties of all relief and unable to defend herself all her charms are fled from her and her armed adversaries have laid violent hands on all that belongs to her depriving her of all that she can desire or that can give her any advantage o ye that have run through all the different hypotheses consider if there is one of em all so cruelly treated and that languishes in a situation so very deplorable as hers what says one the doctrine of the ferments is no more in use and the literati have hissed it off the stage sad case is this the fermentation that a while ago made such a figure can you know her again by this picture you that used so to idolize her you that still are so fond of her is it possible sirs that this can be the object of your delight and tenderest addresses this offal this may game this bitch with a bottle at her tail can this be your favorite mistress can you own this your idol in so disguised a metamorphosis fermentation is then in disgrace with dr friend and according to him with al the best authors too then he cannot admi in the blood a virtue proper to make it circulate it is therefore allowed to believe that the motion the swiftness of the blood in the natural state of health is the effect of the action of the vessels that press push and hurry it and the acknowledgment of dr friend who rejects this fermentation eads to this thought conducts to this consequence this just comes to what we ave been demonstrating that the blood cannot make an ill use of the celerity which t has from the vessels thereby to break hese whence it follows either that the erms can never naturally flow without he aid of medicines or that the velocity f the blood is not necessary to the flux ut is even contrary to it if the fluid aturally holds its celerity from the solid which hastens its way and if by virtue f this celerity the fluid cannot break the olid as has been proved then of neessity nature alone cannot push the terms nless it be the abundance and not the vecity of the blood that makes em flow et dr friend makes the principal mover f the flux to consist in the swiftness of e blood and the principal hinderance and ordinary cause of the suppression to onsist in its slowness so that it does not em possible on the principles of this auor to explain how the flowing of the erms is procured by nature alone the econd reflection i have to make is that the fluids attenuated bruised and broken by the force of emmenagogues do not so strongly oppose the action of the solids the blood rendered supple flowing and docile by these medicaments suffers itself to be led subdued and jerkd along by the vessels which finding no more as before an invincible obstacle in the gross and compact mass that the remedies have reduced and subtilizd recover their ease resume their vigor and set themselves at liberty whence we see that the emmenagogues at the same time that they set the bloo at large set also the vessels at their ease too now being at their ease it is evident that they are not so liable to b broken yet the blood upon which the remedies act might be so abundant tha it could not swell and rarify without forcing the canals to burst in this case if the medicines melt and rarify it it seems tha they will infallibly occasion the breaking  the vascular tunicks which as they cannot stretch any further must needs crac but we have observed that the blood arivd to such a pitch of abundance to such  degree of grossness is not fit to be wroug upon by attenuants because these can la no hold of it we have observed in the circumstance the usefulness and even the necessity of bleeding to set the attenuan at work therefore in an excessive pthora in an extreme viscidity emmengogues being equally as impotent as the vessels are as little able to do any thing as these are that which hinders these from strongly contracting hinders also those from fastening upon the thickened humors whence it seems to follow that the blood cannot apply even the velocity which it receives from the emmenagogues to break the vessels because the remedies cannot animate it so much as it should be but with the assistance of the elastick vessels they do not indeed import fluidity but this is not progressive motion the motion of circulation which is not to be obtained but by the systaltick virtue of the vessels the blood attenuated by emmenagogues may well become fluid but it cannot acquire velocity save only by being pushed beaten and jerkd along according to dr friend the stroke of the blood is that which makes its greatest strength now the stroke that is to say the briskness of the shock the violence of the percussion does not precisely come from the fluidity but because the fluid is strongly struck upon by the solid which blows it again retaliates and in its turn rebuffets the solid therefore if the vessels were flat and unactive in torture and in captivity and the fluids left to the sole action of the attenuants these fluids would not receive force enough wherewith to strike upon the solids they would acquire but an indolent fluidity only a disunion of their parts a dissolution of their mass incapable of any great effects they could not contract that impetuosity necessary to give strength to their blow briskness to their shock power and force to their percussion our author himself deduces the velocity of the blood from the vehement pulsation of the heart and of the arteries a pulsation produced as he says by the affluence of the animal spirits whereas these animal spirits themselves can be nothing but the work and effect of the spring of those parts that agitate and push them to the degree of fineness which they have therefore the velocity of the blood is the effect of the expulsion of the vessels wherefore it cannot make use thereof to break them therefore if emmenagogues excite the flux of the menses this cannot be by the velocity which they impart to the blood but rather by the swelling the rarefaction the disorderly turgescence which they produce therein by the means of which the vascular tunicks give way not to the force of the percussion but to the excess of their own dilation another difficulty might be started against me the vessels in the effort they make to drive on with swiftness and percipitation the blood subjected to their power may they not break themselves are they not even more liable to be broken being active than unactive by exercise than indolence by fatigue than repose are not they who labor hardest most exposed to the misfortune of bursting veins and arteries have not we seen vessels broken by the shocks of a violent cough and the cruellest hemorrhages produced by the heat of a burning summer it is not therefore strange that the uterine vessels though vigorous enough to animate the blood should yield to the blow of which themselves are the cause and their vigor far from fortifying and defending them against their burstng only renders them more proper more fit and disposed for it i own the vessels may be roken by their own pains and fatigue but t must be also confessed that it is by accident when this misfortune happens and that these are cases for which none undertakes to give nvariable rules and geometrical demontrations such as dr friend has attempted to give us there is too much uncertainty in the rupture of the vessels and it is too fortuitous a case to draw and deduce thence an effect o sure so constant so natural so regular as the phenomenon of the monthly courses besides the rupture of the vessels is not a thing so common as one imagines bleeding at the nose spitting of blood accidents very frequent and vulgarly attributed to ruptures dont so much denote broken vessels but rather such as meet discharging canals that terminate in the sanguines and do not so much declare the extravasation of the blood as its passage into the emunctories why indeed so few ruptures in the slenderest tenderest fibers within the body which are remote from places of discharge whilst we discover so many and so often just by the issues near the excretories and in the blood vessels most within the reach of the outlets most known and best remarked this observation justly intimates that which is attributed to the rupture of the canals is usually but the effect of the intrusion of the blood into the lymphaticks these seem to me the strongest objections that can be made against me and the proper answers to be made to them dr freinds system therefore cannot be defended and still lies under the same difficulties  yet after all cannot flatter myself that i have with any solidity taken up so learned a man as dr friend what i have hitherto advanced i look upon it rather as a web of objections to be answered than as a criticism to be redoubted if i have not attacked my author with advantage i shall at least have the glory of having studied him with application it is always good to betake ourselves to the best authors it is pleasant to contemplate their beauties and even when we attack them unsuccessfully yet dont we apply thereto without reaping an advantage but should my objections be made with some foundation i would not take it amiss to be compared to a rebellious child who battles its own nurse because by her succulent and wellconditiond milk she has supplied him with the strength to do it fostered by the reading of dr friend imbued with his lessons improved by his knowledge enlightened by his light i have made use thereof against himself i own i should have had no success in engaging him if i had not improved by studying him if i had not gathered my knowledge from reading and meditating him and if before i made war upon him i had not learnt my discipline under him if we gain a victory over good authors it is because themselves supply us with the means to gain it  finis
