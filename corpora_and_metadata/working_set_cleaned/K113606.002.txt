given an account of the earth in general and the advantages and inconveniences with which it abounds we now come to consider it more minutely having described the habitation we are naturally led to enquire after the inhabitants amidst the infinitely different productions which the earth offers and with which it is every where covered animals hold the first rank as well because of the finer formation of their parts as of their superior power the vegetable which is fixed to one spot and obliged to wait for its accidental supplies of nourishment may be considered as the prisoner of nature unable to correct the disadvantages of its situation or to shield itself from the dangers that surround it every object that has motion may be its destroyer  but animals are endowed with powers of motion and defense the greatest part are capable by changing place of commanding nature and of thus obliging her to furnish that nourishment which is most agreeable to their state those few that are fixed to one spot even in this seemingly helpless situation are nevertheless protected from external injury by an hard shelly covering which they often can close at pleasure and thus defend themselves from every assault and here i think we may draw the line between the animal and vegetable kingdoms every animal by some means or other finds protection from injury either from its force or courage its swiftness or cunning some are protected by hiding in convenient places and others by taking refuge in an hard resisting shell but vegetables are totally unprotected they are exposed to every assailant and patiently submissive in every attack in a word an animal is an organized being that is in some measure provided for its own security a vegetable is destitute of every protection  but though it is very easy without the help of definitions to distinguish a plant from an animal yet both possess many properties so much alike that the two kingdoms as they are called seem mixed with each other hence it frequently puzzles the naturalist to tell exactly where animal life begins and vegetative terminates nor indeed is it easy to resolve whether some objects offered to view be of the lowest of the animal or the highest of the vegetable races the sensitive plant that moves at the touch seems to have as much perception as the fresh water polypus that is possessed of a still flower share of motion besides the sensitive plant will not reproduce upon cutting in pieces which the polypus is known to do so that the vegetable production seems to have the superiority but notwithstanding this the polypus hunts for its food as most other animals do it changes its situation and therefore possesses a power of choosing its food or retreating from danger still therefore the animal kingdom is far removed above the vegetable and its lowest denizen is possessed of very great privileges when compared with the plants with which it is often surrounded  however both classes have many resemblances by which they are raised above the unorganized and inert masses of nature minerals are mere inactive insensible bodies entirely motionless of themselves and waiting some external force to alter their forms or their properties but it is otherwise with animals and vegetables these are endued with life and vigor they have their state of improvement and decay they are capable of reproducing their kinds they grow from seeds in some and from cuttings in others they seem all possessed of sensation in a greater or less degree they both have their enmities and affections and as some animals are by nature impelled to violence so some plants are found to exterminate all others and make a wilderness of the places round them as the lion makes a desert of the forest where it resides thus no other plant will grow under the shade of the machineltree thus also that plant in the west indies called caraguata clings round whatever tree it happens to approach there it quickly gains the ascendant and loading the same with a verdure not its own keeps away that nourishment designed to feed the trunk and at last entirely destroys its supporter  as all animals are ultimately supported upon vegetables so vegetables are greatly propagated by being made a part of animal food birds distribute the seeds wherever they fly and quadrupeds prune them into greater luxuriance by these means the quantity of food in a state of nature is kept equal to the number of the consumers and lest some of the weaker ranks of animals should find nothing for their support but all the provisions be devoured by the strong different vegetables are appropriated to different appetites if transgressing this rule the stronger ranks should invade the rights of the weak and breaking through all regard to appetite should make an indiscriminate use of every vegetable nature then punishes the transgression and poison marks the crime as capital  if again we compare vegetables and animals with respect to the places where they are found we shall find them bearing a still stronger similitude the vegetables that grow in a dry and sunny soil are strong and vigorous though not luxuriant so also are the animals of such a climate those on the contrary that are the joint product of heat and moisture are luxuriant and tender and the animals assimilating to the vegetable food on which they ultimately subsist are much larger in such places than in others thus in the internal parts of southamerica and africa where the sun usually scorches all above while inundations cover all below the insects reptiles and other animals grow to a prodigious size the earthworm of america is often a yard in length and as thick as a walking cane the boiguacu which is the largest of the serpent kind is sometimes forty feet in length the bats in those countries are as big as a rabbit the toads are bigger than a duck and their spiders are as large as a sparrow on the contrary in the cold frozen regions of the north where vegetable nature is stinted of its growth the few animals in those climates partake of the diminution all the wild animals except the bear are much smaller than in milder countries and such of the domestic kinds as are carried thither quickly degenerate and grow less their very insects are of the minute kinds their bees and spiders being not half so large as those in the temperate zone  the similitude between vegetables and animals is no where more obvious than in those that belong to the ocean where the nature of one is admirably adapted to the necessities of the other this element it is well known has its vegetables and its insects that feed upon them in great abundance over many tracts of the sea a weed is seen floating which covers the surface and gives the resemblance of a green and extensive meadow on the under side of these unstable plants millions of little animals are found adapted to their situation for as their ground if i may so express it lies over their heads their feet are placed upon their backs and as land animals have their legs below their bodies these have them above at land also most animals are furnished with eyes to see their food but at sea almost all the reptile kinds are without eyes which might only give them prospects of danger at a time when unprovided with the means of escaping it linnaei amaenitates vol v p      thus in all places we perceive an obvious similitude between the animals and the vegetables of every region in general however the most perfect races have the least similitude to the vegetable productions on which they are ultimately fed while on the contrary the meaner the animal the more local it is found to be and the more it is influenced by the varieties of the soil where it resides many of the more humble reptile kinds are not only confined to one country but also to a plant nay even to a leaf upon that they subsist increase with its vegetation and seem to decay as it declines they are merely the circumscribed inhabitants of a single vegetable take them from that and they instantly die being entirely assimilated to the plant they feed on assuming its color and even its medicinal properties for this reason there are infinite numbers of the meaner animals that we have never an opportunity of seeing in this part of the world they are incapable of living separate from their kindred vegetables which grow only in a certain climate  such animals as are formed more perfect lead a life of less dependence and some kinds are found to subsist in many parts of the world at the same time but of all the races of animated nature man is the least affected by the soil where he resides and least influenced by the variations of vegetable sustenance equally unaffected by the luxuriance of the warm climates or the sterility of the poles he has spread his habitations over the whole earth and finds subsistence as well amidst the ice of the north as the burning deserts under the line all creatures of an inferior nature as has been said have peculiar propensities to peculiar climates they are circumscribed to zones and confined to territories where their proper food is found in greatest abundance but man may be called the animal of every climate and suffers but very gradual alterations from the nature of any situation  as to animals of a meaner rank whom man compels to attend him in his migrations these being obliged to live in a state of constraint and upon vegetable food often different from that of their native soil they very soon alter their natures with the nature of their nourishment assimilate to the vegetables upon which they are fed and thus assume very different habits as well as appearances thus man unaffected himself alters and directs the nature of other animals at his pleasure increases their strength for his delight or their patience for his necessities  and this power of altering the appearances of things seems to have been given him for very wise purposes the deity when he made the earth was willing to give his favored creature many opponents that might at once exercise his virtues and call forth his latent abilities hence we find in those wide uncultivated wildernesses where man in his savage state owns inferior strength and the beasts claim divided dominion that the whole forest swarms with noxious animals and vegetables animals as yet undescribed and vegetables which want a name in those recesses nature seems rather lavish than magnificent in bestowing life the trees are usually of the largest kinds covered round with parasite plants and interwoven at the tops with each other the boughs both above and below are peopled with various generations some of which have never been upon the ground and others that have never stirred from the branches on which they were produced in this manner millions of minute and loathsome creatures pursue a round of uninterrupted existence and enjoy a life scarce superior to vegetation at the same time the vegetables in those places are of the larger kinds while the animal race is of the smaller but man has altered this disposition of nature having in a great measure levelled the extensive forests cultivated the softer and finer vegetables destroyed the numberless tribes of minute and noxious animals and taken every method to increase a numerous breed of the larger kinds he thus has exercised a severe control unpeopled nature to embellish it and diminished the size of vegetable in order to improve that of the animal kingdom  to subdue the earth to his own use was and ought to be the aim of man which was only to be done by increasing the number of plants and diminishing that of animals to multiply existence alone was that of the deity for this reason we find in a state of nature that animal life is increased to the greatest quantity possible and we can scarce form a system that could add to its numbers first plants or trees are provided by nature of the largest kinds and consequently the nourishing surface is thus extended in the second place there are animals peculiar to every part of the vegetable so that no part of it is lost but the greatest possible increase of life would still be deficient were there not other animals that lived upon animals themselves and these are themselves in turn food for some other greater and stronger set of creatures were all animals to live upon vegetables alone thousands would be extinct that now have existence as the quantity of their provision would shortly fail but as things are wisely constituted one animal now supports another and thus all take up less room than they would by living on the same food as to make use of a familiar instance a greater number of people may be crowded into the same space if each is made to bear his fellow upon his shoulders  to diminish the number of animals and increase that of vegetables has been the general scope of human industry and if we compare the utility of the kinds with respect to man we shall find that of the vast variety in the animal kingdom but very few are serviceable to him and in the vegetable but very few are entirely noxious how small a part of the insect tribes for instance are beneficial to mankind and what numbers are injurious in some countries they almost darken the air a candle cannot be lighted without their instantly flying upon it and putting out the flame ulloas description of guayaquil  the closest recesses are no safeguard from their annoyance and the most beautiful landscapes of nature only serve to invite their rapacity as these are injurious from their multitudes so most of the larger kinds are equally dreadful to him from their courage and ferocity in the most uncultivated parts of the forest these maintain an undisputed empire and man invades their retreats with terror these are terrible and there are still more that are utterly useless to him that serve to take up that room which more beneficial creatures might possess and incommode him rather with their numbers than their enmities thus in a catalogue of land animals that amounts to more than twenty thousand we can scarcely reckon up an hundred that are any way useful to him the rest being either all his open or his secret enemies immediately attacking him in person or intruding upon that food he has appropriated to himself vegetables on the contrary though existing in greater variety are but few of them noxious the most deadly poisons are often of great use in medicine and even those plants that only seem to cumber the ground serve for food to that race of animals which he has taken into friendship or protection the smaller tribes of vegetables in particular are cultivated as contributing either to his necessities or amusement so that vegetable life is as much promoted by human industry as animal life is controlled and diminished  hence it was not without a long struggle and various combinations of experience and art that man acquired his present dominion almost every good that he possesses was the result of the contest for every day as he was contending he was growing more wise and patience and fortitude were the fruits of his industry  from hence also we see the necessity of some animals living upon each other to fill up the plan of providence and we may consequently infer the expediency of mans living upon all both animals and vegetables seem equally fitted to his appetites and were any religious or moral motives to restrain him from taking away life upon any account he would only thus give existence to a variety of beings made to prey upon each other and instead of preventing he would only thus multiply mutual destruction  chap ii of the generation of animals before we survey animals in their state of maturity and performing the functions adapted to their respective natures method requires that we should consider them in the more early periods of their existence there was a time when the proudest and the noblest animal was a partaker of the same imbecility with the meanest reptile and while yet a candidate for existence was equally helpless and contemptible in their incipient state all are upon a footing the insect and the philosopher being equally insensible clogged with matter and unconscious of existence where then are we to begin with the history of those beings that make such a distinguished figure in the creation or where lie those peculiar characters in the parts that go to make up animated nature that mark one animal as destined to creep in the dust and another to glitter on the throne  this has been a subject that has employed the curiosity of all ages and the philosophers of every age have attempted the solution in tracing up nature to her most hidden recesses she becomes too minute or obscure for our inspection so that we find it impossible to mark her first differences to discover the point where animal life begins or the cause that conduces to set it in motion we know little more than that the greatest number of animals require the concurrence of a male and female to reproduce their kind and that these distinctly and invariably are found to beget creatures of their own species curiosity has therefore been active in trying to discover the immediate result of this union how far either sex contributes to the bestowing animal life and whether it be to the male or female that we are most indebted for the privilege of our existence  hippocrates has supposed that fecundity proceeded from the mixture of the seminal liquor of both sexes each of which equally contribute to the formation of the incipient animal aristotle on the other hand would have the seminal liquor in the male alone to contribute to this purpose while the female supplied the proper nourishment for its support such were the opinions of these fathers of philosophy and these continued to be adopted by the naturalists and schoolmen of succeeding ages with blind veneration at length steno and harvey taking anatomy for their guide gave mankind a nearer view of nature just advancing into animation these perceived in all such animals as produced their young alive two glandular bodies near the womb resembling that ovary or cluster of small eggs which is found in fowls and from the analogy between both they gave these also the name of ovaria these as they resembled eggs they naturally concluded had the same offices and therefore they were induced to think that all animals of what kind soever were produced from eggs at first however there was some altercations raised against this system for as these ovaria were separate from the womb it was objected that they could not be any way instrumental in replenishing that organ with which they did not communicate but upon more minute inspection fallopius the anatomist perceived two tubular vessels depending from the womb which like the horns of a snail had a power of erecting themselves of embracing the ovaria and of receiving the eggs in order to be fecundated by the seminal liquor this discovery seemed for a long time after to fix the opinions of philosophers the doctrine of hippocrates was reestablished and the chief business of generation was ascribed to the female this was for a long time the established opinion of the schools but lowenhoeck once more shook the whole system and produced a new schism among the lovers of speculation upon examining the seminal liquor of a great variety of male animals with microscopes which helped his sight more than that of any of his successors he perceived therein infinite numbers of little living creatures like tadpoles very brisk and floating in the fluid with a seeming voluntary motion each of these therefore was thought to be the rudiments of an animal similar to that from which it was produced and this only required a reception from the female together with proper nourishment to complete its growth the business of generation was now therefore given back to the male a second time by many while others suspended their assent and chose rather to confess ignorance than to embrace error bonets considerations sur corpse organizes   in this manner has the dispute continued for several ages some accidental discovery serving at intervals to renew the debate and revive curiosity it was a subject where speculation could find much room to display itself and mr buffon who loved to speculate would not omit such an opportunity of giving scope to his propensity according to this most pleasing of all naturalists the microscope discovers that the seminal liquor not only of males but of females also abounds in these moving little animals which have been mentioned above and that they appear equally brisk in either fluid these he takes not to be real animals but organical particles which being simple cannot be said to be organized themselves but which go to the composition of all organized bodies whatsoever in the same manner as a tooth in the wheel of a watch cannot be called either the wheel or the watch and yet contributes to the sum of the machine these organical particles are according to him diffused throughout all nature and to be found not only in the seminal liquor but in most other fluids in the parts of vegetables and all parts of animated nature as they happen therefore to be differently applied they serve to constitute a part of the animal or the vegetable whose growth they serve to increase while the superfluity is thrown off in the seminal liquor of both sexes for the reproduction of other animals or vegetables of the same species these particles assume different figures according to the receptacle into which they enter falling into the womb they unite into a foetus beneath the bark of a tree they pullulate into branches and in short the same particles that first formed the animal in the womb contribute to increase its growth when brought forth mr buffon   to this system it has been objected that it is impossible to conceive organical substances without being organized and that if divested of organization themselves they could never make an organized body as an infinity of circles could never make a triangle it has been objected that it is more difficult to conceive the transformation of these organical particles than even that of the animal whose growth we are enquiring after and this system therefore attempts to explain one obscure thing by another still more obscure  but an objection still stronger than these has been advanced by an ingenious countryman of our own who asserts that these little animals which thus appear swimming and sporting in almost every fluid we examine with a microscope are not real living particles but some of the more opake parts of the fluid that are thus increased in size and seem to have a much greater motion than they have in reality for the motion being magnified with the object the smallest degree of it will seem very considerable and a being almost at rest may by these means be apparently put into violent action thus for instance if we look upon the sails of a windmill moving at a distance they appear to go very slow but if we approach them and thus magnify their bulk to our eye they go round with great rapidity a microscope in the same manner serves to bring our eye close to the object and thus to enlarge it and not only increase the magnitude of its parts but of its motion hence therefore it would follow that these organical particles that are said to constitute the bulk of living nature are but mere optical illusions and the system founded on them must like them be illusive  these and many other objections have been made to this system which instead of enlightening the mind serve only to show that too close a pursuit of nature chiefly leads to uncertainty happily however for mankind the most intricate enquiries are generally the most useless instead therefore of balancing accounts between the sexes and attempting to ascertain to which the business of generation most properly belongs it will be more instructive as well as amusing to begin with animal nature from its earliest retirements and evanescent outlines and pursue the incipient creature through all its changes in the womb till it arrives into open day  the usual distinction of animals with respect to their manner of generation has been into the oviparous and viviparous kinds or in other words into those that bring forth an egg which is afterward hatched into life and those that bring forth their young alive and perfect in one of these two ways all animals were supposed to have been produced and all other kinds of generation were supposed imaginary or erroneous but later discoveries have taught us to be more cautious in making general conclusions and have even induced many to doubt whether animal life may not be produced merely from putrefaction bonet consid p  00   indeed the infinite number of creatures that putrid substances seem to give birth to and the variety of little insects seen floating in liquors by the microscope appear to favor this opinion but however this may be the former method of classing animals can now by no means be admitted as we find many animals that are produced neither from the womb nor from the shell but merely from cuttings so that to multiply life in some creatures it is sufficient only to multiply the dissection this being the simplest method of generation and that in which life seems to require the smallest preparation for its existence i will begin with it and so proceed to the two other kinds from the meanest to the most elaborate  the earthworm the millipedes the seaworm and many marine insects may be multiplied by being cut in pieces but the polypus is noted for its amazing fertility and from hence it will be proper to take the description the structure of the polypus may be compared to the finger of a glove open at one end and closed at the other the closed end represents the tail of the polypus with which it serves to fix itself to any substance it happens to be upon the open end may be compared to the mouth and if we conceive six or eight small strings issuing from this end we shall have a proper idea of its arms which it can erect lengthen and contract at pleasure like the horns of a snail this creature is very voracious and makes use of its arms as a fisherman does of his net to catch and entangle such little animals as happen to come within its reach it lengthens these arms several inches keeps them separated from each other and thus occupies a large space in the water in which it resides these arms when extended are as fine as threads of silk and have a most exquisite degree of feeling if a small worm happens to get within the sphere of their activity it is quickly entangled by one of these arms and soon after the other arms come to its aid these altogether shortening the worm is drawn into the animals mouth and quickly devoured coloring the body as it is swallowed thus much is necessary to be observed of this animals method of living to show that it is not of the vegetable tribe but a real animal performing the functions which other animals are found to perform and endued with powers that many of them are destistute of but what is most extraordinary remains yet to be told for if examined with a microscope there are seen several little specks like buds that seem to pullulate from different parts of its body and these soon after appear to be young polypi themselves and like the large polypus begin to cast their little arms about for prey in the same manner whatever they happen to ensnare is devoured and gives a color not only to their own bodies but to that of the parent so that the same food is digested and serves for the nourishment of both the food of the little one passes into the large polypus and colors its body and this in its turn digests and swallows its food to pass into theirs in this manner every polypus has a new colony sprouting from its body and these new ones even while attached to the parent animal become parents themselves having a smaller colony also budding from them all at the same time busily employed in seeking for their prey and the food of any one of them serving for the nourishment and circulating through the bodies of all the rest this society however is every hour dissolving those newly produced are seen at intervals to leave the body of the large polypus and become shortly after the head of a beginning colony themselves  in this manner the polypus multiplies naturally but one may take a much readier and shorter way to increase them and this only by cutting them in pieces though cut into thousands of parts each part still retains its vivacious quality each shortly becomes a distinct and a complete polypus whether cut lengthways or crossways it is all the same this extraordinary creature seems a gainer by our endeavors and multiplies by apparent destruction the experiment has been tried times without number and still attended with the same success here therefore naturalists who have been blamed for the cruelty of their experiments upon living animals may now boast of their increasing animal life instead of destroying it the production of the polypus is a kind of philosophical generation the famous sir thomas brown hoped one day to be able to produce children by the same method as trees are produced the polypus is multiplied in this manner and every philosopher may thus if he pleases boast of a very numerous though i should suppose a very useless progeny  this method of generation from cuttings may be considered as the most simple kind and is a strong instance of the little pains nature takes in the formation of her lower and humbler productions as the removal of these from inanimate into animal existence is but small there are but few preparations made for their journey no organs of generation seem provided no womb to receive no shell to protect them in in their state of transition the little reptile is quickly fitted for all the offices of its humble sphere and in a very short time arrives at the height of its contemptible perfection  the next generation is of those animals that we see produced from the egg in this manner all birds most fishes and many of the insect tribes are brought forth an egg may be considered as a womb detached from the body of the parent animal in which the embryo is but just beginning to be formed it may be regarded as a kind of incomplete delivery in which the animal is disburthened of its young before its perfect formation fishes and insects indeed most usually commit the care of their eggs to hazard but birds which are more perfectly formed are found to hatch them into maturity by the warmth of their bodies however any other heat of the same temperature would answer the end as well for either the warmth of the sun or of a stove is equally efficacious in bringing the animal in the egg to perfection in this respect therefore we may consider generation from the egg as inferior to that in which the animal is brought forth alive nature has taken care of the viviparous animal in every stage of its existence that force which separates it from the parent separates it from life and the embryo is shielded with unceasing protection till it arrives at exclusion but it is different with the little animal in the egg often totally neglected by the parent and always separable from it every accident may retard its growth or even destroy its existence besides art or accident also may bring this animal to a state of perfection so that it can never be considered as a complete work of nature in which so much is left for accident to finish or destroy  but however inferior this kind of generation may be the observation of it will afford great insight into that of nobler animals as we can here watch the progress of the growing embryo in every period of its existence and catch it in those very moments when it first seems stealing into motion malpighi and haller have been particularly industrious on this subject and with a patience almost equalling that of the sitting hen have attended incubation in all its stages from them therefore we have an amazing history of the chicken in the egg and of its advances into complete formation  it would be methodically tedious to describe those parts of the egg which are well known and obvious such as its shell its white and its yolk but the disposition of these is not so apparent immediately under the shell lies that common membrane or skin which lines it on the inside adhereing closely to it every where except at the broad end where a little cavity is left that is filled with air which increases as the animal within grows larger under this membrane are contained two whites though seeming to us to be only one each wrapped up in a membrane of its own one white within the other in the midst of all is the yolk wrapped round likewise in its own membrane at each end of this are two ligaments called chalazae which are as it were the poles of this microcosm being white dense substances made from the membranes and serving to keep the white and the yolk in their places it was the opinion of mr derham that they served also for another purpose for a line being drawn from one ligament to the other would not pass directly through the middle of the yolk but rather toward one side and would divide the yolk into two unequal parts by which means these ligaments served to keep the smallest side of the yolk always uppermost and in this part he supposed the cicatricula or first speck of life to reside which by being upermost and consequently next the hen would be thus in the warmest situation but this is rather fanciful than true the incipient animal being found in all situations and not particularly influenced by any haller  this cicatricula which is the part where the animal first begins to show signs of life is not unlike a vetch or a lentil lying on one side of the yolk and within its membrane all these contribute to the little animals convenience or support the outer membranes and ligaments preserve the fluids in their proper places the white serves as nourishment and the yolk with its membranes after a time becomes a part of the animals body haller  this is the description of an hens egg and answers to that of all others how large or how small soever  previous to putting the eggs to the hen our philosophers first examined the cicatricula or little spot already mentioned and which may be considered as the most important part of the egg this was found in those that were impregnated by the cock to be large but in those laid without the cock very small it was found by the microscope to be a kind of bag containing a transparent liquor in the midst of which the embryo was seen to reside the embryo resembled a composition of little threads which the warmth of future incubation tended to enlarge by varying and liquifying the other fluids contained within the shell and thus pressing them either into the pores or tubes of their substance  upon placing the eggs in a proper warmth malpighi  either under the sun or in a stove after six hours the vital speck begins to dilate like the pupil of the eye the head of the chicken is distinctly seen with the backbone something resembling a tadpole floating in its ambient fluid but as yet seeming to assume none of the functions of animal life in about six hours more the little animal is seen more distinctly the head becomes more plainly visible and the vertebrae of the back more easily perceivable all these signs of preparation for life are increased in six hours more and at the end of twentyfour hours the ribs begin to take their places the neck begins to lengthen and the head to turn to one side  at this time harvey  also the fluids in the egg seem to have changed place the yolk which was before in the center of the shell approaches nearer to the broad end the watery part of the white is in some measure evaporated through the shell and the grosser part sinks to the small end the little animal appears to turn toward the part of the broad end in which a cavity has been described and with its yolk seems to adhere to the membrane there at the end of forty hours the great work of life seems fairly begun and the animal plainly appears to move the backbone which is of a whitish color thickens the head is turned still more on one side the first rudiments of the eyes begin to appear the heart beats and the blood begins already to circulate the parts however as yet are fluid but by degrees become more and more tenacious and harden into a kind of jelly at the end of two days the liquor in which the chicken swims seems to increase the head appears with two little bladders in the place of eyes the heart beats in the manner of every embryo where the blood does not circulate through the lungs in about fourteen hours after this the chicken is grown more strong its head however is still bent downwards the veins and the arteries begin to branch in order to form the brain and the spinal marrow is seen stretching along the back bone in three days the whole body of the chicken appears bent the head with its two eye balls with their different humors now distinctly appear and five other vesicles are seen which soon unite to form the rudiments of the brain the outlines also of the thighs and wings begin to be seen and the body begins to gather flesh at the end of the fourth day the vesicles that go to form the brain approach each other the wings and thighs appear more solid the whole body is covered with a jelly like flesh the heart that was hitherto exposed is now covered up within the body by a very thin transparent membrane and at the same time the umbilical vessels that unite the animal to the yolk now appear to come forth from the abdomen after the fifth and sixth days the vessels of the brain begin to be covered over the wings and thighs lengthen the belly is closed up and tumid the liver is seen within it very distinctly not yet grown red but of a very dusky white both the ventricles of the heart are discerned as if they were two separate hearts beating distinctly the whole body of the animal is covered over and the traces of the incipient feathers are already to be seen the seventh day the head appears very large the brain is covered entirely over the bill begins to appear betwixt the eyes and the wings the thighs and the legs have acquired their perfect figure haller  hitherto however the animal appears as if it had two bodies the yolk is joined to it by the umbilical vessels that come from the belly and is furnished with its vessels through which the blood circulates as through the rest of the body of the chicken making a bulk greater than that of the animal itself but toward the end of incubation the umbilical vessels shorten the yolk and with it the intestines are thrust up into the body of the chicken by the action of the muscles of the belly and the two bodies are thus formed into one during this state all the organs are found to perform their secretions the bile is found to be separated as in grown animals but it is fluid transparent and without bitterness and the chicken then also appears to have lungs on the tenth the muscles of the wings appear and the feathers begin to push out on the eleventh the heart which hitherto had appeared divided begins to unite the arteries which belong to it join into it like the fingers into the palm of the hand all these appearances only come more into view because the fluids the vessels had hitherto secreted were more transparent but as the color of the fluids deepen their operations and circulations are more distinctly seen as the animal thus by the eleventh day completely formed begins to gather strength it becomes more uneasy in its situation and exerts its animal powers with increasing force for some time before it is able to break the shell in which it is imprisoned it is heard to chirrup receiving a sufficient quantity of air for this purpose from that cavity which lies between the membrane and the shell and which must contain air to resist the external pressure at length upon the twentieth day in some birds sooner and later in others the enclosed animal breaks the shell within which it has been confined with its beak and by repeated efforts at last procures its enlargement  from this little history we perceive that those parts which are most conducive to life are the first that are begun the head and the backbone which no doubt enclose the brain and the spinal marrow though both are too limpid to be discerned are the first that are seen to exist the beating of the heart is perceived soon after the less noble parts seem to spring from these the wings the thighs the feet and lastly the bill whatever therefore the animal has double or whatever it can live without the use of these are latest in production nature first sedulously applying to the formation of the nobler organs without which life would be of short continuance and would be begun in vain  the resemblance between the beginning animal in the egg and the embryo in the womb is very striking and this similitude it is that has induced many to assert that all animals are produced from eggs in the same manner they consider an egg excluded from the body by some and separated into the womb by others to be actions merely of one kind with this only difference that the nourishment of the one is kept within the body of the parent and increases as the embryo happens to want the supply the nourishment of the other is prepared all at once and sent out with the beginning animal as entirely sufficient for its future support but leaving this to the discussion of anatomists let us proceed rather with facts than dissertations and as we have seen the progress of an oviparous animal or one produced from the shell let us likewise trace that of a viviparous animal which is brought forth alive in this investigation graaf has with a degree of patience characteristic of his nation attended the progress and increase of various animals in the womb and minutely marked the changes they undergo having dissected a rabbit half an hour after impregnation he perceived the horns of the womb that go to embrace and communicate with the ovary to be more red than before but no other change in the rest of the parts having dissected another six hours after he perceived the follicules or the membrane covering the eggs contained in the ovary to become reddish in a rabbit dissected after twentyfour hours he perceived in one of the ovaries three follicules and in the other five that were changed being become from transparent dark and reddish in one dissected after three days he perceived the horns of the womb very strictly to embrace the ovaries and he observed three of the follicules in one of them much longer and harder than before pursuing his inquisition he also found two of the eggs actually separated into the horns of the womb and each about the size of a grain of mustard seed these little eggs were each of them enclosed in a double membrane the inner parts being filled with a very limpid liquor after four days he found in one of the ovaries four and in the other five follicules emptied of their eggs and in the horns correspondent to these he found an equal number of eggs thus separated these eggs were now grown larger than before and somewhat of the size of sparrowshot in five days the eggs were grown to the size of duckshot and could be blown from the part of the womb where they were by the breath in seven days these eggs were found of the size of a pistolbullet each covered with its double membrane and these much more distinct than before in nine days having examined the liquor contained in one of these eggs he found it from a limpid color less fluid to have got a light cloud floating upon it in ten days this cloud began to thicken and to form an oblong body of the figure of a little worm and in twelve days the figure of the embryo was distinctly to be perceived and even its parts came into view in the region of the breast he perceived two bloody specks and two more that appeared whitish fourteen days after impregnation the head of the embryo was become large and transparent the eyes prominent the mouth open and the rudiments of the ears beginning to appear the backbone of a whitish color was bent toward the breast the two bloody specks being now considerably increased appeared to be nothing less than the outlines of the two ventricles of the heart and the two whitish specks on each side now appeared to be the rudiments of the lungs toward the region of the belly the liver began to be seen of a reddish color and a little intricate mass like ravelled thread discerned which soon appeared to be the stomach and the intestines the legs soon after began to be seen and to assume their natural positions and from that time forth all the parts being formed every day only served to develope them still more until the thirtyfirst day when the rabbit brought forth her young completely fitted for the purposes of their humble happiness  having thus seen the stages of generation in the meaner animals let us take a view of its progress in man and trace the feeble beginnings of our own existence an account of the lowliness of our own origin if it cannot amuse will at least serve to humble us and it may take from our pride though it fails to gratify our curiosity we cannot here trace the variations of the beginning animal as in the former instances for the opportunities of inspection are but few and accidental for this reason we must be content often to fill up the blanks of our history with conjecture and first we are entirely ignorant of the state of the infant in the womb immediately after conception but we have good reason to believe that it proceeds as in most other animals from the egg this history of the child in the womb is translated from mr buffon with some alterations  anatomists inform us that four days after conception there is found in the womb an oval substance about the size of a small pea but longer one way than the other this little body is formed by an extremely fine membrane enclosing a liquor a good deal resembling the white of an egg in this may even then be perceived several small fibers united together which form the first rudiments of the embryo beside these are seen another set of fibers which soon after become the placenta or that body by which the animal is supplied with nourishment  seven days after conception we can readily distinguish by the eye the first lineaments of the child in the womb however they are as yet without form showing at the end of seven days pretty much such an appearance as that of the chicken after four and twenty hours being a small jellylike mass yet exhibiting the rudiments of the head the trunk is barely visible there likewise is to be discerned a small assemblage of fibers issuing from the body of the infant which afterward become the blood vessels that convey nourishment from the placenta to the child while enclosed in the womb  fifteen days after conception the head becomes distinctly visible and even the most prominent features of the visage begin to appear the nose is a little elevated there are two black specks in the place of eyes and two little holes where the ears are afterward seen the body of the embryo also is grown larger and both above and below are seen two little protuberances which mark the places from whence the arms and thighs are to proceed the length of the whole body at this time is less than half an inch  at the end of three weeks the body has received very little increase but the legs and feet with the hands and arms are become apparent the growth of the arms is more speedy than that of the legs and the fingers are sooner separated than the toes about this time the internal parts are found upon dissection to become distinguishable the places of the bones are marked by small threadlike substances that are yet more fluid even than a jelly among them the ribs are distinguishable like threads also disposed on each side of the spine and even the fingers and toes scarce exceed hairs in thickness  in a month the embryo is an inch long the body is bent forward a situation which it almost always assumes in the womb either because a posture of this kind is the most easy or because it takes up the least room the human figure is now no longer doubtful every part of the face is distinguishable the body is sketched out the bowels are to be distinguished as threads the bones are still quite soft but in some places beginning to assume a greater rigidity the blood vessels that go to the placenta which as was said contributes to the childs nourishment are plainly seen issuing from the navel being therefore called the umbilical vessels and going to spread themselves upon the placenta according to hippocrates the male embryo developes sooner than the female he adds that at the end of thirty days the parts of the body of the male are distinguishable while those of the female are not equally so till ten days after  in six weeks the embryo is grown two inches long the human figure begins to grow every day more perfect the head being still much larger in proportion to the rest of the body and the motion of the heart is perceived almost by the eye it has been seen to beat in an embryo of fifty days old a long time after it had been taken out of the womb  in two months the embryo is more than two inches in length the ossification is perceivable in the arms and thighs and in the point of the chin the under jaw being greatly advanced before the upper these parts however may as yet be considered as bony points rather than as bones the umbilical vessels which before went side by side are now begun to be twisted like a rope one over the other and go to join with the placenta which as yet is but small  in three months the embryo is above three inches long and weighs about three ounces hippocrates observes that not till then the mother perceives the childs motion and he adds that in female children the motion is not observable till the end of four months however this is no general rule as there are women who assert that they perceived themselves to be quick with child as their expression is at the end of two months so that this quickness seems rather to arise from the proportion between the childs strength and the mothers sensibility than from any determinate period of time at all times however the child is equally alive and consequently those juries of matrons that are to determine upon the pregnancy of criminals should not enquire whether the woman be quick but whether she be with child if the latter be perceivable the former follows of course  four months and an half after conception the embryo is from six to seven inches long all the parts are so augmented that even their proportions are now distinguishable the very nails begin to appear upon the fingers and toes and the stomach and intestines already begin to perform their functions of receiving and digesting in the stomach is found a liquor similar to that in which the embryo floats in one part of the intestines a milky substance and in the other an excrementitious there is found also a small quantity of bile in the gallbladder and some urine in its own proper receptacle by this time also the posture of the embryo seems to be determined the head is bent forward so that the chin seems to rest upon its breast the knees are raised up toward the head and the legs bent backward somewhat resembling the posture of those who sit on their haunches sometimes the knees are raised so high as to touch the cheeks and the feet are crossed over each other the arms are laid upon the breast while one of the hands and often both touch the visage sometimes the hands are shut and sometimes also the arms are found hanging down by the body these are the most usual postures which the embryo assumes but these it is frequently known to change and it is owing to these alterations that the mother so frequently feels those twitches which are usually attended with pain  the embryo thus situated is furnished by nature with all things proper for its support and as it increases in size its nourishment also is found to increase with it as soon as it first begins to grow in the womb that receptacle from being very small grows larger and what is more surprising thicker every day the sides of a bladder as we know the more they are distended the more they become thin but here the larger the womb grows the more it appears to thicken within this the embryo is still farther involved in two membranes called the chorion and amnios and floats in a thin transparent fluid upon which it seems in some measure to subsist however the great storehouse from whence its chief nourishment is supplied is called the placenta a red substance somewhat resembling a sponge that adheres to the inside of the womb and communicates by the umbilical vessels with the embryo these umbilical vessels which consist of a vein and two arteries issue from the navel of the child and are branched out upon the placenta where they in fact seem to form its substance and if i may so express it to suck up their nourishment from the womb and the fluids contained therein the blood thus received from the womb by the placenta and communicated by the umbilical vein to the body of the embryo is conveyed to the heart where without ever passing into the lungs as in the born infant it takes a shorter course for entering the right auricle of the heart instead of passing up into the pulmonary artery it seems to break this partition and goes directly through the body of the heart by an opening called the foramen ovale and from thence to the aorta or great artery by which it is driven into all parts of the body thus we see the placenta in some measure supplying the place of lungs for as the little animal can receive no air by inspiration the lungs are therefore useless but we see the placenta converting the fluid of the womb into blood and sending it by the umbilical vein to the heart from whence it is dispatched by a quicker and shorter circulation through the whole frame  in this manner the embryo reposes in the womb supplied with that nourishment which is fitted to its necessities and furnished with those organs that are adapted to its situation as its sensations are but few its wants are in the same proportion and it is probable that a sleep with scarce any intervals marks the earliest period of animal life as the little creature however gathers strength and size it seems to become more wakeful and uneasy even in the womb it begins to feel the want of something that it does not possess a sensation that seems coeval with mans nature and never leaves him till he dies the embryo even then begins to struggle for a state more marked by pleasure and pain and from about the sixth month begins to give the mother warning of the greater pain she is yet to endure the continuation of pregnancy in woman is usually nine months but there have been many instances when the child has lived that was born at seven and some also are found to continue pregnant a month above the usual time when the appointed time approaches the infant that has for some months been giving painful proofs of its existence now begins to increase its efforts for liberty the head is applied downward to the apperture of the womb and by reiterated efforts it endeavors to extend the same these endeavors produce the pain which all women in labor feel in some degree those of strong constitutions the least those most weakly the most severely since we learn that the women of africa always deliver themselves and are well a few hours after while those of europe require assistance and recover more slowly thus the infant still continuing to push with its head forward by the repetition of its endeavors at last succeeds and issues into life the blood which had hitherto passed through the heart now takes a wider circuit and the foramen ovale closes the lungs that had till this time been inactive now first begin their functions the air rushes in to distend them and this produces the first sensation of pain which the infant expresses by a shriek so that the beginning of our lives as well as the end is marked with anguish bonet contemplat de la nature vol i p       from comparing these accounts we perceive that the most labored generation is the most perfect and that the animal which in proportion to its bulk takes the longest time for production is always the most complete when finished of all others man seems the slowest in coming into life as he is the slowest in coming to perfection other animals of the same bulk seldom remain in the womb above six months while he continues nine and even after his birth appears more than any other to have his state of imbecility prolonged  we may observe also that that generation is the most complete in which the fewest animals are produced nature by attending to the production of one at a time seems to exert all her efforts in bringing it to perfection but where this attention is divided the animals so produced come into the world with partial advantages in this manner twins are never at least while infants so large or so strong as those that come singly into the world each having in some measure robbed the other of its right as that support which nature meant for one has been prodigally divided  in this manner as those animals are the best that are produced singly so we find that the noblest animals are ever the least fruitful these are seen usually to bring forth but one at a time and to place all their attention upon that alone on the other hand all the oviparous kinds produce in amazing plenty and even the lower tribes of viviparous animals increase in a seeming proportion to their minuteness and imperfection nature seems lavish of life in the lower orders of the creation and as if she meant them entirely for the use of the nobler races she appears to have bestowed greater pains in multiplying the number than in completing the kind in this manner while the elephant and the horse bring forth but one at a time the spider and the beetle are seen to produce a thousand and even among the smaller quadrupedes themselves all the inferior kinds are extremely fertile any one of these being found in a very few months to become the parent of a numerous progeny  in this manner therefore the smallest animals multiply in the greatest proportion and we have reason to thank providence that the most formidable animals are the least fruitful had the lion and the tiger the same degree of fecundity with the rabbit or the rat all the arts of man would be unable to oppose these fierce invaders and we should soon perceive them become the tyrants of those who claim the lordship of the creation but heaven in this respect has wisely consulted the advantage of all it has opposed to man only such enemies as he has art and strength to conquer and as large animals require proportional supplies nature was unwilling to give new life where it in some measure denied the necessary means of subsistence  in consequence of this preestablished order the animals that are endowed with the most perfect methods of generation and bring forth but one at a time seldom begin to procreate till they have almost acquired their full growth on the other hand those which bring forth many engender before they have arrived at half their natural size the horse and the bull come almost to perfection before they begin to generate the hog and the rabbit scarce leave the tate before they become parents themselves in whatever light therefore we consider this subject we shall find that all creatures approach most to perfection whose generation most nearly resembles that of man the reptile produced from cutting is but one degree above the vegetable the animal produced from the egg is still a step higher in the scale of existence that class of animals which are brought forth alive are still more exalted of these such as bring forth one at a time are the most complete and foremost of these stands man the great master of all who seems to have united the perfections of all the rest in his formation  chap ii the infancy of man when we take a survey of the various classes of animals and examine their strength their beauty or their structure we shall find man to possess most of those advantages united which the rest enjoy partially infinitely superior to all others in the powers of the understanding he is also superior to them in the fitness and proportions of his form he would indeed have been one of the most miserable beings upon earth if with a sentient mind he was so formed as to be incapable of obeying its impulse but nature has otherwise provided as with the most extensive intellects to command she has furnished him with a body the best fitted for obedience  in infancy buffon vol iv p      however that mind and this body form the most helpless union in all animated nature and if any thing can give us a picture of complete imbecility it is a man when just come into the world the infant just born stands in need of all things without the power of procuring any the lower races of animals upon being produced are active vigorous and capable of selfsupport but the infant is obliged to wait in helpless expectation and its cries are its only aid to procure subsistence  an infant just born may be said to come from one element into another for from the watery fluid in which it was surrounded it now immerges into air and its first cries seem to imply how greatly it regrets the change how much longer it could have continued in a state of almost total insensibility in the womb is impossible to tell but it is very probable that it could remain there some hours more in order to throw some light upon this subject mr buffon so placed a pregnant bitch as that her puppies were brought forth in warm water in which he kept them above half an hour at a time however he saw no change in the animals thus newly brought forth they continued the whole time vigorous and during the whole time it is very probable that the blood circulated through the same channels through which it passed while they continued in the womb  almost all animals have their eyes closed buffon ibid  for some days after being brought into the world the infant opens them the instant of its birth however it seems to keep them fixed and idle they want that luster which they acquire by degrees and if they happen to move is is rather an accidental gaze than an exertion of the act of seeing the light alone seems to make the greatest impression upon them the eyes of infants are sometimes found turned to the place where it is strongest and the pupil is seen to dilate and diminish as in grown persons in proportion to the quantity it receives but still the infant is incapable of distinguishing objects the sense of seeing like the rest of the senses requires an habit before it becomes any way serviceable all the senses must be compared with each other and must be made to correct the defects of one another before they can give just information it is probable therefore that if the infant could express its own sensations it would give a very extraordinary description of the illusions which it suffers from them the sight might perhaps be represented as inverting objects or multiplying them the hearing instead of conveying one uniform tone might be said to bring up an interrupted succession of noises and the touch apparently would divide one body into as many as there are fingers that grasped it but all these errors are lost in one common confused idea of existence and it is happy for the infant that it then can make but very little use of its senses when they could serve only to bring it false information  if there be any distinct sensations those of pain seem to be much more frequent and stronger than those of pleasure the infants cries are sufficient indications of the uneasinesses it must at every interval endure while in the beginning it has got no external marks to testify its satisfactions it is not till after forty days that it is seen to smile and not till that time also the tears begin to appear its former expressions of uneasiness being always without them as to any other marks of the passions the infant being as yet almost without them it can express none of them in its visage which except in the act of crying and laughing is fixed in a settled serenity all the other parts of the body seem equally relaxed and feeble its motions are uncertain and its postures without choice it is unable to stand upright its hams are yet bent from the habit which it received from its position in the womb it has not strength enough in its arms to stretch them forward much less to grasp any thing with its hands it rests just in the posture it is laid and if abandoned must still continue in the same position  nevertheless though this be the description of infancy among mankind in general there are countries and races among whom infancy does not seem marked with such utter imbecility but where the children not long after they are born appear possessed of a greater share of selfsupport the children of negroes have a surprising degree of this premature industry they are able to walk at two months or at least to move from one place to another they also hang to the mothers back without any assistance and seize the breast over her shoulder continuing in this posture till she thinks proper to lay them down this is very different in the children of our countries that seldom are able to walk under a twelvemonth  the skin of children newly brought forth is always red proceeding from its transparency by which the blood beneath appears more conspicuous some say that this redness is greatest in those children that are afterward about to have the finest complexions and it stands to reason that it should be so since the thinnest skins are always the fairest the size of a newborn infant is generally about twenty inches and its weight about twelve pounds the head is large and all the members delicate soft and puffy these appearances alter with its age as it grows older the head becomes less in proportion to the rest of the body the flesh hardens the bones that before birth grew very thick in proportion now lengthen by degrees and the human figure more and more acquires its due dimensions in such children however as are but feeble or sickly the head always continues too big for the body the heads of dwarfs being extremely large in proportion  infants when newly born pass most of their time in sleeping and awake with crying excited either by sensations of pain or of hunger man when come to maturity but rarely feels the want of food as eating twice or thrice in the four and twenty hours is known to suffice the most voracious but the infant may be considered as a little glutton whose only pleasure consists in its appetite and this except when it sleeps it is never easy without satisfying thus nature has adapted different desires to the different periods of life each as it seems most necessary for human support or succession while the animal is yet forming hunger excites it to that supply which is necessary for its growth when it is completely formed a different appetite takes place that incites it to communicate existence these two desires take up the whole attention at different periods but are very seldom found to prevail strongly together in the same age one pleasure ever serving to repress the other and if we find a person of full age placing a principal part of his happiness in the nature and quantity of his food we have strong reasons to suspect that with respect to his other appetites he still retains a part of the imbecility of his childhood  it is extraordinary enough however that infants who are thus more voracious than grown persons are nevertheless more capable of sustaining hunger we have several instances in accidental cases of famine in which the child has been known to survive the parent and they have been seen clinging to the breast of their dead mother their little bodies also are more patient of cold and we have similar instances of the mothers perishing in the snow while the infant has been found alive beside her however if we examine the internal structure of infants we shall find an obvious reason for both these advantages their blood vessels are known to be much larger than in adults and their nerves much thicker and softer thus being furnished with a more copious quantity of juices both of the nervous and sanguinary kinds the infant finds a temporary sustenance in this superfluity and does not expire till both are exhausted the circulation also being larger and quicker supplies it with proportionable warmth so that it is more capable of resisting the accidental rigours of the weather  the first nourishment of infants is well known to be the mothers milk and what is remarkable the infant itself has milk in its own breasts which may be squeezed out by compression this nourishment becomes less grateful as the child gathers strength and perhaps also more unwholesome however in cold countries which are unfavourable to propagation and where the female has seldom above three or four children at the most during her life she continues to suckle the child for four or five years together in this manner the mothers of canada and greenland are often seen suckling two or three children of different ages at a time  the life of infants is very precarious till the age of three or four from which time it becomes more secure and when a child arrives at its seventh year it is then considered as a more certain life as mr buffon asserts than at any other age whatever it appears from simpsons tables that of a certain number of children born at the same time a fourth part are found dead at the end of the first year more than two thirds at the end of the second and at least half at the end of the third so that those who live to be above three years old are indulged a longer term than half the rest of their fellow creatures nevertheless life at that period may be considered as mere animal existence and rather a preparation for than an enjoyment of those satisfactions both of mind and body that make life of real value and hence it is more natural for mankind to deplore a fellow creature cut off in the bloom of life than one dying in early infancy the one by living up to youth and thus wading through the disadvantageous parts of existence seems to have earned a short continuance of its enjoyments the infant on the contrary has served but a short apprenticeship to pain and when taken away may be considered as rescued from a long continuance of misery  there is something very remarkable in the growth of the human body buffon vol iv p      the embryo in the womb continues to increase still more and more till it is born on the other hand the childs growth is less every year till the time of puberty when it seems to start up of a sudden thus for instance the embryo which is an inch long in the first month grows but one inch and a quarter in the second it then grows one and an half in the third two and an half in the fourth and in this manner it keeps increasing till in the last month of its continuance it is actually found to grow four inches and in the whole about eighteen inches long but it is otherwise with the child when born if we suppose it eighteen inches at that time it grows in the first year six or seven inches in the second year it grows but four inches in the third year about three and so on at the rate of about an inch and an half or two inches each year till the time of puberty when nature seems to make one great last effort to complete her work and unfold the whole animal machine  the growth of the mind in children seems to correspond with that of the body the comparative progress of the understanding is greater in infants than in children of three or four years old if we only reflect a moment on the amazing acquisitions that an infant makes in the first and second years of life we shall have much cause for wonder being sent into a world where every thing is new and unknown the first months of life are spent in a kind of torpid amazement an attention distracted by the multiplicity of objects that press to be known the first labor therefore of the little learner is to correct the illusions of the senses to distinguish one object from another and to exert the memory so as to know them again in this manner a child of a year old has already made a thousand experiments all which it has properly ranged and distinctly remembers light heat fire sweets and bitters sounds soft or terrible are all distinguished at the end of a very few months besides this every person the child knows every individual object it becomes fond of its rattles or its bells may be all considered as so many new lessons to the young mind with which it has not become acquainted without repeated exertions of the understanding at this period of life the knowledge of every individual object cannot be acquired without the same effort which when grown up is employed upon the most abstract idea every thing the child hears or sees all the marks and characters of nature are as much unknown and require the same attention to attain as if the reader were set to understand the characters of an ethiopic manuscript and yet we see in how short a time the little student begins to understand them all and to give evident marks of early industry  it is very amusing to pursue the young mind while employed in its first seize at about a year old the same necessities that first engaged its faculties increase as its acquaintance with nature enlarges its studies therefore if i may use the expression are no way relaxed for having experienced what gave pleasure at one time it desires a repetition of it from the same object and in order to obtain this that object must be pointed out here therefore a new necessity arises which very often neither its little arts nor importunities can remove so that the child is at last obliged to set about naming the objects it desires to possess or avoid in beginning to speak which is usually about a year old children find a thousand difficulties it is not without repeated trials that they come to pronounce any one of the letters nor without an effort of the memory that they can retain them for this reason we frequently see them attempting a sound which they had learned but forgot and when they have failed i have often seen their attempt attended with apparent confusion the letters soonest learned are those which are most easily formed thus a and b require an obvious disposition of the organs and their pronunciation is consequently soon attained z and r which require a more complicated position are learned with greater difficulty and this may perhaps be the reason why the children in some countries speak sooner than in others for the letters mostly occurring in the language of one country being such as are of easy pronunciation that language is of course more easily attained in this manner the children of the italians are said to speak sooner than those of the germans the language of the one being smooth and open that of the other crowded with consonants and extremely gutteral  but be this as it will in all countries children are found able to express the greatest part of their wants by the time they arrive at two years old and from the moment the necessity of learning new words ceases they relax their industry it is then that the mind like the body seems every year to make slow advances and in order to spur up attention many systems of education have been contrived  almost every philosopher who has written on the education of children has been willing to point out a method of his own chiefly professing to advance the health and improve the intellects at the same time these are usually found to begin with finding nothing right in the common practice and by urging a total reformation in consequence of this nothing can be more wild or imaginary than their various systems of improvement some will have the children every day plunged in cold water in order to strengthen their bodies they will have them converse with the servants in nothing but the latin language in order to strengthen their minds every hour of the day must be appointed for its own studies and the child must learn to make these very studies an amusement till about the age of ten or eleven it becomes a prodigy of premature improvement quite opposite to this we have others whom the courtesy of mankind also calls philosophers and they will have the child learn nothing till the age of ten or eleven at which the former has attained so much perfection with them the mind is to be kept empty until it has a proper distinction of some metaphysical ideas about truth and the promising pupil is debarred the use of even his own faculties lest they should conduct him into prejudice and error in this manner some men whom fashion has celebrated for profound and fine thinkers have given their hazarded and untried conjectures upon one of the most important subjects in the world and the most interesting to humanity when men speculate at liberty upon innate ideas or the abstracted distinctions between will and power they may be permitted to enjoy their systems at pleasure as they are harmless although they may be wrong but when they allege that children are to be every day plunged in cold water and whatever be their constitution indiscriminately enured to cold and moisture that they are to be kept wet in the feet to prevent their catching cold and never to be corrected when young for fear of breaking their spirits when old these are such noxious errors that all reasonable men should endeavor to oppose them many have been the children whom these opinions begun in speculation have injured or destroyed in practice and i have myself seen many a little philosophical martyr whom i wished but was unable to relieve  if any system be now therefore necessary it is one that would serve to show a very plain point that very little system is necessary the natural and common course of education is in every respect the best i mean that in which the child is permitted to play among its little equals from whose similar instructions it often gains the most useful stores of knowledge a child is not idle because it is playing about the fields or pursuing a butterfly it is all this time storing its mind with objects upon the nature the properties and the relations of which future curiosity may speculate  i have ever found it a vain task to try to make a childs learning its amusement nor do i see what good end it would answer were it actually attained the child as was said ought to have its share of play and it will be benefited thereby and for every reason also it ought to have its share of labor the mind by early labor will be thus accustomed to fatigues and subordination and whatever be the persons future employment in life he will be better fitted to endure it he will be thus enabled to support the drudgeries of office with content or to fill up the vacancies of life with variety the child therefore should by times be put to its duty and be taught to know that the task is to be done or the punishment to be endured i do not object against alluring it to duty by reward but we well know that the mind will be more strongly stimulated by pain and both may upon some occasions take their turn to operate in this manner a child by playing with its equals abroad and laboring with them at school will acquire more health and knowledge than by being bred up under the wing of any speculative systemmaker and will be thus qualified for a life of activity and obedience it is true indeed that when educated in this manner the boy may not be so seemingly sensible and forward as one bred up under solitary instruction and perhaps this early forwardness is more engaging than useful it is well known that many of those children who have been such prodigies of literature before ten have not made an adequate progress to twenty it should seem that they only began learning manly things before their time and while others were busied in picking up that knowledge adapted to their age and curiosity these were forced upon subjects unsuited to their years and upon that account alone appearing extraordinary the stock of knowledge in both may be equal but with this difference that each is yet to learn what the other knows  but whatever may have been the acquisitions of children at ten or twelve their greatest and most rapid progress is made when they arrive near the age of puberty it is then that all the powers of nature seem at work in strengthening the mind and completing the body the youth acquires courage and the virgin modesty the mind with new sensations assumes new powers it conceives with greater force and remembers with greater tenacity about this time therefore which is various in different countries more is learned in one year than in any two of the preceding and on this age in particular the greatest weight of instruction ought to be thrown  chap iv of puberty it has been often said that the season of youth is the season of pleasures but this can only be true in savage countries where but little preparation is made for the perfection of human nature and where the mind has but a very small part in the enjoyment it is otherwise in those places where nature is carried to the highest pitch of refinement in which this season of the greatest sensual delight is wisely made subservient to the succeeding and more rational one of manhood youth with us is but a scene of preparation a drama upon the right conduct of which all future happiness is to depend the youth who follows his appetites too soon seizes the cup before it has received its best ingredients and by anticipating his pleasures robs the remaining parts of life of their share so that his eagerness only produces a manhood of imbecility and an age of pain  the time of puberty is different in various countries and always more late in men than in women in the warm countries of india the women are marriageable at nine or ten and the men at twelve or thirteen it is also different in cities where the inhabitants lead a more soft luxurious life from the country where they work harder and fare less delicately its symptoms are seldom alike in different persons but it is usually known by a welling of the breasts in one sex and a roughness of the voice in the other at this season also the women seem to acquire new beauty while the men lose all that delicate effeminacy of countenance which they had when boys  all countries in proportion as they are civilized or barbarous improve or degrade the nuptial satisfaction in those miserable regions where strength makes the only law the stronger sex exerts its power and becomes the tyrant over the weaker while the inhabitant of negroland is indolently taking his pleasure in the fields his wife is obliged to till the grounds that serve for their mutual support it is thus in all barbarous countries where the men throw all the laborious duties of life upon the women and regardless of beauty put the softer sex to those employments that must effectually destroy it  but in countries that are half barbarous particularly wherever mahometanism prevails the men run into the very opposite extreme equally brutal with the former they exert their tyranny over the weaker sex and consider that half of the human creation as merely made to be subservient to the depraved desires of the other the chief and indeed the only aim of an asiatic is to be possessed of many women and to be able to furnish a seraglio is the only tendency of his ambition as the savage was totally regardless of beauty he on the contrary prizes it too highly he excludes the person who is possessed of such personal attractions from any share in the duties or employments of life and as if willing to engross all beauty to himself increases the number of his captives in proportion to the progress of his fortune in this manner he vainly expects to augment his satisfactions by seeking from many that happiness which he ought to look for in the society of one alone he lives a gloomy tyrant amidst wretches of his own making he feels none of those endearments which spring from affection none of those delicacies which arise from knowledge his mistresses being shut out from the world and totally ignorant of all that passes there have no arts to entertain his mind or calm his anxieties the day passes with them in sullen silence or languid repose appetite can furnish but few opportunities of varying the scene and all that falls beyond it must be irksome expectation  from this avarice of women if i may be allowed to express it so has proceeded that jealousy and suspicion which ever attends the miser hence those low and barbarous methods of keeping the women of those countries guarded and of making and procuring eunuchs to attend them these unhappy creatures are of two kinds the white and the black the white are generally made in the country where they reside being but partly deprived of the marks of virility the black are generally brought from the interior parts of africa and are made entirely bare these are chiefly chosen for their deformity the thicker the lips the flatter the nose and the more black the teeth the more valuable the eunuch so that the vile jealousy of mankind here inverts the order of nature and the poor wretch finds himself valued in proportion to his deficiencies in italy where this barbarous custom is still retained and eunuchs are made in order to improve the voice the laws are severely aimed against such practice so that being entirely prohibited none but the poorest and most abandoned of the people still secretly practice it upon their children of those served in this manner not one in ten is found to become a singer but such is the luxurious folly of the times that the success of one amply compensates for the failure of the rest it is very difficult to account for the alterations which castration makes in the voice and the other parts of the body the eunuch is shaped differently from others his legs are of an equal thickness above and below his knees weak his shoulders narrow and his beard thin and downy in this manner his person is rendered more deformed but his desires as i am told still continue the same and actually in asia some of them are found to have their seraglios as well as their masters even in our country we have an instance of a very fine womans being married to one of them whose appearance was the most unpromising and what is more extraordinary still i am told that this couple continue perfectly happy in each others society  the mere necessities of life seem the only aim of the savage the sensual pleasures are the only study of the semibarbarian but the refinement of sensuality by reason is the boast of real politeness among the merely barbarous nations such as the natives of madagascar or the inhabitants of congo nothing is desired so ardently as to prostitute their wives or daughters to strangers for the most trifling advantages they will account it a dishonor not to be among the foremost who are thus received into favor on the other hand the mohammedan keeps his wife faithful by confining her person and would instantly put her to death if he but suspected her chastity with the politer inhabitants of europe both these barbarous extremes are avoided the womans person is left free and no constraint is imposed but upon her affections the passion of love which may be considered as the nice conduct of ruder desire is only known and practiced in this part of the world so that what other nations guard as their right the more delicate european is contented to ask as a favor in this manner the concurrence of mutual appetite contributes to increase mutual satisfaction and the power on one side of refusing makes every blessing more grateful when obtained by the other in barbarous countries woman is considered merely as an useful slave in such as are somewhat more refined she is regarded as a desirable toy in countries entirely polished she enjoys juster privileges the wife being considered as an useful friend and an agreeable mistress her mind is still more prized than her person and without the improvement of both she can never expect to become truly agreeable for her good sense alone can preserve what she has gained by her beauty  female beauty as was said is always seen to improve about the age of puberty but if we should attempt to define in what this beauty consists or what constitutes its perfection we should find nothing more difficult to determine every country has its peculiar way of thinking in this respect and even the same country thinks differently at different times the ancients had a very different taste from what prevails at present the eyebrows joining in the middle was considered as a very peculiar grace by tibullus in the enumeration of the charms of his mistress narrow foreheads were approved of and scarce any of the roman ladies that are celebrated for their other perfections but are also praised for the redness of their hair the nose also of the grecian venus was such as would appear at present an actual deformity as it fell in a straight line from the forehead without the smallest sinking between the eyes without which we never see a face at present  among the moderns every country seems to have peculiar ideas of beauty mr buffon  the persians admire large eyebrows joining in the middle the edges and corners of the eyes are tinctured with black and the size of the head is increased by a great variety of bandages formed into a turban in some parts of india black teeth and white hair are desired with ardour and one of the principal employments of the women of thibet is to redden the teeth with herbs and to make their hair white by a certain preparation the passion for colored teeth obtains also in china and japan where to complete their idea of beauty the object of desire must have little eyes nearly closed feet extremely small and a waist far from being shapely there are some nations of the american indians that flatten the heads of their children by keeping them while young squeezed between two boards so as to make the visage much larger than it would naturally be others flatten the head at top and others still make it as round as they possibly can the inhabitants along the western coasts of africa have a very extraordinary taste for beauty a flat nose thick lips and a jet black complexion are there the most indulgent gifts of nature such indeed they are all in some degree found to possess however they take care by art to increase these natural deformities as they should seem to us and they have many additional methods of rendering their persons still more frightfully pleasing the whole body and visage is often scarred with a variety of monstrous figures which is not done without great pain and repeated incision and even sometimes parts of the body are cut away but it would be endless to remark the various arts which caprice or custom has employed to distort and disfigure the body in order to render it more pleasing in fact every nation how barbarous soever seems unsatisfied with the human figure as nature has left it and has its peculiar arts of heightening beauty painting powdering cutting boring the nose and the ears lengthening the one and depressing the other are arts practiced in many countries and in some degree admired in all these arts might have been at first introduced to hide epidemic deformities custom by degrees reconciles them to the view till from looking upon them with indifference the eye at length begins to gaze with pleasure  chap v of the age of manhood this chapter is translated from mr buffon whose description is very excellent whatever i have added is marked by inverted commas thus and in whatever trifling points i have differed the notes will serve to show  the human body attains to its full height during the age of puberty or at least a short time after some young people are found to cease growing at fourteen or fifteen others continue their growth till two or three and twenty during this period they are all of a slender make their thighs and legs small and the muscular parts as yet unfilled but by degrees the fleshy fibers augment the muscles swell and assume their figure the limbs become proportioned and rounder and before the age of thirty the body in men has acquired the most perfect symmetry in women the body arrives at perfection much sooner as they arrive at the age of maturity more early the muscles and all the other parts being weaker less compact and solid than those of man they require less time in coming to perfection and as they are less in size that size is sooner completed hence the persons of women are found to be as complete at twenty as those of men are found to be at thirty  the body of a wellshaped man ought to be square the muscles should be expressed with boldness and the lines of the face strongly marked in the woman all the colors should be rounder the lines softer and the features more delicate strength and majesty belong to the man grace and softness are the peculiar embellishments of the other sex in both every part of their form declares their sovereignty over other creatures man supports his body erect his attitude is that of command and his face which is turned toward the heavens displays the dignity of his station the image of his soul is painted in his visage and the excellence of his nature penetrates through the material form in which it is enclosed his majestic port his sedate and resolute step announce the nobleness of his rank he touches the earth only with his extremity and beholds it as if at a disdainful distance his arms are not given him as to other creatures for pillars of support nor does he lose by rendering them callous against the ground that delicacy of touch which furnishes him with so many of his enjoyments his hands are made for very different purposes to second every intention of his will and to perfect the gifts of nature  when the soul is at rest all the features of the visage seem settled in a state of profound tranquillity their proportion their union and their harmony seem to mark the sweet serenity of the mind and give a true information of what passes within but when the soul is excited the human visage becomes a living picture where the passions are expressed with as much delicacy as energy where every motion is designed by some correspondent feature where every impression anticipates the will and betrays those hidden agitations that he would often wish to conceal  it is particularly in the eyes that the passions are painted and in which we may most readily discover their beginning the eye seems to belong to the soul more than any other organ it seems to participate of all its emotions as well the most soft and tender as the most tumultuous and forceful it not only receives but transmits them by sympathy the observing eye of one catches the secret fire from another and the passion thus often becomes general  such persons as are short sighted labor under a particular disadvantage in this respect they are in a manner entirely cut off from the language of the eyes and this gives an air of stupidity to the face which often produces very unfavourable preventions however intelligent we find such persons to be we can scarcely be brought back from our first prejudice and often continue in the first erroneous opinion in this manner we are too much induced to judge of men by their physiognomy and having perhaps at first caught up our judgments prematurely they mechanically influence us all our lives after this extends even to the very color or the cut of peoples clothes and we should for this reason be careful even in such trifling particulars since they go to make up a part of the total judgment which those we converse with may form to our advantage  the vivacity or the languid motion of the eyes gives the strongest marks to physiognomy and their color contributes still more to enforce the expression the different colors of the eye are the dark hazle the light hazle the green the blue the gray the whitish gray and also the red these different colors arise from the different colors of the little muscles that serve to contract the pupil and they are very often found to change color with disorder and with age  the most ordinary colors are the hazle and the blue and very often both these colors are found in the eyes of the same person those eyes which are called black are only of the dark hazle which may be easily seen upon closer inspection however those eyes are reckoned the most beautiful where the shade is the deepest and either in these or the blue eyes the fire which gives its finest expression to the eye is more distinguishable in proportion to the darkness of the tint for this reason the black eyes as they are called have the greatest vivacity but probably the blue have the most powerful effect in beauty as they reflect a greater variety of lights being composed of more various colors  this variety which is found in the color of the eyes is peculiar to man and one or two other kinds of animals but in general the color in any one individual is the same in all the rest the eyes of oxen are brown those of sheep of a water color those of goats are gray and it may also be in general remarked that the eyes of most white animals are red thus the rabbit the ferrit and even in the human race the white moor all have their eyes of a red color  although the eye when put into motion seems to be drawn on one side yet it only moves round its center by which its colored part moves nearer or farther from the angle of the eyelids or is elevated or deprest the distance between the eyes is less in man than in any other animal and in some of them it is so great that it is impossible that they should ever view the same object with both eyes at once unless it be very far off this however in them is rather an advantage than an inconvenience as they are thus able to watch round them and guard against the dangers of their precarious situation  next to the eyes the features which most give a character to the face are the eyebrows which being in some measure more apparent than the other features are most readily distinguished at a distance le brun in giving a painter directions with regard to the passions places the principal expression of the face in the eye brows from their elevation and depression most of the furious passions are characterized and such as have this feature extremely moveable are usually known to have an expressive face by means of these we can imitate all the other passions as they are raised and depressed at command the rest of the features are generally fixed or when put into motion they do not obey the will the mouth and eyes in an actor for instance may by being violently distorted give a very different expression from what he would intend but the eyebrows can scarcely be exerted improperly their being raised denotes all those passions which pride or pleasure inspire and their depression marks those which are the effects of contemplation and pain and such who have this feature therefore most at command are often found to excel as actors  the eyelashes have an effect in giving expression to the eye particularly when long and close they soften its glances and improve its sweetness man and apes are the only animals that have eyelashes both upon the upper and lower lids all other animals want them on the lid below  the eyelids serve to guard the ball of the eye and to furnish it with a proper moisture the upper lid rises and falls the lower has scarce any motion and although their being moved depends on the will yet it often happens that the will is unable to keep them open when sleep or fatigue oppresses the mind in birds and amphibious quadrupedes the lower lid alone has motion fishes and insects have no eyelids whatsoever  the forehead makes a large part of the face and a part which chiefly contributes to its beauty it ought to be justly proportioned neither too round nor too flat neither too narrow nor too low and the hair should come thick upon its extremities it is known to every body how much the hair tends to improve the face and how much the being bald serves to take away from beauty the highest part of the head is that which becomes bald the soonest as well as that part which lies immediately above the temples the hair under the temples and at the back of the head is very seldom known to fail and women are much less apt to become bald than men mr buffon seems to think they never become bald at all but we have too many instances of the contrary among us not very easily to contradict the assertion of all parts or appendages of the body the hair is that which is found most different in different climates and often not only contributes to mark the country but also the disposition of the man it is in general thickest where the constitution is strongest and more glossy and beautiful where the health is most permanent the ancients held the hair to be a sort of excrement produced like the nails the part next the root pushing out that immediately contiguous but the moderns have found that every hair may be truly said to live to receive nutriment to fill and distend itself like the other parts of the body the roots they observe do not turn gray sooner than the extremities but the whole hair changes color at once and we have many instances of persons who have grown gray in one nights time mr buffon says that the hair begins to grow gray at the points but the fact is otherwise  each hair if viewed with a microscope is found to consist of five or six lesser ones all wrapped up in one common covering it appears knotted like some sorts of grass and sends forth branches at the joints it is bulbous at the root by which it imbibes its moisture from the body and it is split at the points so that a single hair at its end resembles a brush whatever be the size or the shape of the pore through which the hair issues it accommodates itself to the same being either thick as they are large small as they are less round triangular and variously formed as the pores happen to be various the hair takes its color from the juices flowing through it and it is found that this color differs in different tribes and races of people the americans and the asiatics have their hair black thick straight and shining the inhabitants of the torrid climates of africa have it black short and woolly the people of scandinavia have it red long and curled and those of our own and the neighboring countries are found with hair of various colors however it is supposed by many that every man resembles in his disposition the inhabitants of those countries whom he resembles in the color and the nature of his hair so that the black are said like the asiatics to be grave and acute the red like the gothic nations to be choleric and bold however this may be the length and the strength of the hair is a general mark of a good constitution and as that hair which is strongest is most commonly curled so curled hair is generally regarded among us as a beauty the greeks however had a very different idea of beauty in this respect and seem to have taken one of their peculiar national distinctions from the length and the straightness of the hair  the nose is the most prominent feature in the face but as it has scarce any motion and that only in the strongest passions it rather adds to the beauty than to the expression of the countenance however i am told by the skilful in this branch of knowledge that wide nostrils add a great deal to the bold and resolute air of the countenance and where they are narrow though it may constitute beauty it seldom improves expression the form of the nose and its advanced position are peculiar to the human visage alone other animals for the most part have nostrils with a partition between them but none of them have an elevated nose apes themselves have scarce any thing else of this feature but the nostrils the rest of the feature lying flat upon the visage and scarce higher than the cheek bones among all the tribes of savage men also the nose is very flat and i have seen a tartar who had scarce any thing else but two holes through which to breathe  the mouth and lips next to the eyes are found to have the greatest expression the passions have great power over this part of the face and the mouth marks its different degrees by its different forms the organ of speech still more animates this part and gives it more life than any other feature in the countenance the ruby color of the lips and the white enamel of the teeth give it such a superiority over every other feature that it seems to make the principal object of our regards in fact the whole attention is fixed upon the lips of the speaker however rapid his discourse however various the subject the mouth takes correspondent situations and deaf men have been often found to see the force of those reasonings which they could not hear understanding every word as it was spoken  the under jaw in man possesses a great variety of motions while the upper has been thought by many to be quite immovable mr buffon is of this opinion he says that the upper jaw is immovable in all animals whatsoever however the parrot is an obvious exception and so is man himself as shown above  however that it moves in man a very easy experiment will suffice to convince us if we keep the head fixed with any thing between our teeth the edge of a table for instance and then open our mouths we shall find that both jaws recede from it at the same time the upper jaw rises and the lower falls and the table remains untouched between them the upper jaw therefore has motion as well as the under and what is remarkable it has its proper muscles behind the head for thus raising and depressing it whenever therefore we eat both jaws move at the same time though very unequally for the whole head moving with the upper jaw of which it makes a part its motions are thus less observable in the human embryo the under jaw is very much advanced before the upper in the adult it hangs a good deal more backward and those whose upper and under row of teeth are equally prominent and strike directly against each other are what the painters call underhung and they consider this as a great defect in beauty mr buffon says that both jaws in a perfect face should be on a level but this is denied by the best painters  the under jaw in a chinese face falls greatly more backward than with us and i am told the difference is half an inch when the mouth is shut naturally in instances of the most violent passion the under jaw has often an involuntary quivering motion and often also a state of languor produces another which is that of yawning every one knows how very sympathetic this kind of languid motion is and that for one person to yawn is sufficient to set all the rest of the company a yawning a ridiculous instance of this was commonly practiced upon the famous mlaurin one of the professors at edinburgh he was very subject to have his jaw dislocated so that when he opened his mouth wider than ordinary or when he yawned he could not shut it again in the midst of his harangues therefore if any of his pupils began to be tired of his lecture he had only to gape or yawn and the professor instantly caught the sympathetic affection so that he thus continued to stand speechless with his mouth wide open till his servant from the next room was called in to set his jaw again  when the mind reflects with regret upon some good unattained or lost it feels an internal emotion which acting upon the diaphragm and that upon the lungs produces a sigh this when the mind is strongly affected is repeated sorrow succeeds these first emotions and tears are often seen to follow sobbing is the sigh still more invigorated and lamentation or crying proceeds from the continuance of the plaintive tone of the voice which seems to implore pity there is yet a silent agony in which the mind appears to disdain all external help and broods over its distresses with gloomy reserve this is the most dangerous state of mind accidents or friendship may lessen the louder kinds of grief but all remedies for this must be had from within and there despair too often finds the most deadly enemy  laughter is a sound of the voice interrupted and pursued for some continuance the muscles of the belly and the diaphragm are employed in its slightest exertions but those of the ribs are strongly agitated in the louder and the head sometimes is thrown backward in order to raise them with greater ease the smile is often an indication of kindness and good will it is also often used as a mark of contempt and ridicule  blushing proceeds from different passions being produced by shame anger pride and joy paleness is often also the effect of anger and almost ever attendant on fright and fear these alterations in the color of the countenance are entirely involuntary all the other expressions of the passions are in some small degree under control but blushing and paleness betray our secret purposes and we might as well attempt to stop them as the circulation of the blood by which they are caused  the whole head as well as the features of the face takes peculiar attitudes from its passions it bends forward to express humility shame or sorrow it is turned to one side in languor or in pity it is thrown with the chin forward in arrogance and pride erect in selfconceit and obstinacy it is thrown backwards in astonishment and combines its motions to the one side and the other to express contempt ridicule anger and resentment painters whose study leads to the contemplation of external forms are much more adequate judges of these than any naturalist can be and it is with these a general remark that no one passion is regularly expressed on different countenances in the same manner but that grief often sits upon the face like joy and pride assumes the air of passion it would be vain therefore in words to express their general effect since they are often as various as the countenances they sit upon and in making this distinction nicely lies all the skill of the physiognomist in being able to distinguish what part of the face is marked by nature and what by the mind what part has been originally formed and what is made by habit constitutes this science upon which the ancients so much valued themselves and which we at present so little regard some however of the most acute men among us have paid great attention to this art and by long practice have been able to give some character of every person whose face they examined montaigne is well known to have disliked those men who shut one eye in looking upon any object and fielding asserts that he never knew a person with a steady glavering smile but he found him a rogue however most of these observations tending to a discovery of the mind by the face are merely capricious and nature has kindly hid our hearts from each other to keep us in good humor with our fellow creatures  the parts of the head which give the least expression to the face are the ears and they are generally found hidden under the hair these which are immovable and make so small an appearance in man are very distinguishing features in quadrupedes they serve in them as the principal marks of the passions the ears discover their joys or their terrors with tolerable precision and denote all their internal agitations the smallest ears in men are said to be most beautiful but the largest are found the best for hearing there are some savage nations who bore their ears and so draw that part down that the tips of the ears are seen to rest upon their shoulders  the strange variety in the different customs of men appears still more extravagant in their manner of wearing their beards some and among others the turks cut the hair off their heads and let their beards grow the europeans on the contrary shave their beards and wear their hair the negroes shave their heads in figures at one time in stars at another in the manner of friars and still more commonly in alternate stripes and their little boys are shaved in the same manner the talapoins of siam shave the heads and the eyebrows of such children as are committed to their care every nation seems to have entertained different prejudices at different times in favor of one part or another of the beard some have admired the hair upon the cheeks on each side as we see with some lowbred men among ourselves who want to be fine some like the hair lower down some choose it curled and others like it strait some have cut it into a peak and others shave all but the whisker this particular part of the beard was highly prized among the spaniards till of late a man without whiskers was considered as unfit for company and where nature had denied them art took care to supply the deficiency we are told of a spanish general who when he borrowed a large sum of money from the venetians pawned his whisker which he afterward took proper care to release kingson assures us that a considerable part of the religion of the tartars consists in the management of their whiskers and that they waged a long and bloody war with the persians declaring them infidels merely because they would not give their whiskers the orthodox cut the kings of persia carried the care of their beards to a ridiculous excess when they chose to wear them matted with gold thread and the kings of france themselves of the first races had them knotted and buttoned with gold but of all nations the americans take the greatest pains in cutting their hair and plucking their beards the under part of the beard and all but the whisker they take care to pluck up by the roots so that many have supposed them to have no hair naturally growing on that part and even linnaeus himself has fallen into that mistake their hair is also cut into bands and no small care employed in adjusting the whisker in fact we have a very wrong idea of savage finery and are apt to suppose that like the beasts of the forest they rise and are dressed with a shake but the reverse is true for no birthnight beauty takes more time or pains in the adorning her person than they i remember when the cherokee kings were over here that i have waited for three hours during the time they were dressing they never would venture to make their appearance till they had gone through the tedious ceremonies of the toilet they had their boxes of oil and oker their fat and their perfumes like the most effeminate beau and generally took up four hours in dressing before they considered themselves as fit to be seen we must not therefore consider a delicacy in point of dress as a mark of refinement since savages are much more difficult in this particular than the most fashionable or tawdry european the more barbarous the people the fonder of finery in europe the luster of jewels and the splendour of the most brilliant colors are generally given up to women or to the weakest part of the other sex who are willing to be contemptibly fine but in asia these trifling fineries are eagerly sought after by every condition of men and as the proverb has it we find the richest jewels in an aethiops ear the passion for glittering ornaments is still stronger among the absolute barbarians who often exchange their whole stock of provisions and whatever else they happen to be possessed of with our seamen for a glass bead or a lookingglass  although fashions have arisen in different countries from fancy and caprice these when they become general deserve examination mankind have always considered it as a matter of moment and they will ever continue desirous of drawing the attention of each other by such ornaments as mark the riches the power or the courage of the wearer the value of those shining stones which have at all times been considered as precious ornaments is entirely founded upon their scarceness or their brilliancy it is the same likewise with respect to those shining metals the weight of which is so little regarded when spread over our clothes these ornaments are rather designed to draw the attention of others than to add to any enjoyments of our own and few there are that these ornaments will not serve to dazzle and who can coolly distinguish between the metal and the man  all things rare and brilliant will therefore ever continue to be fashionable while men derive greater advantages from opulence than virtue while the means of appearing considerable are more easily acquired than the title to be considered the first impression we generally make arises from our dress and this varies in conformity to our inclinations and the manner in which we desire to be considered the modest man or he who would wish to be thought so desires to show the simplicity of his mind by the plainness of his dress the vain man on the contrary takes a pleasure in displaying his superiority and is willing to incur the spectators dislike so he does but excite his attention  another point of view which men have in dressing is to increase the size of their figure and to take up more room in the world than nature seems to have allotted them we desire to swell out our clothes by the stiffness of art and raise our heels while we add to the largeness of our heads how bulky soever our dress may be our vanities are still more bulky the largeness of the doctors wig arises from the same pride with the smallness of the beaus queue both want to have the size of their understanding measured by the size of their heads  there are some modes that seem to have a more reasonable origin which is to hide or to lessen the defects of nature to take men altogether there are many more deformed and plain than beautiful and shapely the former as being the most numerous give law to fashion and their laws are generally such as are made in their own favor the women begin to color their cheeks with red when the natural roses are faded and the younger are obliged to submit though not compelled by the same necessity in all parts of the world this custom prevails more or less and powdering and frizzing the hair though not so general seems to have arisen from a similar control  but leaving the draperies of the human picture let us return to the figure unadorned by art mans head whether considered externally or internally is differently formed from that of all other animals the monkeykind only excepted in which there is a striking similitude there are some differences however which we shall take notice of in another place the bodies of all quadrupede animals are covered with hair but the head of man seems the part most adorned and that more abundantly than in any other animal  there is a very great variety in the teeth of all animals some have them above and below others have them in the under jaw only in some they stand separate from each other while in some they are continued and united the palate of some fishes is nothing else but a bony plate studded with points which perform the offices of teeth all these substances in every animal derive their origin from the nerves the substance of the nerves hardens by being exposed to the air and the nerves that terminate in the mouth being thus exposed acquire a bony solidity in this manner the teeth and nails are formed in man and in this manner also the beak the hoofs the horns and the talons of other animals are found to be produced  the neck supports the head and unites it to the body this part is much more considerable in the generality of quadrupedes than in man but fishes and other animals that want lungs similar to ours have no neck whatsoever birds in general have the neck longer than any other kind of animals those of them which have short claws have also short necks those on the contrary that have them long are found to have the neck in proportion in men there is a lump upon the windpipe formed by the thuroid cartilage which is not to be seen in women an arabian fable says that this is a part of the original apple that has stuck in the mans throat by the way but that the woman swallowed her part of it down  the human breast is outwardly formed in a very different manner from that of other animals it is larger in proportion to the size of the body and none but man and such animals as make use of their fore feet as hands such as monkies bats and squirrels are found to have those bones called the clavicles or as we usually term them the collarbones mr buffon says that none but monkeys have them but this is an oversight  the breasts in women are larger than in men however they seem formed in the same manner and sometimes milk is found in the breasts of men as well as in those of women among animals there is a great variety in this part of the body the teats of some as in the ape and the elephant are like those of men being but two and placed on each side of the breast the teats of the bear amount to four the sheep has but two placed between the hinder legs other animals such as the bitch and the sow have them all along the belly and as they produce many young they have a great many teats for their support the form also of the teats varies in different animals and in the same animal at different ages the bosom in females seems to unite all our ideas of beauty where the outline is continually changing and the gradations are soft and regular  the graceful fall of the shoulders both in man and woman constitute no small part of beauty in apes though otherwise made like us the shoulders are high and drawn up on each side toward the ears in man they fall by a gentle declivity and the more so in proportion to the beauty of his form in fact being high shouldered is not without reason considered as a deformity for we find very sickly persons are always so and people when dying are ever seen with their shoulders drawn up in a surprising manner the muscles that serve to raise the ribs mostly rise near the shoulders and the higher we raise the shoulders we the more easily raise the ribs likewise it happens therefore in the sickly and the dying who do not breathe without labor that to raise the ribs they are obliged to call in the assistance of the shoulders and thus their bodies assume from habit that form which they are so frequently obliged to assume women with child also are usually seen to be high shouldered for the weight of the inferior parts drawing down the ribs they are obliged to use every effort to elevate them and thus they raise the shoulders of course during pregnancy also the shape not only of the shoulders but also of the breast and even the features of the face are greatly altered for the whole upper forepart of the body is covered with a broad thin skin called the myoides which being at that time drawn down it draws down with it the skin and consequently the features of the face by this means the visage takes a particular form the lower eyelids and the corners of the mouth are drawn downwards so that the eyes are enlarged and the mouth lengthened and women in these circumstances are said by the midwives to be all mouth and eyes  the arms of men but very little resemble the fore feet of quadrupedes and much less the wings of birds the ape is the only animal that is possessed of hands and arms but these are much more rudely fashioned and with less exact proportion than in men the thumb not being so well opposed to the rest of the fingers in their hands as in ours  the form of the back is not much different in man from that of other quadrupede animals only that the reins are more muscular in him and stronger the buttock however in man is different from that of all other animals whatsoever what goes by that name in other creatures is only the upper part of the thigh man being the only animal that supports himself perfectly erect the peculiar largeness of this part is owing to the peculiarity of his position  mans feet also are different from those of all other animals those even of apes not excepted the foot of the ape is rather a kind of awkward hand its toes or rather fingers are long and that of the middle longest of all this foot also wants the heel as in man the sole also is narrower and less adapted to maintain the equilibrium of the body in walking dancing or running  the nails are less in man than in any other animal if they were much longer than the extremities of the fingers they would rather be prejudicial than serviceable and obstruct the management of the hand such savages as let them grow long make use of them in fleaing animals in tearing their flesh and such like purposes however though their nails are considerably larger than ours they are by no means to be compared to the hoofs or the claws of other animals they may sometimes be seen longer indeed than the claws of any animal whatsoever as we learn that the nails of some of the learned men in china are longer than their fingers but these want that solidity which might give force to their exertions and could never in a state of nature have served them for annoyance or defense  there is little known exactly with regard to the proportion of the human figure and the beauty of the best statues is better conceived by observing than by measuring them the statues of antiquity which were at first copied after the human form are now become the models of it nor is there one man found whose person any way approaches to those inimitable performances that have thus in one figure united the perfections of many it is sufficient to say that from being at first models they are now become orginals and are used to correct the deviations in that form from whence they were taken i will not however pretend to give the proportions of the human body as taken from these there being nothing more arbitrary and which good painters themselves so much contemn some for instance who have studied after these divide the body into ten times the length of the face and others into eight some pretend to tell us that there is a similitude of proportion in different parts of the body thus that the hand is the length of the face the thumb the length of the nose the space between the eyes is the breadth of an eye that the breadth of the thigh at thickest is double that of the thickest part of the leg and treble the smallest that the arms extended are just as long as the figure is high that the legs and thighs are just half the length of the figure all this however is extremely arbitrary and the excellence of a shape or the beauty of a statue results from the attitude and position of the whole rather than any established measurements begun without experience and adopted by caprice in general it may be remarked that the proportions alter in every age and are obviously different in the two sexes in woman the shoulders are narrower and the neck proportionably longer than in men the hips also are considerably larger and the thighs much shorter than in men these proportions however vary greatly at different ages in infancy the upper parts of the body are much larger than the lower the legs and thighs do not constitute any thing like half the height of the whole figure in proportion as the child increases in age the inferior parts are found to lengthen so that the body is not equally divided until it has acquired its full growth  the size of men varies considerably men are said to be tall who are from five feet eight inches to six feet high the middle stature is from five feet five to five feet eight and these are said to be of small stature who fall under these measures however it ought to be remarked that the same person is always taller when he rises in the morning than upon going to bed at night and sometimes there is an inch difference and i have seen more few persons are sensible of this remarkable variation and i am told it was first perceived in england by a recruiting officer he often found that that those men whom he had enlisted for soldiers and answered to the appointed standard at one time fell short of it when they came to be measured before the colonel at the head quarters this dimunition in their size proceeded from the different times of the day and the different states of the body when they happened to be measured if as was said they were measured in the morning after the nights refreshment they were found to be commonly half an inch and very often a whole inch taller than in measured after the fatigues of the day if they were measured when fresh in the country and before a long fatiguing march to the regiment they were found to be an inch taller than when they arrived at their journeys end all this is now well known among those who recruit for the army and the reason of this difference of stature is obvious between all the joints of the backbone which is composed of several pieces there is a glutinous liquor deposited which serves like oil in a machine to give the parts an easy play upon each other this lubricating liquor or synovia as the anatomists call it is poured in during the season of repose and is consumed by exercise and employment so that in a body after hard labor there is scarce any of it remaining but all the joints grow stiff and their motion becomes hard and painful it is from hence therefore that the body diminishes in stature for this moisture being drained away from between the numerous joints of the backbone they lie closer upon each other and their whole length is thus very sensibly diminished but sleep once more by restoring the fluid again swells the spaces between the joints and the whole is extended to its former dimensions as the human body is thus often found to differ from itself in size so it is found to differ in its weight also and the same person without any apparent cause is found to be heavier at one time than another if after having eaten an hearty dinner or having drank hard the person should find himself thus heavier it would appear no way extraordinary but the fact is the body is very often found heavier some hours after eating an hearty meal than immediately succeeding it if for instance a person fatigued by a days hard labor should eat a plentiful supper and then get himself weighed upon going to bed after sleeping soundly if he is again weighed he will find himself considerably heavier than before and this difference is often found to amount to a pound or sometimes to a pound and a half from whence this adventitious weight is derived is not easy to conceive the body during the whole night appears rather plentifully perspiring than imbibing any fluid rather losing than gaining moisture however we have no reason to doubt but that either by the lungs or perhaps by a peculiar set of pores it is all this time inhaling a quantity of fluid which thus increases the weight of the whole body upon being weighed the next morning from this experiment also the learned may gather upon what a weak foundation the whole doctrine of sanctorian perspiration is built but this disquisition more properly belongs to medicine than natural history     although the human body is externally more delicate than any in of the quadrupede kind it is notwithstanding extremely muscular and perhaps for its size stronger than that of any other animal whatsoever if we should offer to compare the strength of the lion with that of man we should consider that the claws of this animal give us a false idea of its power we ascribe to its force what is only the effects of its arms those which man has received from nature are not offensive happy had art never furnished him with any more terrible than those which arm the paws of the lion  but there is another manner mr buffon calls it a better manner but this is not the case of comparing the strength of man with that of other animals namely by the weights which either can carry we are assured that the porters of constantinople carry burdens of nine hundred pounds weight mr desaguliers tells us of a man who by distributing weights in such a manner as that every part of his body bore its share he was thus able to raise a weight of two thousand pounds an horse which is about seven times our bulk would be thus able to raise a weight of fourteen thousand pounds if its strength were in the same proportion mr buffon carries this subject no farther and thus far without explanation it is erroneous  but the truth is an horse will not carry upon its back above a weight of two or three hundred pounds while a man of confessedly inferior strength is thus able to support two thousand whence comes this seeming superiority the answer is obvious because the load upon mans shoulders is placed to the greatest advantage while upon the horses back it is placed at the greatest disadvantage let us suppose for a moment the man standing as upright as possible under the great load abovementioned it is obvious that all the bones of his body may be compared to a pillar supporting a building and that his muscles have scarce any share in this dangerous duty however they are not entirely inactive as man let him stand never so upright will have some bending in the different parts of his body the muscles therefore give the bones some assistance and that with the greatest possible advantage in this manner therefore a man has been found to support two thousand weight but may be capable of supporting a still greater the manner in which this is done is by strapping the load round the shoulders of the person who is to bear it by a machine something like that by which milk vessels or waterbuckets are carried the load being thus placed on a scaffold on each side contrived for that purpose and the man standing erect in the midst all parts of the scaffold except that where the man stands are made to sink and thus the man maintaining his position the load whatever it is becomes suspended and the column of his bones may be fairly said to support it if however he should but ever so little give way he must inevitably drop and no power of his can raise the weights again but the case is very different with regard to a load laid upon an horse the column of the bones there lies a different way and a weight of five hundred pounds as i am told would break the back of the strongest horse that could be found the great force of an horse and other quadrupedes is exerted when the load is in such a position as that the column of the bones can be properly applied which is lengthwise when therefore we are to estimate the comparative strength of an horse we are not to try what he can carry but what he can draw and in this case his amazing superiority over man is easily discerned for one horse can draw a load that ten men cannot move and in some cases it happens that a draft horse draws the better for being somewhat loaded for as the peasants say the load upon his back keeps him the better to the ground  there is still another way of estimating human strength by the perseverance and agility of our motions men who are exercised in running outstrip horses or at least hold their speed for a longer continuance in a journey also a man will walk down a horse and after they have both continued to proceed for several days the horse will be quite tired and the man will be fresher than in the beginning the kings messengers of ispahan who are runners by profession go thirtysix leagues in fourteen hours travelers assure us that the hottentots outstrip lions in the chase and that the savages who hunt the elk pursue with such speed that they at last tire down and take it we are told many very surprising things of the great swiftness of the savages and of the long journeys they undertake on foot through the most craggy mountains where there are no paths to direct nor houses to entertain them they are said to perform a journey of twelve hundred leagues in less than six weeks but notwithstanding what travelers report of this matter i have been assured from many of our officers and soldiers who compared their own swiftness with that of the native americans during the last war that although the savages held out and as the phrase is had better bottom yet for a spurt the englishmen were more nimble and speedy  nevertheless in general civilized man is ignorant of his own powers he is ignorant how much he loses by effeminacy and what might be acquired by habit and exercise here and there indeed men are found among us of extraordinary strength but that strength for want of opportunity is seldom called into exertion among the ancients it was a quality of much greater use than at present as in war the same man that had strength sufficient to carry the heaviest armor had strength sufficient also to strike the most fatal blow in this case his strength was at once his protection and his power we ought not to be surprised therefore when we hear of one man terrible to an army and irresistible in his career as we find some generals represented in ancient history but we may be very certain that this prowess was exaggerated by flattery and exalted by terror an age of ignorance is ever an age of wonder at such times mankind having no just ideas of the human powers are willing rather to represent what they wish than what they know and exalt human strength to fill up the whole sphere of their limited conceptions great strength is an accidental thing two or three in a country may possess it and these may have a claim to heroism but what may lead us to doubt of the veracity of these accounts is that the heroes of antiquity are represented as the sons of heroes their amazing strength is delivered down from father to son and this we know to be contrary to the course of nature strength is not hereditary although titles are and i am very much induced to believe that this great tribe of heroes who are all represented as the descendants of heroes are more obliged to their titles than to their strength for their characters with regard to the shining characters in homer they are all represented as princes and as the sons of princes while we are told of scarce any share of prowess whatsoever in the meaner men of the army who are only brought into the field for these to protect or to slaughter but nothing can be more unlikely than that those men who were bred in the luxury of courts should be strong while the whole body of the people who received a plainer and simpler education should be comparatively weak nothing can be more contrary to the general laws of nature than that all the sons of heroes should thus inherit not only the kingdoms but the strength of their forefathers and we may conclude that they owe the greatest share of their imputed strength rather to the dignity of their stations than the force of their arms and like all fortunate princes their flatterers happened to be believed in later ages indeed we have some accounts of amazing strength which we can have no reason to doubt of but in these nature is found to pursue her ordinary course and we find their strength accidental we find these strong men among the lowest of the people and gradually rising into notice as this superiority had more opportunity of being seen of this number was the roman tribune who went by the name of the second achilles who with his own hand killed at different times three hundred of the enemy and when treacherously set upon by twentyfive of his own countrymen although then past his sixtieth year killed fourteen of them before he was slain of this number was milo who when he stood upright could not be forced out of his place pliny also tells us of one athanatus who walked across the stage at rome loaded with a breast plate weighing five hundred pounds and buskins of the same weight but of all the prodigies of strength of whom we have any accounts in roman history maximin the emperor is to be reckoned the foremost whatever we are told relative to him is well attested his character was too exalted not to be thoroughly known and that very strength for which he was celebrated at last procured him no less a reward than the empire of the world maximin was above nine feet in height and the best proportioned man in the whole empire he was by birth a thracian and from being a simple herdsman rose through the gradations of office until he came to be emperor of rome the first opportunity he had of exerting his strength was in the presence of all the citizens in the theater where he overthrew twelve of the strongest men in wrestling and outstript two of the fleetest horses in running all in one day he could draw a chariot laden that two strong horses could not move he could break a horses jaw with a blow of his fist and its thigh with a kick in war he was always foremost and invincible happy had it been for him and his subjects if from being formidable to his enemies he had not become still more so to his subjects he reigned for some time with all the world his enemy all mankind wishing him dead yet none daring to strike the blow as if fortune had resolved that through life he should continue unconquerable he was killed at last by his own soldiers while he was sleeping we have many other instances in later ages of very great strength and not fewer of amazing swiftness but these merely corporeal perfections are now considered as of small advantage either in war or in peace the invention of gunpowder has in some measure levelled down all force to one standard and has wrought a total change in human education through all parts of the world in peace also the invention of new machines every day and the application of the strength of the lower animals to the purposes of life have rendered human strength less valuable the boast of corporeal force is now therefore consigned to savage nations where those arts not being introduced it may still be needful but in more polite countries few will be proud of that strength which other animals can be taught to exert to as useful purposes as they if we compare the largeness and thickness of our muscles with those of any other animal we shall find that in this respect we have the advantage and if strength or swiftness depended upon the quantity of muscular flesh alone i believe that in this respect we should be more active and powerful than any other but this is not the case a great deal more than the size of the muscles goes to constitute activity or force and it is not he who has the thickest legs that can make the best use of them those therefore who have written elaborate treatises on muscular force and have estimated the strength of animals by the thickness of their muscles have been employed to very little purpose it is in general observed that thin and rawboned men are always stronger and more powerful than such as are seemingly more muscular as in the former all the parts have better room for their exertions    women want much of the strength of men and in some countries the stronger sex have availed themselves of this superiority in cruelly and tyranically enslaving those who were made with equal pretensions to a share in all the advantages life can bestow savage nations oblige their women to a life of continual labor upon them rests all the drudgeries of domestic duty while the husband indolently reclined in his hammock is first served from the fruits of her industry from this negligent situation he is seldom rouzed except by the calls of appetite when it is necessary either by fishing or hunting to make a variety in his entertainments a savage has no idea of taking pleasure in exercise he is surprised to see an european walk forward for his amusement and then return back again as for his part he could be contented to remain for ever in the same situation perfectly satisfied with sensual pleasures and undisturbed repose the women therefore of these countries are the greatest slaves upon earth sensible of their weakness and unable to resist they are obliged to suffer those hardships which are naturally inflicted by such as have been taught that nothing but corporeal force ought to give preeminence it is not therefore till after some degree of refinement that women are treated with lenity and not till the highest degree of politeness that they are permitted to share in all the privileges of man the first impulse of savage nature is to confirm their slavery the next of half barbarous nations is to appropriate their beauty and that of the perfectly polite to engage their affections in civilized countries therefore women have united the force of modesty to the power of their natural charms and thus obtain that superiority over the mind which they are unable to extort by their strength  chap vi of sleep and hunger as man in all the privileges he enjoys and the powers he is invested with has a superiority over all other animals so in his necessities he seems inferior to the meanest of them all nature has brought him into life with a greater variety of wants and infirmities than the rest of her creatures unarmed in the midst of enemies the lion has natural arms the bear natural clothing but man is destitute of all such advantages and from the superiority of his mind alone he is to supply the deficiency the number of his wants however were merely given in order to multiply the number of his enjoyments since the possibility of being deprived of any good teaches him the value of its possession were man born with those advantages which he learns to possess by industry he would very probably enjoy them with a blunter relish it is by being naked that he knows the value of a covering it is by being exposed to the weather that he learns the comforts of an habitation every want thus becomes a means of pleasure in the redressing and that animal that has most desires may be said to be capable of the greatest variety of happiness  beside the thousand imaginary wants peculiar to man only there are two which he has in common with all other animals and which he feels in a more necessary manner than they these are the wants of sleep and hunger every animal that we are acquainted with seems to endure the want of these with much less injury to health than man and some are most surprizingly patient in sustaining both the little domestic animals that we keep about us may often set a lesson of calm resignation in supporting want and watchfulness to the boasted philosopher they receive their pittance at uncertain intervals and wait its coming with cheerful expectation we have instances of the dog and the cat living in this manner without food for several days and yet still preserving their attachment to the tyrant that oppresses them still ready to exert their little services for his amusement or defense but the patience of these is nothing to what the animals of the forest endure as these mostly live upon accidental carnage so they are often known to remain without food for several weeks together nature kindly solicitous for their support has also contracted their stomachs to suit them for their precarious way of living and kindly while it abridges the banquet lessens the necessity of providing for it but the meaner tribes of animals are made still more capable of sustaining life without food many of them remaining in a state of torpid indifference till their prey approaches when they jump upon and seize it in this manner the snake or the spider continue for several months together to subsist upon a single meal and some of the butterfly kinds actually live upon nothing but it is very different with man his wants daily make their importunate demands and it is supposed that he cannot continue to live four days without eating drinking and sleeping  hunger is a much more powerful enemy to man than watchfulness and kills him much sooner it may be considered as a disorder that food removes and that would quickly be fatal without its proper antidote in fact it is so terrible to man that to avoid it he even encounters certain death and rather than endure its tortures exchanges them for immediate destruction however by what i have been told it is much more dreadful in its approaches than in its continuance and the pains of a famishing wretch decrease as his strength diminishes in the beginning the desire of food is dreadful indeed as we know by experience for there are few who have not in some degree felt its approaches but after the first or second day its tortures become less terrible and a total insensibility at length comes kindly in to the poor wretchs assistance i have talked with the captain of a ship who was one of six that endured it in its extremities and who was the only person that had not lost his senses when they received accidental relief he assured me his pains at first were so great as to be often tempted to eat a part of one of the men who died and which the rest of his crew actually for some time lived upon he said that during the continuance of this paroxysm he found his pains insupportable and was desirous at one time of anticipating that death which he thought inevitable but his pains he said gradually decreased after the sixth day for they had water in the ship which kept them alive so long and then he was in a state rather of languor than desire nor did he much wish for food except when he saw others eating and that for a while revived his appetite though with diminished importunity the latter part of the time when his health was almost destroyed a thousand strange images rose upon his mind and every one of his senses began to bring him wrong information the most fragrant perfumes appeared to him to have a foetid smell and every thing he looked at took a greenish hue and sometimes a yellow when he was presented with food by the ships company that took him and his men up four of whom died shortly after he could not help looking upon it with loathing instead of desire and it was not till after four days that his stomach was brought to its natural tone when the violence of his appetite returned with a sort of canine eagerness  thus dreadful are the effects of hunger and yet when we come to assign the cause that produces them we find the subject involved in doubt and intricacy this longing eagerness is no doubt given for a very obvious purpose that of replenishing the body wasted by fatigue and perspiration were not men stimulated by such a pressing monitor they might be apt to pursue other amusements with a perseverance beyond their power and forget the useful hours of refreshment in those more tempting ones of pleasure but hunger makes a demand that will not be refused and indeed the generality of mankind seldom await the call  hunger has been supposed by some to arise from the rubbing of the coats of the stomach against each other without having any intervening substance to prevent their painful attrition others have imagined that its juices wanting their necessary supply turn acrid or as some say pungent and thus fret its internal coats so as to produce a train of the most uneasy sensations boerhaave who made his reputation in physic by uniting the conjectures of all those that preceded him ascribes hunger to the united effect of both these causes and asserts that the pungency of the gastric juices and the attrition of its coats against each other cause those pains which nothing but food can remove these juices continuing still to be separated in the stomach and every moment becoming more acrid mix with the blood and infect the circulation the circulation being thus contaminated becomes weaker and more contracted and the whole nervous frame sympathizing an hectic fever and sometimes madness is produced in which state the faint wretch expires in this manner the man who dies of hunger may be said to be poisoned by the juices of his own body and is destroyed less by the want of nourishment than by the vitiated qualities of that which he had already taken  however this may be we have but few instances of men dying except at sea of absolute hunger the decline of those unhappy creatures who are destitute of food at land being more slow and unperceived these from often being in need and as often receiving an accidental supply pass their lives between surfeiting and repining and their constitution is impaired by insensible degrees man is unfit for a state of precarious expectation that share of provident precaution which incites him to lay up stores for a distant day becomes his torment when totally unprovided against an immediate call the lower race of animals when satisfied for the instant moment are perfectly happy but it is otherwise with man his mind anticipates distress and feels the pangs of want even before it arrests him thus the mind being continually harrassed by the situation it at length influences the constitution and unfits it for all its functions some cruel disorder but no way like hunger seizes the unhappy sufferer so that almost all those men who have thus long lived by chance and whose every day may be considered as an happy escape from famine are known at last to die in reality of a disorder caused by hunger but which in the common language is often called a brokenheart some of these i have known myself when very little able to relieve them and i have been told by a very active and worthy magistrate that the number of such as die in london for want is much greater than one would imagine  i think he talked of two thousand in a year  but how numerous soever those who die of hunger may be many times greater on the other hand are the number of those who die by repletion it is not the province of the present page to speculate with the physician upon the danger of surfeits or with the moralist upon the nauseousness of gluttony it will only be proper to observe that as nothing is so prejudicial to health as hunger by constraint so nothing is more beneficial to the constitution than voluntary abstinence it was not without reason that religion enjoined this duty since it answered the double purpose of restoring the health oppressed by luxury and diminished the consumption of provisions so that a part might come to the poor it should be the business of the legistature therefore to enforce this divine precept and thus by restraining one part of mankind in the use of their superfluities to consult for the benefit of those who want the necessaries of life the injunctions for abstinence are strict over the whole continent and were rigorously observed even among ourselves for a long time after the reformation queen elizabeth by giving her commands upon this head the air of a political injunction lessened in a great measure and in my opinion very unwisely the religious force of the obligation she enjoined that her subjects should fast from flesh on fridays and saturdays but at the same time declared that this was not commanded from motives of religion as if there were any differences in meats but merely to favor the consumption of fish and thus to multiply the number of mariners and also to spare the stock of sheep which might be more beneficial in another way in this manner the injunction defeated its own force and this most salutary law became no longer binding when it was supposed to come purely from man how far it may be enjoined in the scriptures i will not take upon me to say but this may be asserted that if the utmost benefit to the individual and the most extensive advantage to society serve to mark any institution as of heaven this of abstinence may be reckoned among the foremost  were we to give an history of the various benefits that have arisen from this command and how conducive it has been to long life the instances would fatigue with their multiplicity it is surprising to what a great age the primitive christians of the east who retired from persecution in the deserts of arabia continued to live in all the bloom of health and yet all the rigours of abstemious discipline their common allowance as we are told for four and twenty hours was twelve ounces of bread and nothing but water on this simple beverage st anthony is said to have lived an hundred and five years james the hermit an hundred and four arsenius tutor to the emperor arcadius an hundred and twenty st epiphanius an hundred and fifteen simeon an hundred and twelve and rombald an hundred and twenty in this manner did these holy temperate men live to an extreme old age kept cheerful by strong hopes and healthful by moderate labor  abstinence which is thus voluntary may be much more easily supported than constrained hunger man is said to live without food for seven days which is the usual limit assigned him and perhaps in a state of constraint this is the longest time he can survive the want of it but in cases of voluntary abstinence of sickness or sleeping he has been known to live much longer  in the records of the tower there is an account of a scotchman imprisoned for felony who for the space of six weeks took not the least sustenance being exactly watched during the whole time and for this he received the kings pardon  when the american indians undertake long journies and when consequently a stock of provisions sufficient to support them the whole way would be more than they could carry in order to obviate this inconvenience instead of carrying the necessary quantity they contrive a method of palliating their hunger by swallowing pills made of calcined shells and tobacco these pills take away all appetite by producing a temporary disorder in the stomach and no doubt the frequent repetition of this wretched expedient must at last be fatal by this means however they continue several days without eating cheerfully bearing such extremes of fatigue and watching as would quickly destroy men bred up in a greater state of delicacy for those arts by which we learn to obviate our necessities do not fail to unfit us for their accidental encounter  upon the whole therefore man is less able to support hunger than any other animal and he is not better qualified to support a state of watchfulness indeed sleep seems much more necessary to him than to any other creature as when awake he may be said to exhaust a greater proportion of the nervous fluid and consequently to stand in need of an adequate supply other animals when most awake are but little removed from a state of slumber their feeble faculties imprisoned in matter and rather exerted by impulse than deliberation require sleep rather as a cessation from motion than from thinking but it is otherwise with man his ideas fatigued with their various excursions demand a cessation not less than the body from toil and he is the only creature that seems to require sleep from double motives not less for the refreshment of the mental than of the bodily frame  there are some lower animals indeed that seem to spend the greatest part of their lives in sleep but properly speaking the sleep of such may be considered as a kind of death and their waking a resurrection flies and insects are said to be asleep at a time that all the vital motions have ceased without respiration without any circulation of their juices if cut in pieces they do not awake nor does any fluid ooze out at the wound these may be considered rather as congealed than as sleeping animals and their rest during winter rather as a cessation from life than a necessary refreshment but in the higher races of animals whose blood is not thus congealed and thawed by heat these all bear the want of sleep much better than man and some of them continue a long time without seeming to take any refreshment from it whatsoever  but man is more feeble he requires its due return and if it fails to pay the accustomed visit his whole frame is in a short time thrown into disorder his appetite ceases his spirits are dejected his pulse becomes quicker and harder and his mind abridged of its slumbering visions begins to adopt waking dreams a thousand strange phantoms arise which come and go without his will these which are transient in the beginning at last take firm possession of the mind which yields to their dominion and after a long struggle runs into confirmed madness in that horrid state the mind may be considered as a city without walls open to every insult and paying homage to every invader every idea that then starts with any force becomes a reality and the reason over fatigued with its former importunities makes no head against the tyrannical invasion but submits to it from mere imbecility  but it is happy for mankind that this state of inquietude is seldom driven to an extreme and that there are medicines which seldom fail to give relief however man finds it more difficult than any other animal to procure sleep and some are obliged to court its approaches for several hours together before they incline to rest it is in vain that all light is excluded that all sounds are removed that warmth and softness conspire to invite it the restless and busy mind still retains its former activity and reason that wishes to lay down the reins in spite of herself is obliged to maintain them in this disagreeable state the mind passes from thought to thought willing to lose the distinctness of perception by increasing the multitude of the images at last when the approaches of sleep are near every object of the imagination begins to mix with that next it their outlines become in a manner rounder a part of their distinctions fade away and sleep that ensues fashions out a dream from the remainder  if then it should be asked from what cause this state of repose proceeds or in what manner sleep thus binds us for several hours together i must fairly confess my ignorance although it is easy to tell what philosophers say upon the subject sleep says one of them rohault  consists in a scarcity of spirits by which the orifices or pores of the nerves in the brain through which the spirits used to flow into the nerves being no longer kept open by the frequency of the spirits shut of themselves thus the nerves wanting a new supply of spirits become lax and unfit to convey any impression to the brain all this however is explaining a very great obscurity by somewhat more obscure leaving therefore those spirits to open and shut the entrances to the brain let us be contented with simply enumerating the effects of sleep upon the human constitution  in sleep the whole nervous frame is relaxed while the heart and the lungs seem more forcibly exerted this fuller circulation produces also a swelling of the muscles as they always find who steep with ligatures on any part of their body this increased circulation also may be considered as a kind of exercise which is continued through the frame and by this the perspiration becomes more copious although the appetite for food is entirely taken away too much sleep dulls the apprehension weakens the memory and unfits the body for labor on the contrary sleep too much abridged emaciates the frame produces melancholy and consumes the constitution it requires some care therefore to regulate the quantity of sleep and just to take as much as will completely restore nature without oppressing it the poor as otway says sleep little forced by their situation to lengthen out their labor to their necessities they have but a short interval for this pleasing refreshment and i have ever been of opinion that bodily labor demands a less quantity of sleep than mental laborers and artizans are generally satisfied with about seven hours but i have known some scholars who usually slept nine and perceived their faculties no way impaired by oversleeping  the famous philip barrettiere who was considered as a prodigy of learning at the age of fourteen was known to sleep regularly twelve hours in the twentyfour the extreme activity of his mind when awake in some measure called for an adequate alternation of repose and i am apt to think that when students stint themselves in this particular they lessen the waking powers of the imagination and unfit it for its most strenuous exertions animals that seldom think as was said can very easily dispense with sleep and of men such as think least will very probably be satisfied with the smallest share a life of study it is well known unfits the body for receiving this gentle refreshment the approaches of sleep are driven off by thinking when therefore it comes at last we should not be too ready to interrupt its continuance  sleep is indeed to some a very agreeable period of their existence and it has been a question in the schools which was most happy the man who was a beggar by night and a king by day or he who was a beggar by day and a king by night it is given in favor of the nightly monarch by him who first started the question for the dream says he gives the full enjoyment of the dignity without its attendant inconveniences while on the other hand the king who supposes himself degraded feels all the misery of his fallen fortune without trying to find the comforts of his humble situation thus by day both states have their peculiar distresses but by night the exalted beggar is perfectly blessed and the king completely miserable all this however is rather fanciful than just the pleasure dreams can give us seldom reaches to our waking pitch of happiness the mind often in the midst of its highest visionary satisfactions demands of itself whether it does not owe them to a dream and frequently awakes with the reply  but it is seldom except in cases of the highest delight or the most extreme uneasiness that the mind has power thus to disengage itself from the dominion of fancy in the ordinary course of its operations it submits to those numberless phantastic images that succeed each other and which like many of our waking thoughts are generally forgotten of these however if any by their oddity or their continuance affect us strongly they are then remembered and there have been some who felt their impressions so strongly as to mistake them for realities and to rank them among the past actions of their lives  there are others upon whom dreams seem to have a very different effect and who without seeming to remember their impressions the next morning have yet shown by their actions during sleep that they were very powerfully impelled by their dominion we have numberless instances of such persons who while asleep have performed many of the ordinary duties to which they had been accustomed when waking and with a ridiculous industry have completed by night what they failed doing by day we are told in the german ephemerides of a young student who being enjoined a severe exercise by his tutor went to bed despairing of accomplishing it the next morning awaking to his great surprise he found the task fairly written out and finished in his own handwriting he was at first as the account has it induced to ascribe this strange production to the operations of an infernal agent but his tutor willing to examine the affair to the bottom set him another exercise still more severe than the former and took precautions to observe his conduct the whole night the young gentleman upon being so severely tasked felt the same inquietude that he had done on the former occasion went to bed gloomy and pensive pondering on the next days duty and after some time fell asleep but shortly after his tutor who continued to observe him from a place that was concealed was surprised to see him get up and very deliberately go to the table there he took out pen ink and paper drew himself a chair and sat very methodically to thinking it seems that his being asleep only served to strengthen the powers of his imagination for he very quickly and easily went through the task assigned him put his chair aside and then returned to bed to take out the rest of his nap what credit we are to give to this account i will not pretend to determine but this may be said that the book from whence it is taken has some good marks of veracity for it is very learned and very dull and is written in a country well noted if not for truth at least for want of invention  the ridiculous history of arlotto is well known who has had a volume written containing a narrative of the actions of his life not one of which was performed while he was awake he was an italian franciscan friar extremely rigid in his manners and remarkably devout and learned in his daily conversation by night however and during his sleep he played a very different character from what he did by day and was often detected in very attrocious crimes he was at one time detected in actually attempting a rape and did not awake till the next morning when he was surprised to find himself in the hands of justice his brothers of the convent often watched him while he went very deliberately into the chapel and there attempted to commit sacrilege they sometimes permitted him to carry the chalice and the vestments away into his own chamber and the next morning amused themselves at the poor mans consternation for what he had done but of all his sleeping transgressions that was the most ridiculous in which he was called to pray for the soul of a person departed arlotto after having very devoutly performed his duty retired to a chamber which was shown him to rest but there he had no sooner fallen asleep than he began to reflect that the dead body had got a ring upon one of the fingers which might be useful to him accordingly with a pious resolution of stealing it he went down undressed as he was into a room full of women and with great composure endeavored to seize the ring the consequence was that he was taken before the inquisition for witchcraft and the poor creature had like to have been condemned till his peculiar character accidentally came to be known however he was ordered to remain for the rest of life in his own convent and upon no account whatsoever to stir abroad  what are we to say to such actions as these or how account for this operation of the mind in dreaming it should seem that the imagination by day as well as by night is always employed and that often against our wills it intrudes where it is least commanded or desired while awake and in health this busy principle cannot much delude us it may build castles in the air and raise a thousand phantoms before us but we have every one of the senses alive to bear testimony to its falsehood our eyes show us that the prospect is not present our hearing and our touch depose against its reality and our taste and smelling are equally vigilant in detecting the impostor reason therefore at once gives judgment upon the cause and the vagrant intruder imagination is imprisoned or banished from the mind but in sleep it is otherwise having as much as possible put our senses from their duty having closed the eyes from seeing and the ears taste and smelling from their peculiar functions and having diminished even the touch itself by all the arts of softness the imagination is then left to riot at large and to lead the understanding without an opposer every incursive idea then becomes a reality and the mind not having one power that can prove the illusion takes them for truths as in madness the senses from struggling with the imagination are at length forced to submit so in sleep they seem for a while soothed into the like submission the smallest violence exerted upon any one of them however rouzes all the rest in their mutual defense and the imagination that had for a while told its thousand falsehoods is totally driven away or only permitted to pass under the custody of such as are every moment ready to detect its imposition  chap vii of seeing this chapter is taken from mr buffon i believe the reader will readily excuse any apology and perhaps may wish that i had taken this liberty much more frequently what i add is marked as in a former instance with inverted commas thus  having mentioned the senses as correcting the errors of the imagination and as forcing it in some measure to bring us just information it will naturally follow that we should examine the nature of those senses themselves we shall thus be enabled to see how far they also impose on us and how far they contribute to correct each other let it be observed however that in this we are neither giving a treatise of optics or phonics but an history of our own perceptions and to those we chiefly confine ourselves  the eyes very soon begin to be formed in the human embryo and in the chicken also of all the parts which the animal has double the eyes are produced the soonest and appear the most prominent it is true indeed that in viviparous animals and particularly in man they are not so large in proportion at first as in the oviparous kinds nevertheless they are more speedily developed when they begin to appear than any other parts of the body it is the same with the organ of hearing the little bones that go to compose the internal parts of the ear are entirely formed before the other bones though much larger have acquired any part of their growth or solidity hence it appears that those parts of the body which are furnished with the greatest quantity of nerves are the first in forming thus the brain and the spinal marrow are the first seen begun in the embryo and in general it may be said that wherever the nerves go or send their branches in great numbers there the parts are soonest begun and the most completely finished  if we examine the eyes of a child some hours or even some days after its birth it will be easily discerned that it as yet makes no use of them the humors of the organ not having as yet acquired a sufficient consistence the rays of light strike but confusedly upon the retina or expansion of nerves at the back of the eye it is not till about a month after they are born that children fix them upon objects for before that time they turn them indiscriminately every where without appearing to be affected by any at six or seven weeks old they plainly discover a choice in the objects of their attention they fix their eyes upon the most brilliant colors and seem peculiarly desirous of turning them toward the light hitherto however they only seem to fortify the organ for seeing distinctly but they have still many illusions to correct  the first great error in vision is that the eye inverts every object and it in reality appears to the child until the touch has served to undeceive it turned upside down a second error in vision is that every object appears double the same object forms itself distinctly upon each eye and is consequently seen twice this error also can only be corrected by the touch and although in reality every object we see appears inverted and double yet the judgment and habit have so often corrected the sense that we no longer submit to its imposition but see every object in its just position the very instant it appears were we therefore deprived of feeling our eyes would not only misrepresent the situation but also the number of all things round us  to convince us that we see objects inverted we have only to observe the manner in which images are represented coming through a small hole in a darkened room if such a small hole be made in a dark room so that no light can come in but through that all the objects without will be painted on the wall behind but in an inverted position their heads downwards for as all the rays which pass from the different parts of the object without cannot enter the hole in the same extent which they had in leaving the object since if so they would require the apperture to be as large as the object and as each part and every point of the object sends forth the image of itself on every side and the rays which form these images pass from all points of the object as from so many centres so such only can pass through the small apperture as come in opposite directions thus the little apperture becomes a center for the entire object through which the rays from the upper parts as well as from the lower parts of it pass in converging directions and consequently they must cross each other in the central point and thus paint the objects behind upon the wall in an inverted position  it is in like manner easy to conceive that we see all objects double whatever our present sensations may seem to tell us to the contrary for to convince us of this we have only to compare the situation of any one object on shutting one eye and then compare the same situation by shutting the other if for instance we hold up a finger and shut the right eye we shall find it hide a certain part of the room if again reshutting the other eye we shall find that part of the room visible and the finger seeming to cover a part of the room that had been visible before if we open both eyes however the part covered will appear to lie between the two extremes but the truth is we see the object our finger had covered one image of it to the right and the other to the left but from habit suppose that we see but one image placed between both our sense of feeling having corrected the errors of sight and thus also if instead of two eyes we had two hundred we should at first fancy the objects increased in proportion until one sense had corrected the errors of another  the having two eyes might thus be said to be rather an inconvenience than a benefit since one eye would answer the purposes of sight as well and be less liable to illusion but it is otherwise two eyes greatly contribute if not to distinct at least to extensive vision lenoardo da vinci  when an object is placed at a moderate distance by the means of both eyes we see a larger share of it than we possibly could with one the right eye seeing a greater portion of its right side and the left eye of its correspondent side thus both eyes in some measure see round the object and it is this that gives it in nature that bold relievo or swelling with which they appear and which no painting how exquisite soever can attain to the painter must be contented with shading on a flat surface but the eyes in observing nature do not behold the shading only but a part of the figure also that lies behind those very shadings which gives it that swelling which painters so ardently desire but can never fully imitate there is another defect which either of the eyes taken singly would have but which is corrected by having the organ double in either eye there is a point which has no vision whatsoever so that if one of them only is employed in seeing there is a part of the object to which it is always totally blind this is that part of the optic nerve where its vein and artery run which being insensible that point of the object that is painted there must continue unseen to be convinced of this we have only to try a very easy experiment if we take three black patches and stick them upon a white wall about a foot distant from each other each about as high as the eye that is to observe them then retiring six or seven feet back and shutting one eye by trying for some time we shall find that while we distinctly behold the black spots that are to the right and left that which is in the middle remains totally unseen or in other words when we bring that part of the eye where the optic artery runs to fall upon the object it will then become invisible this defect however in either eye is always corrected by both since the part of the object that is unseen by one will be very distinctly perceived by the other    beside the former defects we can have no idea of distances from the sight without the help of touch naturally every object we see appears to be within our eyes and a child who has as yet made but little use of the sense of feeling must suppose that every thing it sees makes a part of itself such objects are only seen more or less bulky as they approach or recede from its eyes so that a fly that is near will appear larger than an ox at a distance it is experience alone that can rectify this mistake and a long acquaintance with the real size of every object quickly assures us of the distance at which it is seen the last man in a file of soldiers appears in reality much less perhaps ten times more diminutive than the man next to us however we do not perceive this difference but continue to think him of equal stature for the numbers we have seen thus lessened by distance and have found by repeated experience to be of the natural size when we come closer instantly corrects the sense and every object is perceived with nearly its natural proportion but it is otherwise if we observe objects in such situations as we have not had sufficient experience to correct the errors of the eye if for instance we look at men from the top of an high steeple they in that case appear very much diminished as we have not had an habit of correcting the sense in that position  although a small degree of reflection will serve to convince us of the truth of these positions it may not be amiss to strengthen them by an authority which cannot be disputed mr cheselden having couched a boy of thirteen for a cataract who had hitherto been blind and thus at once having restored him to sight curiously marked the progress of his mind upon that occasion this youth though he had been till then incapable of seeing yet was not totally blind but could tell day from night as persons in his situation always may he could also with a strong light distinguish black from white and either from the vivid color of scarlet however he saw nothing of the form of bodies and without a bright light not even colors themselves he was at first couched only in one of his eyes and when he saw for the first time he was so far from judging of distances that he supposed that his eyes touched every object that he saw in the same manner as his hands might be said to feel them the objects that were most agreeable to him were such as were of plain surfaces and regular figures though he could as yet make no judgment whatever of their different forms nor give a reason why one pleased him more than another although he could form some idea of colors during his state of blindness yet that was not sufficient to direct him at present and he could scarcely be persuaded that the colors he now saw were the same with those he had formerly conceived such erroneous ideas of he delighted most in green but black objects as if giving him an idea of his former blindness he regarded with horror he had as was said no idea of forms and was unable to distinguish one object from another though never so different when those things were shown him which he had been formerly familiarized to by his feeling he beheld them with earnestness in order to remember them a second time but as he had too many to recollect at once he forgot the greatest number and for one he could tell after seeing there was a thousand he was totally unacquainted with he was very much much surprised to find that these things and persons he loved best were not the most beautiful to be seen and even testified displeasure in not finding his parents so handsome as he conceived them to be it was near two months before he could find that a picture resembled a solid body till then he only considered it as a flat surface variously shadowed but when he began to perceive that these kind of shadings actually represented human beings he then began to examine by his touch whether they had not the usual qualities of such bodies and was greatly surprised to find what he expected a very unequal surface to be smooth and even he was then shown a miniature picture of his father which was contained in his mothers watchcase and he readily perceived the resemblance but asked with great astonishment how so large a face could be contained in so small a compass it seemed as strange to him as if a bushel was contained in a pint vessel at first he could bear but a very small quantity of light and he saw every object much greater than the life but in proportion as he saw objects that were really large he seemed to think the former were diminished and although he knew the chamber where he was contained in the house yet until he saw the latter he could not be brought to conceive how an house could be larger than a chamber before the operation he had no great expectations from the pleasure he should receive from a new sense he was only excited by the hopes of being able to read and write he said for instance that he could have no greater pleasure in walking in the garden with his sight than he had without it for he walked there at his ease and was acquainted with all the walks he remarked also with great justice that his former blindness gave him one advantage over the rest of mankind which was that of being able to walk in the night with confidence and security but when he began to make use of his new sense he seemed transported beyond measure he said that every new object was a new source of delight and that his pleasure was so great as to be past expression about a year after he was brought to epsom where there is a very fine prospect with which he seemed greatly charmed and he called the landscape before him a new method of seeing he was couched in the other eye a year after the former and the operation succeeded equally well when he saw with both eyes he said that objects appeared to him twice as large as when he saw but with one however he did not see them doubled or at least he showed no marks as if he saw them so mr cheselden mentions instances of many more that were restored to sight in this manner they all seemed to concur in their perceptions with this youth and they all seemed particularly embarrassed in learning how to direct their eyes to the objects they wished to observe  in this manner it is that our feeling corrects the sense of seeing and that objects which appear of very different sizes at different distances are all reduced by experience to their natural standard but not the feeling only but also the color and brightness of the object contributes in some measure to assist us in forming an idea of the distance at which it appears mr buffon gives a different theory for which i must refer the reader to the original that i have given i take to be easy and satisfactory enough  those which we see most strongly marked with light and shade we readily know to be nearer than those on which the colors are more faintly spread and that in some measure take a part of their hue from the air between us and them bright objects also are seen at a greater distance than such as are obscure and most probably for this reason that being less similar in color to the air which interposes their impressions are less effaced by it and they continue more distinctly visible thus a black and distant object is not seen so far off as a bright and glittering one and a fire by night is seen much farther off than by day  the power of seeing objects at a distance is very rarely equal in both eyes when this inequality is in any great degree the person so circumstanced then makes use only of one eye shutting that which sees the least and employing the other with all its power and hence proceeds that awkward look which is known by the name of strabism  there are many reasons to induce us to think that such as are near sighted see objects larger than other persons and yet the contrary is most certainly true for they see them less mr buffon informs us that he himself is short sighted and that his left eye is stronger than his right he has very frequently experienced upon looking at any object such as the letters of a book that they appear less to the weakest eye and that when he places the book so as that the letters appear double the images of the left eye which is strongest are greater than those of the right which is the most feeble he has examined several others who were in similar circumstances and has always found that the best eye saw every object the largest this he ascribes to habit for near sighted people being accustomed to come close to the object and view but a small part of it at a time the habit ensues when the whole of an object is seen and it appears less to them than to others  infants having their eyes less than those of adults must see objects also smaller in proportion for the image formed on the back of the eye will be large as the eye is capacious and infants having it not so great cannot have so large a picture of the object this may be a reason also why they are unable to see so distinctly or at such distances as persons arrived at maturity  old men on the contrary see bodies close to them very indistinctly but bodies at a great distance from them with more precision and this may happen from an alteration in the coats or perhaps humors of the eye and not as is supposed from their dimunition the cornea for instance may become too rigid to adapt itself and take a proper convexity for seeing minute objects and its very flatness will be sufficient to fit it for distant vision  when we cast our eyes upon an object extremely brilliant or when we fix and detain them too long upon the same object the organ is hurt and fatigued its vision becomes indistinct and the image of the body which has thus too violently or too perseveringly employed us is painted upon every thing we look at and mixes with every object that occurs and this is an obvious consequence of the eye taking in too much light either immediately or by reflection every body whatsoever that is exposed to the light for a time drinks in a quantity of its rays which being brought into darkness it cannot instantly discharge thus the hand if it be exposed to broad day light for some time and then immediately snatched into a dark room will appear still luminous and it will be some time before it is totally darkened it is thus with the eye which either by an instant gaze at the sun or a steady continuance upon some less brilliant object has taken in too much light its humors are for a while unfit for vision until that be discharged and room made for rays of a milder nature how dangerous the looking upon bright and luminous objects is to the sight may be easily seen from such as live in countries covered for most part of the year with snow who become generally blind before their time travelers themselves who cross these countries are obliged to wear a crape before their eyes to save their eyes which would otherwise be rendered totally unserviceable and it is equally dangerous in the sandy plains of africa the reflection of the light is there so strong that it is impossible to sustain the effect without incurring the danger of losing ones sight entirely such persons therefore as read or write for any continuance should choose a moderate light in order to save their eyes and although it may seem insufficient at first the eye will accustom itself to the shade by degrees and be less hurt by the want of light than the excess  it is indeed surprising how far the eye can accommodate itself to darkness and make the best of a gloomy situation when first taken from the light and brought into a dark room all things disappear or if any thing is seen it is only the remaining radiations that still continue in the eye but after a very little time when these are spent the eye takes the advantage of the smallest ray that happens to enter and this alone would in time serve for many of the purposes of life there was a gentleman of great courage and understanding as we are told by boil who wasa major under king charles the first this unfortunate man sharing in his masters misfortunes and being forced abroad ventured at madrid to do his king a signal service but unluckily failed in the attempt in consequence of this he was instantly ordered to a dark and dismal dungeon into which the light never entered and into which there was no opening but by an hole at the top down which the keeper put his provisions and presently closed it again on the other side in this manner the unfortunate loyalist continued for some weeks distressed and disconsolate but at last began to think he saw some little glimmering of light this internal dawn seemed to increase from time to time so that he could not only discover the parts of his bed and such other large objects but at length he even began to perceive the mice that frequented his cell and saw them as they ran about the floor eating the crumbs of bread that happened to fall after some months confinement he was at last set free but such was the effect of the darkness upon him that he could not for some days venture to leave his dungeon but was obliged to accustom himself by degrees to the light of the day  chap viii of hearing this chapter is taken from mr buffon except where marked by inverted commas  as the sense of hearing as well as of sight gives us notice of remote objects so like that it is subject to similar errors being capable of imposing on us upon all occasions where we cannot rectify it by the sense of feeling we can have from it no distinct intelligence of the distance from whence a sounding body is heard a great noise far off and a small one very near produce the same sensation and unless we receive information from some other sense we can never distinctly tell whether the sound be a great or a small one it is not till we have learned by experience that the particular sound which is heard is of a peculiar kind then we can judge of the distance from whence we hear it when we know the tone of the bell we can then judge how far it is from us  every body that strikes against another produces a sound which is simple and but one in bodies which are not elastic but which is often repeated in such as are if we strike a bell or a stretched string for instance which are both elastic a single blow produces a sound which is repeated by the undulations of the sonorous body and which is multiplied as often as it happens to undulate or vibrate these undulations each strike their own peculiar blow but they succeed so fast one behind the other that the ear supposes them one continued sound whereas in reality they make many a person who should for the first time hear the toll of the bell would very probably be able to distinguish these breaks of sound and in fact we can readily ourselves perceive an intension and remission in the sound  in this manner sounding bodies are of two kinds those unelastic ones which being struck return but a single sound and those more elastic returning a succession of sounds which uniting together form a tone this tone may be considered as a great number of sounds all produced one after the other by the same body as we find in a bell or the string of an harpsichord which continues to sound for some time after it is struck a continuing tone may be also produced from a nonelastic body by repeating the blow quick and often as when we beat a drum or when we draw a bow along the string of a fiddle  considering the subject in this light if we should multiply the number of blows or repeat them at quicker intervals upon the sounding body as upon the drum for instance it is evident that this will have no effect in altering the tone it will only make it either more even or more distinct but it is otherwise if we increase the force of the blow if we strike the body with double weight this will produce a tone twice as loud as the former if for instance i strike a table with a switch this will be very different from the sound produced by striking it with a cudgel from hence therefore we may infer that all bodies give a louder and graver tone not in proportion to the number of times they are struck but in proportion to the force that strikes them and if this be so those philosophers who make the tone of a sonorous body of a bell or the string of an harpsichord for instance to depend upon the number only of its vibrations and not the force have mistaken what is only an effect for a cause a bell or an elastic string can only be considered as a drum beaten and the frequency of the blows can make no alteration whatsoever in the tone the largest bells and the longest and thickest strings have the most forceful vibrations and therefore their tones are the most loud and the most grave  to know the manner in which sounds thus produced become pleasing it must be observed no one continuing tone how loud or swelling soever can give us satisfaction we must have a succession of them and those in the most pleasing proportion the nature of this proportion may be thus conceived if we strike a body incapable of vibration with a double force or what amounts to the same thing with a double mass of matter it will produce a sound that will be doubly grave music has been said by the ancients to have been first invented from the blows of different hammers on an anvil suppose then we strike an anvil with an hammer of one pound weight and again with an hammer of two pounds it is plain that the two pound hammer will produce a sound twice as grave as the former but if we strike with a two pound hammer and then with a three pound it is evident that the latter will produce a sound one third more grave than the former if we strike the anvil with a three pound hammer and then with a four pound it will likewise follow that the latter will be a quarter part more grave than the former now in the comparing between all those sounds it is obvious that the difference between one and two is more easily perceived than between two and three three and four or any numbers succeeding in the same proportion the succession of sounds will be therefore pleasing in proportion to the ease with which they may be distinguished that sound which is double the former or in other words the octave to the preceding tone will of all others be the most pleasing harmony the next to that which is as two to three or in other words the third will be most agreeable and thus universally those sounds whose differences may be most easily compared are the most agreeable  musicians therefore have contented themselves with seven different proportions of sound which are called notes and which sufficiently answer all the purposes of pleasure not but that they might adopt a greater diversity of proportions and some have actually done so but in these the differences of the proportion are so imperceptible that the ear is rather fatigued than pleased in making the distinction in order however to give variety they have admitted half tones but in all the countries where music is yet in its infancy they have rejected such and they can find music in none but the obvious ones the chinese for instance have neither flats nor sharps in their music but the intervals between their other notes are in the same proportion with ours many more barbarous nations have their peculiar instruments of music and what is remarkable the proportion between their notes is in all the same as in ours this is not the place for entering into the nature of these sounds their effects upon the air or their consonances with each other we are not now giving an history of sound but of human perception  all countries are pleased with music and if they have not skill enough to produce harmony at least they seem willing to substitute noise without all question noise alone is sufficient to operate powerfully on the spirits and if the mind be already predisposed to joy i have seldom found noise fail of increasing it into rapture the mind feels a kind of distracted pleasure in such powerful sounds braces up every nerve and riots in the excess but as in the eye an immediate gaze upon the sun will disturb the organ so in the ear a loud unexpected noise disorders the whole frame and sometimes disturbs the sense ever after the mind must have time to prepare for the expected shock and to give its organs the proper tension for its arrival  musical sounds however seem of a different kind these are generally most pleasing which are most unexpected it is not from bracing up the nerves but from the grateful succession of the sounds that these become so charming there are few how indifferent soever but have at times felt their pleasing impression and perhaps even those who have stood out against the powerful persuasion of sounds only wanted the proper tune or the proper instrument to allure them  the ancients give us a thousand strange instances of the effects of music upon men and animals the story of arions harp that gathered the dolphins to the ship side is well known and what is remarkable schotteus assures us quod occulis meis spectavi schotti magic universalis pars ii l   p     that he saw a similar instance of fishes being allured by music himself they tell us of diseases that have been cured unchastity corrected seditions quelled passions removed and sometimes excited even to madness doctor wallis has endeavored to account for these surprising effects by ascribing them to the novelty of the art for my own part i can scarce hesitate to impute them to the exaggeration of their writers they are as hyperbolical in the effects of their oratory and yet we well know there is nothing in the orations which they have left us capable of exciting madness or of raising the mind to that ungovernable degree of fury which they describe as they have exaggerated therefore in one instance we may naturally suppose that they have done the same in the other and indeed from the few remains we have of their music collected by meibomius one might be apt to suppose there was nothing very powerful in what is lost nor does any one of the ancient instruments such as we see them represented in statues appear comparable to our fiddle  however this be we have many odd accounts not only among them but the moderns of the power of music and it must not be denied but that on some particular occasions musical sounds may have a very powerful effect i have seen all the horses and cows in a field where there were above an hundred gather round a person that was blowing the french horn and seeming to testify an awkward kind of satisfaction dogs are well known to be very sensible of different tones in music and i have sometimes heard them sustain a very ridiculous part in a concert where their assistance was neither expected nor desired  we are told olaij magni l    hist c     of henry iv of denmark that being one day desirous of trying in person whether a musician who boasted that he could excite men to madness was not an impostor he submitted to the operation of his skill but the consequence was much more terrible than he expected for becoming actually mad he killed four of his attendants in the midst of his transports a contrary effect of music we have hist de laccad   0  p     in the cure of a madman of alais in france by music this man who was a dancing master after a fever of five days grew furious and so ungovernable that his hands were obliged to be tied to his sides what at first was rage in a short time was converted into silent melancholy which no arts could exhilerate nor no medicines remove in this sullen and dejected state an old acquaintance accidentally came to enquire after his health he found him sitting up in bed tied and totally regardless of every external object round him happening however to take up a fiddle that lay in the room and touching a favorite air the poor madman instantly seemed to brighten up at the sound from a recumbent posture he began to sit up and as the musician continued playing the patient seemed desirous of dancing to the sound but he was tied and incapable of leaving his bed so that he could only humor the tune with his head and that part of his arms which were at liberty thus the other continued playing and the dancing master practiced his own art as far as he was able for about a quarter of an hour when suddenly falling into a deep sleep in which his disorder came to a crisis he awaked perfectly recovered  a thousand other instances might be added equally true let it suffice to add one more which is not true i mean that of the tarantula every person who has been in italy now well knows that the bite of this animal and its being cured by music is all a deception when strangers come into that part of the country the country people are ready enough to take money for dancing to the tarantula a friend of mine had a servant who suffered himself to be bit the wound which was little larger than the puncture of a pin was uneasy for a few hours and then became well without any farther assistance some of the country people however still make a tolerable livelihood of the credulity of strangers as the musician finds his account in it not less than the dancer    sounds like light are not only extensively diffused but are frequently reflected the laws of this reflection it is true are not as well understood as those of light all we know is that sound is principally reflected by hard bodies and their being hollow also sometimes increases the reverberation no art however can make an echo and some who have bestowed great labor and expense upon such a project have only erected shapeless buildings whose silence was a mortifying lecture upon their presumption  the internal cavity of the ear seems to be fitted up for the purposes of ecchoing sound with the greatest precision this part is fashioned out in the temporal bone like a cavern cut into a rock in this the sound is repeated and articulated and as some anatomists tell us for we have as yet but very little knowledge on this subject is beaten against the tympanum or drum of the ear which moves four little bones joined thereto and these move and agitate the internal air which lies on the other side and lastly this air strikes and affects the auditory nerves which carry the sound to the brain  one of the most common disorders in old age is deafness which probably proceeds from the rigidity of the nerves in the labyrinth of the ear this disorder also sometimes proceeds from a stoppage of the wax which art may easily remedy in order to know whether the defect be an internal or an external one let the deaf person put a repeating watch into his mouth and if he hears it strike he may be assured that his disorder proceeds from an external cause and is in some measure curable for there is a passage from the ears into the mouth by what anatomists call the eustachian tube and by this passage people often hear sounds when they are utterly without hearing through the larger channel and this also is the reason that we often see persons who listen with great attention hearken with their mouths open in order to catch all the sound at every apperture  it often happens that persons hear differently with one ear from the other and it is generally found that these have what is called by musicians a bad ear mr buffon who has made many trials upon persons of this kind always found that their defect in judging properly of sounds proceeded from the inequality of their ears and receiving by both at the same time unequal sensations they form an unjust idea in this manner as those people hear false they also without knowing it sing false those persons also frequently deceive themselves with regard to the side from whence the sound comes generally supposing the noise to come on the part of the best ear  such as are hard of hearing find the same advantage in the trumpet made for this purpose that shortsighted persons do from glasses these trumpets might be easily enlarged so as to increase sounds in the same manner that the telescope does bodies however they could be used to advantage only in a place of solitude and stillness as the neighboring sounds would mix with the more distant and the whole would produce in the ear nothing but tumult and confusion  hearing is a much more necessary sense to man than to animals with these it is only a warning against danger or an encouragement to mutual assistance in man it is the source of most of his pleasures and without which the rest of his senses would be of little benefit a man born deaf must necessarily be dumb and his whole sphere of knowledge must be bounded only by sensual objects we have an instance of a young man who being born deaf was restored at the age of twentyfour to perfect hearing the account is given in the memoirs of the academy of sciences   0  page     a young man of the town of chartres between the age of twentythree and twentyfour the son of a tradesman and deaf and dumb from his birth began to speak all of a sudden to the great astonishment of the whole town he gave them to understand that about three or four months before he had heard the sound of the bells for the first time and was greatly surprised at this new and unknown sensation after some time a kind of water issued from his left ear and he then heard perfectly well with both during these three months he was sedulously employed in listening without saying a word and accustoming himself to speak softly so as not to be heard the words pronounced by others he labored hard also in perfecting himself in the pronunciation and in the ideas attached to every sound at length having supposed himself qualified to break silence he declared that he could now speak although as yet but imperfectly soon after some able divines questioned him concerning his ideas of his past state and principally with respect to god his soul the morality or turpitude of actions the young man however had not driven his solitary speculations into that channel he had gone to mass indeed with his parents had learned to sign himself with the cross to kneel down and assume all the grimaces of a man that was praying but he did all this without any manner of knowledge of the intention or the cause he saw others do the like and that was enough for him he knew nothing even of death and it never entered into his head he led a life of pure animal instinct entirely taken up with sensible objects and such as were present he did not seem even to make as many reflections upon these as might reasonably be expected from his improving situation and yet the young man was not in want of understanding but the understanding of a man deprived of all commerce with others is so very confined that the mind is in some measure totally under the control of its immediate sensations  notwithstanding it is very possible to communicate ideas to deaf men which they previously wanted and even give them very precise notions of some abstract subjects by means of signs and of letters a person born deaf may by time and sufficient pains be taught to write and read to speak and by the motions of the lips to understand what is said to him however it is probable that as most of the motions of speech are made within the mouth by the tongue the knowledge from the motion of the lips is but very confined nevertheless i have conversed with a gentleman thus taught and in all the commonly occurring questions and the usual salutations he was ready enough merely by attending to the motion of the lips alone when i ventured to speak for a short continuance he was totally at a loss although he understood the subject when written extremely well persons taught in this manner were at first considered as prodigies but there have been so many instances of success of late and so many are skilful in the art of instructing in this way that though still a matter of some curiosity it ceases to be an object of wonder  chap ix of smelling feeling and tasting an animal may be said to fill up that sphere which he can reach by his senses and is actually large in proportion to the sphere to which its organ extends by sight mans enjoyments are diffused into a wide circle that of hearing though less widely diffused nevertheless extends his powers the sense of smelling is more contracted still and the taste and touch are the most confined of all thus man enjoys very distant objects but with one sense only more nearly he brings two senses at once to bear upon them his sense of smelling assists the other two at its own distance and of such objects as a man he may be said to be in perfect possession  each sense however the more it acts at a distance the more capable it is of making combinations and is consequently the more improveable refined imaginations and men of strong minds take more pleasure therefore in improving the delights of the distant senses than in enjoying such as are scarce capable of improvement  by combining the objects of the extensive senses all the arts of poetry painting and harmony have been discovered but the closer senses if i may so call them such as smelling tasting and touching are in some measure as simple as they are limited and admit of little variety the man of imagination makes a great and an artificial happiness by the pleasure of altering and combining the sensualist just stops where he began and cultivates only those pleasures which he cannot improve the sensualist is contented with those enjoyments that are already made to his hand but the man of pleasure is best pleased with growing happiness  of all the senses perhaps there is not one in which man is more inferior to other animals than in that of smelling with man it is a sense that acts in a narrow sphere and disgusts almost as frequently as it gives him pleasure with many other animals it is diffused to a very great extent and never seems to offend them dogs not only trace the steps of other animals but also discover them by the scent at a very great distance and while they are thus exquisitely sensible of all smells they seem no way disgusted by any  but although this sense is in general so very inferior in man it is much stronger in those nations that abstain from animal food than among us of europe the bramins of india have a power of smelling as i am informed equal to what it is in most other creatures they can smell the water which they drink that to us seems quite inodorous and have a word in their language which denotes a country of fine water we are told also that the negroes of the antilles by the smell alone can distinguish between the footsteps of a frenchman and a negro it is possible therefore that we may dull this organ by our luxurious way of living and sacrifice to the pleasures of taste those which might be received from perfume  however it is a sense that we can in some measure dispense with and i have known many that wanted it entirely with but very little inconvenience from its loss in a state of nature it is said to be useful to us in guiding us to proper nourishment and deterring us from that which is unwholesome but in our present situation such information is but little wanted and indeed but little attended to in fact the sense of smelling gives us very often false intelligence many things that have a disagreeable odor are nevertheless wholesome and pleasant to the taste and such as make eating an art seldom think a meal fit to please the appetite till it begins to offend the nose on the other hand there are many things that smell most gratefully and yet are noxious or fatal to the constitution some physicians think that all perfumes in general are unwholesome that they relax the nerves produce head aches and even retard digestion the machinel apple which is known to be deadly poison is possessed of the most grateful odor some of those mineral vapors that are often found fatal in the stomach smell like the sweetest flowers and continue thus to flatter till they destroy this sense therefore as it should seem was never meant to direct us in the choice of food but appears rather as an attendant than a necessary pleasure  indeed if we examine the natives of different countries or even different natives of the same we shall find no pleasure in which they differ so widely as that of smelling some persons are pleased with the smell of a rose while i have known others that could not abide to have it approach them the savage nations are highly delighted with the smell of assafoetida which is to us the most nauseous stink in nature it would in a manner seem that our delight in perfumes was made by habit and that a very little industry could bring us totally to invert the perception of odours  thus much is certain that many bodies which at one distance are an agreeable perfume when nearer are a most ungrateful odor musk and ambergrease in small quantities are considered by most persons as highly fragrant and yet when in larger masses their scent is insufferable from a mixture of two bodies each whereof is of itself void of all smell a very powerful smell may be drawn thus by grinding quick lime with salammoniac may be produced a very foetid mixture on the contrary from a mixture of two bodies that are separately disagreeable a very pleasant aromatic odor may be gained a mixture of aqua fortis with spirit of wine produces this effect but not only the alterations of bodies by each other but the smallest change in us makes a very great alteration in this sense and frequently deprives us of it totally a slight cold often hinders us from smelling and as often changes the nature of odours some persons from disorder retain an incurable aversion to those smells which most pleased them before and many have been known to have an antipathy to some animals whose presence they instantly perceive by the smell from all this therefore the sense of smelling appears to be an uncertain monitor easily disordered and not much missed when totally wanting  the sense most nearly allied to smelling is that of tasting this some have been willing to consider merely as a nicer kind of touch and have undertaken to account in a very mechanical manner for the difference of savours such bodies said they as are pointed happening to be applied to the papillae of the tongue excite a very powerful sensation and give us the idea of saltness such on the contrary as are of a rounder figure slide smoothly along the papillae and are perceived to be sweet in this manner they have with minute labor gone through the variety of imagined forms in bodies and have given them as imaginary effects all we can precisely determine upon the nature of tastes is that the bodies to be tasted must be either somewhat moistened or in some measure dissolved by the saliva before they can produce a proper sensation when both the tongue itself and the body to be tasted are extremely dry no taste whatever ensues the sensation is then changed and the tongue instead of tasting can only be said like any other part of the body to feel the object  it is for this reason that children have a stronger relish of tastes than those who are more advanced in life this organ with them from the greater moisture of their bodies is kept in greater perfection and is consequently better adapted to perform its functions every person remembers how great a pleasure he found in sweets while a child but his taste growing more obtuse with age he is obliged to use artificial means to excite it it is then that he is found to call in the assistance of poignant sauces and strong relishes of salts and aromatics all which the delicacy of his tender organ in childhood were unable to endure his taste grows callous to the natural relishes and is artificially formed to others more unnatural so that the highest epicure may be said to have the most depraved taste as it is owing to the bluntness of his organs that he is obliged to have recourse to such a variety of expedients to gratify his appetite  as smells are often rendered agreeable by habit so also tastes may be tobacco and coffee so pleasing to many are yet at first very disagreeable to all it is not without perseverance that we begin to have a relish for them we force nature so long that what was constraint in the beginning at last becomes inclination  the grossest and yet the most useful of all the senses is that of feeling we are often seen to survive under the loss of the rest but of this we can never be totally deprived but with life although this sense is diffused over all parts of the body yet it most frequently happens that those parts which are most exercised in touching acquire the greatest degree of accuracy thus the fingers by long habit become greater masters in the art than any others even where the sensation is more delicate and fine buffon vol vi p  0  it is from this habit therefore and their peculiar formation and not as is supposed from their being furnished with a greater quantity of nerves that the fingers are thus perfectly qualified to judge of forms blind men who are obliged to use them much oftener than we have this sense much finer so that the delicacy of the touch arises rather from the habit of constantly employing the fingers than from any fancied nervousness in their conformation  all animals that are furnished with hands buffon vol vi p     seem to have more understanding than others monkeys have so many actions like those of men that they appear to have similar ideas of the form of bodies all other creatures deprived of hands can have no distinct ideas of the shape of the objects by which they are surrounded as they want this organ which serves to examine and measure their forms their risings and depressions a quadrupede probably conceives as erroneous an idea of any thing near him as a child would of a rock or a mountain that it beheld at a distance it may be for this reason that we often see them frighted at things with which they ought to be better acquainted fishes whose bodies are covered with scales and who have no organs for feeling must be the most stupid of all animals serpents that are likewise destitute are yet by winding round several bodies better capable of judging of their form all these however can have but very imperfect ideas from feeling and we have already seen when deprived of this sense how little the rest of the senses are to be relied on  the feeling therefore is the guardian the judge and the examiner of all the rest of the senses it establishes their information and detects their errors all the other senses are altered by time and contradict their former evidence but the touch still continues the same and though extremely confined in its operations yet it is never found to deceive the universe to a man who had only used the rest of his senses would be but a scene of illusion every object misrepresented and all its properties unknown mr buffon has imagined a man just newly brought into existence describing the illusion of his first sensations and pointing out the steps by which he arrived at reality he considers him as just created and awaking amidst the productions of nature and to animate the narrative still more strongly has made his philosophical man a speaker the reader will no doubt recollect adams speech in milton as being similar all that i can say to obviate the imputation of plagiarism is that the one treats the subject more as a poet the other more as a philosopher the philosophers man describes his first sensations in the following manner buffon vol vi p      i well remember that joyful anxious moment when i first became acquainted with my own existence i was quite ignorant of what i was how i was produced or from whence i came i opened my eyes what an addition to my surprise the light of the day the azure vault of heaven the verdure of the earth the crystal of the waters all employed me at once and animated and filled me with inexpressible delight i at first imagined that all those objects were within me and made a part of myself  impressed with this idea i turned my eyes to the sun its splendour dazzled and overpowered me i shut them once more and to my great concern i supposed that during this short interval of darkness i was again returning to nothing  afflicted seized with astonishment i pondered a moment on this great change when i heard a variety of unexpected sounds the whistling of the wind and the melody of the grove formed a concert the soft cadence of which sunk upon my soul i listened for some time and was persuaded that all this music was within me  quite occupied with this new kind of existence i had already forgotten the light which was my first inlet into life when i once more opened my eyes and found myself again in possession of my former happiness the gratification of the two senses at once was a pleasure too great for utterance  i turned my eyes upon a thousand various objects i soon found that i could lose them and restore them at will and amused myself more at leisure with a repetition of this newmade power  i now began to gaze without emotion and to hearken with tranquillity when a light breeze the freshness of which charmed me wafted its perfumes to my sense of smelling and gave me such satisfaction as even increased my selflove  agitated rouzed by the various pleasures of my new existence i instantly arose and perceived myself moved along as if by some unknown and secret power  i had scarce proceeded forward when the novelty of my situation once more rendered me immovable my surprise returned i supposed that every object around me had been in motion i gave to them that agitation which i produced by changing place and the whole creation seemed once more in disorder  i lifted my hand to my head i touched my forehead i felt my whole frame i then supposed that my hand was the principal organ of my existence all its informations were distinct and perfect and so superior to the senses i had yet experienced that i employed myself for some time in repeating its enjoyments every part of my person i touched seemed to touch my hand in turn and gave back sensation for sensation  i soon found that this faculty was expanded over the whole surface of my body and i now first began to perceive the limits of my existence which i had in the beginning supposed spread over all the objects i saw  upon casting my eyes upon my body and surveying my own form i thought it greater than all the objects that surrounded me i gazed upon my person with pleasure i examined the formation of my hand and all its motions it seemed to me large or little in proportion as i approached it to my eyes i brought it very near and it then hid almost every other object from my sight i began soon however to find that my sight gave me uncertain information and resolved to depend upon my feeling for redress  this precaution was of the utmost service i renewed my motions and walked forward with my face turned toward the heavens i happened to strike lightly against a palm tree and this renewed my surprise i laid my hand on this strange body it seemed replete with new wonders for it did not return me sensation for sensation as my former feelings had done i now therefore perceived that there was something external and which did not make a part of my own existence  i now therefore resolved to touch whatever i saw and vainly attempted to touch the sun i stretched forth my arm and felt only yielding air at every effort i fell from one surprise into another for every object appeared equally near me and it was not till after an infinity of trials that i found some objects further removed than the rest  amazed with the illusions and the uncertainty of my state i sat down beneath a tree the most beautiful fruits hung upon it within my reach i stretched forth my hand and they instantly separated from the branch i was proud of being able to grasp a substance without me i held them up and their weight appeared to me like an animated power that endeavored to draw them to the earth i found a pleasure in conquering their resistance  i held them near my eye i considered their form and beauty their fragrance still more allured me to bring them nearer i approached them to my lips and drank in their odours the perfume invited my sense of tasting and i soon tried a new sense  how new how exquisite hitherto i had tasted only of pleasure but now it was luxury the power of tasting gave me the idea of possession  flattered with this new acquisition i continued its exercise till an agreeable languor stealing upon my mind i felt all my limbs become heavy and all my desires suspended my sensations were now no longer vivid and distinct but seemed to lose every object and presented only feeble images confusedly marked at that instant i sunk upon the flowery bank and slumber seized me all now seemed once more lost to me it was then as if i was returning into my former nothing how long my sleep continued i cannot tell as i yet had no perception of time my awaking appeared like a second birth and i then perceived that i had ceased for a time to exist this produced a new sensation of fear and from this interruption in life i began to conclude that i was not formed to exist for ever  in this state of doubt and perplexity i began to harbor new suspicions and to fear that sleep had robbed me of some of my late powers when turning on one side to resolve my doubts what was my amazement to behold another being like myself stretched by my side new ideas now began to arise new passions as yet unperceived with fears and pleasures all took possession of my mind and prompted my curiosity love served to complete that happiness which was begun in the individual and every sense was gratified in all its varieties  chap x of old age and death this chapter is taken from mr buffon except where it is marked by inverted commas  every thing in nature has its improvement and decay the human form is no sooner arrived at its state of perfection than it begins to decline the alteration is at first insensible and often several years are elapsed before we find ourselves grown old the news of this disagreeable change too generally comes from without and we learn from others that we grow old before we are willing to believe the report  when the body has come to its full height and is extended into its just dimensions it then also begins to receive an additional bulk which rather loads than assists it this is formed from fat which generally at the age of thirtyfive or forty covers all the muscles and interrupts their activity every action is then performed with greater labor and the increase of size only serves as a forerunner of decay  the bones also become every day more solid in the embryo they are as soft almost as the muscles and the flesh but by degrees they harden and acquire their natural vigor but still however the circulation is carried on through them and how hard soever the bones may seem yet the blood holds its current through them as through all other parts of the body of this we may be convinced by an experiment which was first accidentally discovered by our ingenious countryman mr belcher perceiving at a friends house that the bones of hogs which were fed upon madder were red he tried it upon various animals by mixing this root with their usual food and he found that it tinctured the bones in all an evident demonstration that the juices of the body had a circulation through the bones he fed some animals alternately upon madder and their common food for some time and he found their bones tinctured with alternate layers in conformity to their manner of living from all this he naturally concluded that the blood circulated through the bones as it does through every other part of the body and that how solid soever they seemed yet like the softest parts they were furnished through all their substance with their proper canals nevertheless these canals are of very different capacities during the different stages of life in infancy they are capacious and the blood flows almost as freely through the bones as through any other part of the body in manhood their size is greatly diminished the vessels are almost imperceptible and the circulation through them is proportionably slow but in the decline of life the blood which flows through the bones no longer contributing to their growth must necessarily serve to increase their hardness the channels that every where run through the human frame may be compared to those pipes that we every where see crusted on the inside by the water for a long continuance running through them both every day grow less and less by the small rigid particles which are deposited within them thus as the vessels are by degrees diminished the juices also which were necessary for the circulation through them are diminished in proportion till at length in old age those props of the human frame are not only more solid but more brittle  the cartilages or gristles which may be considered as bones beginning to be formed grow also more rigid the juices circulating through them for there is a circulation through all parts of the body every day contributes to render them harder so that these substances which in youth are elastic and pliant in age become hard and bony as these cartilages are generally placed near the joints the motion of the joints also must of consequence become more difficult thus in old age every action of the body is performed with labor and the cartilages formerly so supple will now sooner break than bend  as the cartilages acquire hardness and unfit the joints for motion so also that mucous liquor which is always separated between the joints and which serves like oil to an hinge to give them an easy and ready play is now grown more scanty it becomes thicker and more clammy more unfit for answering the purposes of motion and from thence in old age every joint is not only stiff but awkward at every motion this clammy liquor is heard to crack and it is not without the greatest effort of the muscles that its resistance is overcome i have seen an old person that never moved a single joint that did not thus give notice of the violence that was done it  the membranes that cover the bones the joints and the rest of the body become as we grow old more dense and more dry these which surround the bones soon cease to be ductile the fibers of which the muscles or flesh is composed become every day more rigid and while to the touch the body seems as we advance in years to grow softer it is in reality increasing in hardness it is the skin and not the flesh that we feel upon such occasions the fat and the flabbiness of that seems to give an appearance of softness which the flesh itself is very far from having there are few can doubt this after trying the difference between the flesh of young and old animals the first is soft and tender the last is hard and dry  the skin is the only part of the body that age does not contribute to harden that stretches to every degree of tension and we have horrid instances of its pliancy in many disorders incident to humanity in youth therefore while the body is vigorous and increasing it still gives way to its growth but although it thus adapts itself to our increase it does not in the same manner conform to our decay the skin which in youth was filled and glossy when the body begins to decline has not elasticity enough to shrink entirely with its dimunition it hangs therefore in wrinkles which no art can remove the wrinkles of the body in general proceed from this cause but those of the face seem to proceed from another namely from the many varieties of positions into which it is put by the speech the food or the passions every grimace and every passion wrinkles up the visage into different forms these are visible enough in young persons but what at first was accidental or transitory becomes unalterably fixed in the visage as it grows older from hence we may conclude that a freedom from passions not only adds to the happiness of the mind but preserves the beauty of the face and the person that has not felt their influence is less strongly marked by the decays of nature  hence therefore as we advance in age the bones the cartilages the membranes the flesh the skin and every fiber of the body becomes more solid more brittle and more dry every part shrinks every motion becomes more slow the circulation of the fluids is performed with less freedom perspiration diminishes the secretions alter the digestion becomes slow and laborious and the juices no longer serving to convey their accustomed nourishment those parts may be said to live no longer when the circulation ceases thus the body dies by little and little all its functions are diminished by degrees life is driven from one part of the frame to another universal rigidity prevails and death at last seizes upon the little that is left  as the bones the cartilages the muscles and all other parts of the body are softer in women than in men these parts must of consequence require a longer time to come to that hardness which hastens death women therefore ought to be a longer time in growing old than men and this is actually the case if we consult the tables which have been drawn up respecting human life we shall find that after a certain age they are more long lived than men all other circumstances the same a woman of sixty has a better chance than a man of the same age to live till eighty upon the whole we may infer that such persons as have been slow in coming up to maturity will also be slow in growing old and this holds as well with regard to other animals as to man  the whole duration of the life of either vegetables or animals may be in some measure determined from their manner of coming to maturity the tree or the animal which takes but a short time to increase to its utmost pitch perishes much sooner than such as are less premature in both the increase upwards is first accomplished and not till they have acquired their greatest degree of height do they begin to spread in bulk man grows in stature till about the age of seventeen but his body is not completely developed till about thirty dogs on the other hand are at their utmost size in a year and become as bulky as they usually are in another however man who is so long in growing continues to live for fourscore or an hundred years but the dog seldom above twelve or thirteen in general also it may be said that large animals live longer than little ones as they usually take a larger time to grow but in all animals one thing is equally certain that they carry the causes of their own decay about them and that their deaths are necessary and inevitable the prospects which some visionaries have formed of perpetuating life by remedies have been often enough proved false by their own example such unaccountable schemes would therefore have died with them had not the love of life always augmented our credulity  when the body is naturally well formed it is possible to lengthen out the period of life for some years by management temperance in diet is often found conducive to this end the famous cornaro who lived to above an hundred years although his constitution was naturally feeble is a strong instance of the benefit of an abstemious life moderation in the passions also may contribute to extend the term of our existence fontenelle the celebrated writer was naturally of a very weak and delicate habit of body he was affected by the smallest irregularities and had frequently suffered severe fits of illness from the slightest causes but the remarkable equality of his temper and his seeming want of passion lengthened out his life to above an hundred it was remarkable of him that nothing could vex or make him uneasy every occurrence seemed equally pleasing and no event however unfortunate seemed to come unexpected however the term of life can be prolonged but for a very little time by any art we can use we are told of men who have lived beyond the ordinary duration of human existence such as par who lived to an hundred and fortyfour and jenkins to an hundred and sixtyfive yet these men used no peculiar arts to prolong life on the contrary it appears that these as well as some others remarkable for their longevity were peasants accustomed to the greatest fatigues who had no settled rules of diet but who often indulged in accidental excesses indeed if we consider that the european the negroe the chinese and the american the civilized man and the savage the rich and the poor the inhabitant of the city and of the country though all so different in other respects are yet entirely similar in the period allotted them for living if we consider that neither the difference of race of climate of nourishment of convenience or of soil makes any difference in the term of life if we consider that those men who live upon raw flesh or dried fishes upon seago or rice upon cassava or upon roots nevertheless live as long as those who are fed upon bread and meat we shall readily be brought to acknowledge that the duration of life depends neither upon habit customs or the quantity of food we shall confess that nothing can change the laws of that mechanism which regulates the number of our years and which can chiefly be affected only by long fasting or great excess  if there be any difference in the different periods of mans existence it ought principally to be ascribed to the quality of the air it has been observed that in elevated situations there have been found more old people than in those that were low the mountains of scotland wales auvergne and switzerland have furnished more instances of extreme old age than the plains of holland flanders germany or poland but in general the duration of life is nearly the same in most countries man if not cut off by accidental diseases is generally found to live to ninety or an hundred years our ancestors did not live beyond that date and since the times of david this term has made but little alteration  if we be asked how in the beginning men lived so much longer than at present and by what means their lives were extended to nine hundred and thirty or even nine hundred and sixty years it may be answered that the productions of the earth upon which they fed might be of a different nature at that time from what they are at present it may be answered that the term was abridged by divine command in order to keep the earth from being overstocked with human inhabitants since if every person were now to live and generate for nine hundred years mankind would be increased to such a degree that there would be no room for subsistence so that the plan of providence would be altered which is seen not to produce life without providing a proper supply  but to whatever extent life may be prolonged or however some may have delayed the effects of age death is the certain goal to which all are hastening all the causes of decay which have been mentioned contribute to bring on this dreaded dissolution however nature approaches to this awful period by slow and imperceptible degrees life is consuming day after day and some one of our faculties or vital principles is every hour dying before the rest so that death is only the last shade in the picture and it is probable that man suffers a greater change in going from youth to age than from age into the grave when we first begin to live our lives may scarcely be said to be our own as the child grows life increases in the same proportion and is at its height in the prime of manhood but as soon as the body begins to decrease life decreases also for as the human frame diminishes and its juices circulate in smaller quantity life diminishes and circulates with less vigor so that as we begin to live by degrees we begin to die in the same manner  why then should we fear death if our lives have been such as not to make eternity dreadful why should we fear that moment which is prepared by a thousand other moments of the same kind the first pangs of sickness being probably greater than the last struggles of departure death in most persons is as calmly endured as the disorder that brings it on if we enquire from those whose business it is to attend the sick and the dying we shall find that except in a very few acute cases where the patient dies in agonies the greatest number die quietly and seemingly without pain and even the agonies of the former rather terrify the spectators than torment the patient for how many have we not seen who have been accidentally relieved from this extremity and yet had no memory of what they then endured in fact they had ceased to live during that time when they ceased to have sensation and their pains were only those of which they had an idea  the greatest number of mankind die therefore without sensation and of those few that still preserve their faculties entire to the last moment there is scarce one of them that does not also preserve the hopes of still outliving his disorder nature for the happiness of man has rendered this sentiment stronger than his reason a person dying of an incurable disorder which he must know to be so by frequent examples of his case which he perceives to be so by the inquietude of all around him by the tears of his friends and the departure or the face of the physician is nevertheless still in hopes of getting over it his interest is so great that he only attends to his own representations the judgment of others is considered as an hasty conclusion and while death every moment makes new inroads upon his constitution and destroys life in some part hope still seems to escape the universal ruin and is the last that submits to the blow  cast your eyes upon a sick man who has an hundred times told you that he felt himself dying that he was convinced he could not recover and that he was ready to expire examine what passes on his visage when through zeal or indiscretion any one comes to tell him that his end is at hand you will see him change like one who is told an unexpected piece of news he now appears not to have thoroughly believed what he had been telling you himself he doubted much and his fears were greater than his hopes but he still had some feeble expectations of living and would not have seen the approaches of death unless he had been alarmed by the mistaken assiduity of his attendants  death therefore is not that terrible thing which we suppose it to be it is a spectre which frights us at a distance but which disappears when we come to approach it more closely our ideas of its terrors are conceived in prejudice and dressed up by fancy we regard it not only as the greatest misfortune but as also an evil accompanied with the most excruciating tortures we have even increased our apprehensions by reasoning on the extent of our sufferings it must be dreadful say some since it is sufficient to separate the soul from the body it must be long since our sufferings are proportioned to the succession of our ideas and these being painful must succeed each other with extreme rapidity in this manner has false philosophy labored to augment the miseries of our nature and to aggravate that period which nature has kindly covered with insensibility neither the mind nor the body can suffer these calamities the mind is at that time mostly without ideas and the body too much enfeebled to be capable of perceiving its pain a very acute pain produces either death or fainting which is a state similar to death the body can suffer but to a certain degree if the torture becomes excessive it destroys itself and the mind ceases to perceive when the body can no longer endure  in this manner excessive pain admits of no reflection and wherever there are any signs of it we may be sure that the sufferings of the patient are no greater than what we ourselves may have remembered to endure  but in the article of death we have many instances in which the dying person has shown that very reflection that presupposes an absence of the greatest pain and consequently that pang which ends life cannot even be so great as those which have preceded thus when charles xii was shot at the siege of frederick shall he was seen to clap his hand on the hilt of his sword and although the blow was great enough to terminate one of the boldest and bravest lives in the world yet it was not painful enough to destroy reflection he perceived himself attacked he reflected that he ought to defend himself and his body obeyed the impulse of his mind even in the last extremity thus it is the prejudice of persons in health and not the body in pain that makes us suffer from the approach of death we have all our lives contracted an habit of making out excessive pleasures and pains and nothing but repeated experience shows us how seldom the one can be suffered or the other enjoyed to the utmost  if there be any thing necessary to confirm what we have said concerning the gradual cessation of life or the insensible approaches of our end nothing can more effectually prove it than the uncertainty of the signs of death if we consult what winslow or bruhier have said upon this subject we shall be convinced that between life and death the shade is so very undistinguishable that even all the powers of art can scarcely determine where the one ends and the other begins the color of the visage the warmth of the body the suppleness of the joints are but uncertain signs of life still subsisting while on the contrary the paleness of the complexion the coldness of the body the stiffness of the extremities the cessation of all motion and the total insensibility of the parts are but uncertain marks of death begun in the same manner also with regard to the pulse and the breathing these motions are often so kept under that it is impossible to perceive them by approaching a lookingglass to the mouth of the person supposed to be dead people often expect to find whether he breathes or not but this is a very uncertain experiment the glass is frequently sullied by the vapor of the dead mans body and often the person is still alive although the glass is no way tarnished in the same manner neither burning nor scarifying neither noises in the ears nor pungent spirits applied to the nostrils give certain signs of the discontinuance of life and there are many instances of persons who have endured them all and afterward recovered without any external assistance to the astonishment of the spectators how careful therefore should we be before we commit those who are dearest to us to the grave to be well assured of their departure experience justice humanity all persuade us not to hasten the funerals of our friends but to keep their bodies unburied until we have certain signs of their real decease  chap xi of the varieties in the human race hitherto we have compared man with other animals we now come to compare men with each other we have hitherto considered him as an individual endowed with excellencies above the rest of the creation we now come to consider the advantages which men have over men and the various kinds with which our earth is inhabited  if we compare the minute differences of mankind there is scarce one nation upon the earth that entirely resembles another and there may be said to be as many different kinds of men as there are countries inhabited one polished nation does not differ more from another than the merest savages do from those savages that lie even contiguous to them and it frequently happens that a river or a mountain divides two barbarous tribes that are unlike each other in manners customs features and complexion but these differences however perceivable do not form such distinctions as come within a general picture of the varieties of mankind custom accident or fashion may produce considerable alterations in neighboring nations their being derived from ancestors of a different climate or complexion may contribute to make accidental distinctions which every day grow less and it may be said that two neighboring nations how unlike soever at first will assimilate by degrees and by long continuance the difference between them will at last become almost imperceptible it is not therefore between contiguous nations we are to look for any strong marked varieties in the human species it is by comparing the inhabitants of opposite climates and distant countries those who live within the polar circle with those beneath the equator those that live on one side of the globe with those that occupy the other  of all animals the differences between mankind are the smallest of the lower races of creatures the changes are so great as often entirely to disguise the natural animal and to distort or to disfigure its shape but the chief differences in man are rather taken from the tincture of his skin than the variety of his figure and in all climates he preserves his erect deportment and the marked superiority of his form if we look round the world there seem to be not above six distinct varieties in the human depiction of the laplander the laplander e martin sculp species each of which is strongly marked and speaks the kind seldom to have mixed with any other i have taken four of these varieties from linnaeus those of the laplanders and tartars from mr buffon  but there is nothing in the shape nothing in the faculties that shows their coming from different originals and the varieties of climate of nourishment and custom are sufficient to produce every change  the first distinct race of men is found round the polar regions the laplanders the esquimaux indians the samoeid tartars the inhabitants of nova zembla the borandians the greenlanders and the natives of kamskatka may be considered as one peculiar race of people all greatly resembling each other in their stature their complexion their customs and their ignorance these nations being under a rigorous climate where the productions of nature are but few and the provisions coarse and unwholesome their bodies have shrunk to the nature of their food and their complexions have suffered from cold almost a similar change to what heat is known to produce their color being a deep brown in some places inclining to actual blackness these therefore in general are found to be a race of short stature and odd shape with countenances as savage as their manners are barbarous the visage in these countries is large and broad the nose flat and short the eyes of a yellowish brown inclining to blackness the eyelids drawn toward the temples the cheekbones extremely high the mouth very large the lips thick and turned outward the voice thin and squeaking the head large the hair black and straight the color of the skin of a dark greyish krantz  they are short in stature the generality not being above four feet high and the tallest not above five among all these nations the women are as deformed as the men and resemble them so nearly that one cannot at first distinguish the sexes among them  these nations not only resemble each other in their deformity their dwarfishness the color of their hair and eyes but they have all in a great measure the same inclinations and the same manners being all equally rude superstitious and stupid the danish laplanders have a large black cat to which they communicate all their secrets and consult in all their affairs among the swedish laplanders there is in every family a drum for consulting the devil and although these nations are robust and nimble yet they are so cowardly that they never can be brought into the field gustavus adolphus attempted to make a regiment of laplanders but he found it impossible to accomplish his design for it should seem that they can live only in their own country and in their own manner they make use of skates which are made of fir of near three feet long and half a foot broad these are pointed and raised before and tied to the foot by straps of leather with these they skate upon the icy snow with such velocity that they very easily overtake the swiftest animals they make use also of a pole pointed with iron at one end and rounded at the other this pole serves to push them along to direct their course to support them from falling to stop the impetuosity of their motion and to kill that game which they have overtaken upon these skates they descend the steepest mountains and scale the most craggy precipices and in these exercises the women are not less skilful than the men they have all the use of the bow and arrow which seems to be a contrivance common to all barbarous nations and which however at first required no small skill to invent they lance a javelin also with great force and some say that they can hit a mark no larger than a crown at thirty yards distance and with such force as would pierce a man through they are all hunters and particularly pursue the ermine the fox the ounce and the martin for the sake of their skins these they barter with their southern neighbors for brandy and tobacco both which they are fond of to excess their food is principally dried fish the flesh of reindeer and bears their bread is composed of the bones of fishes pounded and mixed with the inside tender bark of the pine tree their drink is trainoil or brandy and when deprived of these water in which juniper berries have been infused with regard to their morals they have all the virtues of simplicity and all the vices of ignorance they offer their wives and daughters to strangers and seem to think it a particular honor if their offer be accepted they have no idea of religion or a supreme being the greatest number of them are idolaters and their superstition is as profound as their worship is contemptible wretched and ignorant as they are yet they do not want pride they set themselves far above the rest of mankind and krantz assures us that when the greenlanders are got together nothing is so customary among them as to turn the europeans into ridicule they are obliged indeed to yield them the preeminence in understanding and mechanic arts but they do not know how to set any value upon these they therefore count themselves the only civilized and wellbred people in the world and it is common with them when they see a quiet or a modest stranger to say that he is almost as well bred as a greenlander  from this description therefore this whole race of people may be considered as distinct from any other their long continuance in a climate the most inhospitable their being obliged to subsist on food the most coarse and ill prepared the savageness of their manners and their laborious lives all have contributed to shorten their stature and to deform their bodies elliss voyage p      in proportion as we approach toward the north pole the size of the natives appears to diminish growing less and less as we advance higher till we come to those latitudes that are destitute of all inhabitants whatsoever  the wretched natives of these climates seem fitted by nature to endure the rigours of their situation as their food is but scanty and precarious their patience in hunger is amazing krantz p     vol i  a man who has ate nothing for four days can manage his little canoe in the most furious waves and calmly subsist in the midst of a tempest that would quickly dash an european boat to pieces their strength is not less amazing than their patience a woman among them will carry a piece of timber or a stone near double the weight of what an european can lift their bodies are of a dark gray all over and their faces brown or olive the tincture of their skins partly seems to arise from their dirty manner of living being generally daubed with trainoil and partly from the rigours of climate as the sudden alterations of cold and raw air in winter and of burning heats in summer shade their complexions by degrees till in a succession of generations they at last become almost black as the countries in which these reside are the most barren so the natives seem the most barbarous of any part of the earth their more southern neighbors of america treat them with the same scorn that a polished nation would treat a savage one and we may readily judge of the rudeness of those manners which even a native of canada can think more barbarous than his own  but the gradations of nature are imperceptible and while the north is peopled with such miserable inhabitants there are here and there to be found upon the edges of these regions people of larger stature and completer figure a whole race of the dwarfish breed is often found to come down from the north and settle more to the southward and on the contrary it sometimes happens that southern nations are seen higher up in the midst of these diminutive tribes where they have continued for time immemorial thus the ostiac tartars seem to be a race that have traveled down from the north and to be originally sprung from the minute savages we have been describing there are also norwegians and finlanders of proper stature who are seen to inhabit in latitudes higher even than lapland these however are but accidental migrations and serve as shades to unite the distinct varieties of mankind  the second great variety in the human species seems to be that of the tartar race from whence probably the little men we have been describing originally proceeded the tartar country taken in general comprehends the greatest part of asia and is consequently a general name given to a number of nations of various forms and complexions but however they seem to differ from each other they all agree in being very unlike the people of any other country whatsoever all these nations have the upper part of the visage very broad and wrinkled even while yet in their youth their noses are short and flat their eyes little and sunk in their heads and in some of them they are seen five or six inches asunder their cheekbones are high the lower part of their visage narrow the chin long and advanced forward their teeth of an enormous size and growing separate from each other their eyebrows thick and large and covering their eyes their eyelids thick the face broad and flat the complexion olive colored and the hair black they are of a middle size extremely strong and very robust they have but little beard which grows straglingly on the chin they have large thighs and short legs the ugliest of all are the calmoucks in whose appearance there seems to be something frightful they all lead an erratic life remaining under tents of hair or skins they live upon horse flesh and that of camels either raw or a little sodden between the horse and the saddle they eat also fish dried in the sun their most usual drink is mares milk fermented with millet ground into meal they all have the head shaven except a lock of hair on the top which they let grow sufficiently long to form into tresses on each side of the face the depiction of the chinese the chinese e martin sculp women who are as ugly as the men wear their hair which they bind up with bits of copper and other ornaments of a like nature the majority of these nations have no religion no settled notions of morality no decency of behavior they are chiefly robbers and the natives of dagestan who live near their more polished neighbors make a traffic of tartar slaves who have been stolen and sell them to the turks and the persians their chief riches consist in horses of which perhaps there are more in tartary than in any other part of the world the natives are taught by custom to live in the same place with their horses they are continually employed in managing them and at last bring them to such great obedience that the horse seems actually to understand the riders intention  to this race of men also we must refer the chinese and the japanese however different they seem in their manners and ceremonies it is the form of the body that we are now principally considering and there is between these countries a surprising resemblance it is in general allowed that the chinese have broad faces small eyes flat noses and scarce any beard that they are broad and square shouldered and rather less in stature than europeans these are marks common to them and the tartars and they may therefore be considered as being derived from the same original i have observed says chardin that in all the people from the east and the north of the caspian sea to the peninsula of malacca that the lines of the face and the formation of the visage is the same this has induced me to believe that all these nations are derived from the same original however different either their complexions or their manners may appear for as to the complexion that proceeds entirely from the climate and the food and as to the manners these are generally the result of their different degrees of wealth or power that they come from one stock is evident also from this that the tartars who settle in china quickly resemble the chinese and on the contrary the chinese who settle in tartary soon assume the figure and the manners of the tartars  the japanese so much resemble the chinese that one cannot hesitate to rank them in the same class they only differ in being rather browner as they inhabit a more southern climate they are in general described as of a brown complexion a short stature a broad flat face a very little beard and black hair their customs and ceremonies are nearly the same their ideas of beauty similar and their artificial deformities of blackening the teeth and bandaging the feet entirely alike in both countries they both therefore proceed from the same stock and although they differ very much from their brutal progenitors yet they owe their civilization wholly to the mildness of the climate in which they reside and to the peculiar fertility of the soil to this tribe also we may refer the cochin chinese the siamese the tonquinese and the inhabitants of aracan laos and pegu who though all differing from the chinese and each other nevertheless have too strong a resemblance not to betray their common original  another which makes the third variety in the human species is that of the southern asiatics the form of whose features and persons may be easily distinguished from those of the tartar races the nations that inhabit the peninsula of india seem to be the principal stock from whence the inhabitants of the islands that lie scattered in the indian ocean have been peopled they are in general of a slender shape with long strait black hair and often with roman noses thus they resemble the europeans in stature and features but greatly differ in color and habit of body the indians are of an olive color and in the more southern parts quite black although the word mogul in their language signifies a white man the women are extremely delicate and bathe very often they are of an olive color as well as the men their legs and thighs are long and their bodies short which is the opposite to what is seen among the women of europe they are as i am assured by no means so fruitful as the european women but they feel the pains of childbirth with much less sensibility and are generally up and well the day following in fact these pains seem greatest in all countries where the women are most delicate or the constitution enfeebled by luxury or indolence the women of savage nations seem in a great measure exempt from painful labors and even the hard working wives of the peasants among ourselves have this advantage from a life of industry that their child bearing is less painful over all india the children arrive sooner at maturity than with us of europe they often marry and consummate the husband at ten years old and the wife at eight and they frequently have children at that age however the women who are mothers so soon cease bearing before they are arrived at thirty and at that time they appear wrinkled and seem marked with all the deformities of age the indians have long been remarkable for their cowardice and effeminacy every conqueror that has but attempted the invasion of their country having succeeded the warmth of the climate entirely influences their manners they are slothful submissive and luxurious satisfied with sensual happiness alone they find no pleasure in thinking and contented with slavery they are ready to obey any master many tribes among them eat nothing that has life they are fearful of killing the meanest insect and have even erected hospitals for the maintenance of all kinds of vermin the asiatic dress also is a loose flowing garment rather fitted for the purposes of peace and indolence than of industry or war the vigor of the asiatics is therefore in general conformable to their dress and nourishment fed upon rice and clothed in effeminate silk vestments their soldiers are unable to oppose the onset of an european army and from the times of alexander to the present day we have scarce any instances of their success in arms upon the whole therefore they may be considered as a feeble race of sensualists too dull to find rapture in any pleasures and too indolent to turn their gravity into wisdom to this class we may refer the persians and arabians and in general the inhabitants of the islands that lie scattered in the indian ocean  the fourth striking variety in the human species is to be found among the negroes of africa this gloomy race of mankind is found to blacken all the southern parts of africa from eighteen degrees north of the line to its extreme termination at the cape of good hope i know it is said that the caffres who inhabit the southern extremity of that large continent are not to be ranked among the negroe race however the difference between them in point of color and features is so small that they may very easily be grouped in this general picture and in the one or two that i have seen i could perceive not the smallest difference each of the negroe nations it must be owned differ among each other they have their peculiar countries for beauty like us and different nations as in europe pride themselves upon the regularity of their features those of guinea for instance are extremely ugly and have aninsupportable scent those of mosambique are reckoned beautiful and have no ill smell whatsoever the negroes in general are of a black color with a smooth soft skin this smoothness proceeds from the downy softness depiction of the african the african e martin sculp of the hair which grows upon it the strength of which gives a roughness to the feel in those of a white complexion their skins therefore have a velvet smoothness and seem less braced upon the muscles than ours the hair of their heads differs entirely from what we are accustomed to being soft woolly and short the beard also partakes of the same qualities but in this it differs that it soon turns gray which the hair is seldom found to do so that several are seen with white beards and black hair at the same time their eyes are generally of a deep hazle their noses flat and short their lips thick and tumid and their teeth of an ivory whiteness this their only beauty however is set off by the color of their skin the contrast between the black and white being the more observable it is false to say that their features are deformed by art since in the negroe children born in european countries the same deformities are seen to prevail the same flatness in the nose and the same prominence in the lips they are in general said to be well shaped but of such as i have seen i never found one that might be justly called so their legs being mostly ill formed and most commonly bending outward on the shinbone but it is not only in those parts of their bodies that are obvious that they are disproportioned those parts which among us are usually concealed by dress with them are large and languid linnaeus in prima linea sua faeminas africanas depingit sicut aliquid deforme in part genitali gestantes quod sinum pudoris nuncupat attamen nihil different a nostratibus in hac part nisi quod labia pudendae sint aliquantulum tumidiora in hominibus etiam penis est longior et multo laxior  the womens breasts after bearing one child hang down below the navel and it is customary with them to suckle the child at their backs by throwing the breast over the shoulder as their persons are thus naturally deformed at least to our imaginations their minds are equally incapable of strong exertions the climate seems to relax their mental powers still more than those of the body they are therefore in general found to be stupid indolent and mischievous the arabians themselves many colonies of whom have migrated southward into the most inland parts of africa seem to have degenerated from their ancestors and forgetting their ancient learning with their beauty have become a race scarce any way distinguishable from the original natives nor does it seem to have fared otherwise with the portuguese who about two centuries ago settled along this coast they also are become depiction of the american indian the american b west del e martin sculp almost as black as the negroes and are said by some to be even more barbarous  the inhabitants of america make a fifth race as different from all the rest in color as they are distinct in habitation the natives of america except in the northern extremity where they resemble the laplanders are of a red or copper color and although in the old world different climates produce a variety of complexions and customs the natives of the new continent seem to resemble each other in almost every respect they are all nearly of one color all have black thick strait hair and thin black beards which however they take care to pluck out by the roots they have in general flat noses with high cheek bones and small eyes and these deformities of nature they endeavor to increase by art they flatten the nose and often the whole head of their children while the bones are yet susceptible of every impression they paint the body and face of various colors and consider the hair upon any part of it except the head as a deformity which they are careful to eradicate their limbs are generally slighter made than those of the europeans and i am assured they are far from being so strong all these savages seem to be cowardly they seldom are known to face their enemies in the field but fall upon them at an advantage and the greatness of their fears serves to increase the rigours of their cruelty the wants which they often sustain makes them surprizingly patient in adversity distress by being grown familiar becomes less terrible so that their patience is less the result of fortitude than of custom they have all a serious air although they seldom think and however cruel to their enemies are kind and just to each other in short the customs of savage nations in every country are almost the same a wild independent and precarious life produces a peculiar train of virtues and vices and patience and hospitality indolence and rapacity content and sincerity are found not less among the natives of america than all the barbarous nations of the globe  the sixth and last variety of the human species is that of the europeans and the nations bordering on them in this class we may reckon the georgians circassians and mingrelians the inhabitants of asia minor and the northern parts of africa together with a part of those countries which lie northwest of the caspian sea the inhabitants of these countries differ a good deal from each other but they generally agree in the color of their bodies the beauty of their complexions the largeness of their limbs and the vigor of their understandings those arts which might have had their invention among the other races of mankind have come to perfection there in barbarous countries the inhabitants go either naked or are awkwardly clothed in furs or feathers in countries semibarbarous the robes are loose and flowing but here the clothing is less made for show than expedition and unites as much as possible the extremes of ornament and dispatch  to one or other of these classes we may refer the people of every country and as each nation has been less visited by strangers or has had less commerce with the rest of mankind we find their persons and their manners more strongly impressed with one or other of the characters mentioned above on the contrary in those places where trade has long flourished or where enemies have made many incursions the races are usually found blended and properly fall beneath no one character thus in the islands of the indian ocean where a trade has been carried on for time immemorial the inhabitants appear to be a mixture of all the nations upon the earth white olive brown and black men are all seen living together in the same city and propagate a mixed breed that can be referred to none of the classes into which naturalists have thought proper to divide mankind  of all the colors by which mankind is diversified it is easy to perceive that ours is not only the most beautiful to the eye but the most advantageous the fair complexion seems if i may so express it as a transparent covering to the soul all the variations of the passions every expression of joy or sorrow flows to the cheek and without language marks the mind in the slightest change of health also the color of the european face is the most exact index and often teaches us to prevent those disorders that we do not as yet perceive not but that the african black and the asiatic olive complexions admit of their alterations also but these are neither so distinct nor so visible as with us and in some countries the color of the visage is never found to change but the face continues in the same settled shade in shame and in sickness in anger and despair  the color therefore most natural to man ought to be that which is most becoming and it is found that in all regions the children are born fair or at least red and that they grow more black or tawny as they advance in age it should seem consequently that man is naturally white since the same causes that darken the complexion in infants may have originally operated in slower degrees in blackening whole nations we could therefore readily account for the blackness of different nations did we not see the americans who live under the line as well as the natives of negroland of a red color and but a very small shade darker than the natives of the northern latitudes in the same continent for this reason some have sought for other causes of blackness than the climate and have endeavored to prove that the blacks are a race of people bred from one man who was marked with accidental blackness this however is but mere ungrounded conjecture and although the americans are not so dark as the negroes yet we must still continue in the ancient opinion that the deepness of the color proceeds from the excessive heat of the climate for if we compare the heats of africa with those of america we shall find they bear no proportion to each other in america all that part of the continent which lies under the line is cool and pleasant either shaded by mountains or refreshed by breezes from the sea but in africa the wide tract of country that lies under the line is very extensive and the soil sandy the reflection of the sun therefore from so large a surface of earth is almost intolerable and it is not to be wondered at that the inhabitants should bear in their looks the marks of the inhospitable climate in america the country is but thinly inhabited and the more torrid tracts are generally left desert by the inhabitants for which reason they are not so deeply tinged by the beams of the sun but in africa the whole face of the country is fully peopled and the natives are obliged to endure their situation without a power of migration it is there consequently that they are in a manner tied down to feel all the severity of the heat and their complexions take the darkest hue they are capable of receiving we need not therefore have recourse to any imaginary propagation from persons accidentally black since the climate is a cause obvious and sufficient to produce the effect  in fact if we examine the complexions of different countries we shall find them darken in proportion to the heat of their climate and the shades gradually to deepen as they approach the line some nations indeed may be found not so much tinged by the sun as others although they lie nearer the line but this ever proceeds from some accidental causes either from the country lying higher and consequently being colder or from the natives bathing oftener and leading a more civilized life in general it may be asserted that as we approach the line we find the inhabitants of each country grow browner until the color deepens into perfect blackness thus taking our standard from the whitest race of people and beginning with our own country which i believe bids fairest for the preeminence we shall find the french who are more southern a slight shade deeper than we going farther down the spaniards are browner than the french the inhabitants of fez darker than they and the natives of negroeland the darkest of all in what manner the sun produces this effect and how the same luminary which whitens wax and linen should darken the human complexion is not easy to conceive sir thomas brown first supposed that a mucous substance which had something of a vitriolic quality settled under the reticular membrane and grew darker with heat others have supposed that the blackness lay in the epidermis or scarf skin which was burnt up like leather but nothing has been satisfactorily discovered upon the subject it is sufficient that we are assured of the fact and that we have no doubt of the suns tinging the complexion in proportion to its vicinity  but we are not to suppose that the sun is the only cause of darkening the skin the wind extreme cold hard labor or coarse and sparing nourishment are all found to contribute to this effect we find the peasants of every country who are most exposed to the weather a shade darker than the higher ranks of people the savage inhabitants of all places are exposed still more and therefore contract a still deeper hue and this will account for the tawny color of the north american indians although they live in a climate the same or even more northerly than ours yet they are found to be of complexions very different from those of europe but it must be considered that they live continually exposed to the sun that they use many methods to darken their skins by art painting them with red oker and anointing them with the fat of bears had they taken for a succession of several generations the same precautions to brighten their color that an european does it is very probable that they would in time come to have similar complexions and perhaps dispute the prize of beauty  the extremity of cold is not less productive of a tawny complexion than that of heat the natives of the artic circle as was observed are all brown and those that lie most to the north are almost entirely black in this manner both extremes are unfavourable to the human form and color and the same effects are produced under the poles that are found at the line  with regard to the stature of different countries that seems chiefly to result from the nature of the food and the quantity of the supply not but that the severity of heat or cold may in some measure diminish the growth and produce a dwarfishness of make but in general the food is the great agent in producing this effect where that is supplied in large quantities and where its quality is wholesome and nutrimental the inhabitants are generally seen above the ordinary stature on the contrary where it is afforded in a sparing qty or very coarse and void of nourishment in its kind the inhabitants degenerate and sink below the ordinary size of mankind in this respect they resemble other animals whose bodies by proper feeding may be greatly augmented an ox on the fertile plains of india grows to a size four times as large as the diminutive animal of the same kind bred in the alps the horses bred in the plains are larger than those of the mountain so it is with man the inhabitants of the valley are usually found taller than those of the hill the natives of the highlands of scotland for instance are short broad and hardy those of the lowlands are tall and shapely the inhabitants of greenland who live upon dried fish and seals are less than those of gambia or senegal where nature supplies them with vegetable and animal abundance  the form of the face seems rather to be the result of custom nations who have long considered some artificial deformity as beautiful who have industriously lessened the feet or flattened the nose by degrees begin to receive the impression they are taught to assume and nature in a course of ages shapes itself to the constraint and assumes hereditary deformity we find nothing more common in births than for children to inherit sometimes even the accidental deformities of their parents we have many instances of squinting in the father which he received from fright or habit communicated to the offspring and i myself have seen a child distinctly marked with a scar similar to one the father had received in battle in this manner accidental deformities may become natural ones and by assiduity may be continued and even increased through successive generations from this therefore may have arisen the small eyes and long ears of the tartars and chinese nations from hence originally may have come the flat noses of the blacks and the flat heads of the american indians  in this slight survey therefore i think we may see that all the variations in the human figure as far as they differ from our own are produced either by the rigor of the climate the bad quality or the scantiness of the provisions or by the savage customs of the country they are actual marks of the degeneracy in the human form and we may consider the european figure and color as standards to which to refer all other varieties and with which to compare them in proportion as the tartar or american approaches nearer to european beauty we consider the race as less degenerated in proportion as he differs more widely he has made greater deviations from his original form  that we have all sprung from one common parent we are taught both by reason and religion to believe and we have good reason also to think that the europeans resemble him more than any of the rest of his children however it must not be concealed that the olive colored asiatic and even the jet black negroe claim this honor of hereditary resemblance and assert that white men are mere deviations from original perfection odd as this opinion may seem they have got linnaeus the celebrated naturalist on their side who supposes man a native of the tropical climates and only a sojourner more to the north but not to enter into a controversy upon a matter of a very remote speculation i think one argument alone will suffice to prove the contrary and show that the white man is the original source from whence the other varieties have sprung we have frequently seen white children produced from black parents but have never seen a black offspring the production of two whites from hence we may conclude that whiteness is the color to which mankind naturally tends for as in the tulip the parent stock is known by all the artificial varieties breaking into it so in man that color must be original which never alters and to which all the rest are accidentally seen to change i have seen in london at different times two white negroes the issue of black parents that served to convince me of the truth of this theory i had before been taught to believe that the whiteness of the negroe skin was a disease a kind of milky whiteness that might be called rather a leprous crust than a natural complexion i was taught to suppose that the numberless white negroes found in various parts of africa the white men that go by the name of chacrelas in the east indies and the white americans near the isthmus of darien in the west indies were all as so many diseased persons and even more deformed than the blackest of the natives but upon examining that negroe which was last shown in london i found the color to be exactly like that of an european the visage white and ruddy and the lips of the proper redness however there were sufficient marks to convince me of its descent the hair was white and woolly and very unlike any thing i had seen before the iris of the eye was yellow inclining to red the nose was flat exactly resembling that of a negroe and the lips thick and prominent no doubt therefore remained of the childs having been born of negroe parents and the person who showed it had attestations to convince the most incredulous from this then we see that the variations of the negroe color is into whiteness whereas the white are never found to have a race of negroe children upon the whole therefore all those changes which the african the asiatic or the american undergo are but accidental deformities which a kinder climate better nourishment or more civilized manners would in a course of centuries very probably remove  chap xi of monsters hitherto i have only spoken of those varieties in the human species that are common to whole nations but there are varieties of another kind which are only found in the individual and being more rarely seen are therefore called monstrous if we examine into the varieties of distorted nature there is scarce a limb of the body or scarce a feature in the face that has not suffered some reprobation either from art or nature being enlarged or diminished lengthened or wrested from its due proportion linnaeus after having given a catalogue of monsters particularly adds the flat heads of canada the long heads of the chinese and the slender waists of the women of europe who by strait lacing take such pains to destroy their health through a mistaken desire to improve their beauty linnaei syst vol i p    monorchides ut minus fertiles  it belongs more to the physician than the naturalist to attend to these minute deformities and indeed it is a melancholy contemplation to speculate upon a catalogue of calamities inflicted by unpitying nature or brought upon us by our own caprice some however are fond of such accounts and there have been books filled with nothing else to these therefore i refer the reader who may be better pleased with accounts of men with two heads or without any head of children joined in the middle of bones turned into flesh or flesh converted into bones than i am vide phil trans passim miscellan curioss johan baptist wenck dissertatio phisica an ex virilis

of these accounts is almost infinite and perhaps their use is as much circumscribed as their variety is extensive  it is sufficient here to observe that every days experience must have shown us miserable instances of this kind produced by nature or affectation calamities that no pity can soften nor assiduity relieve  passing over therefore every other account i shall only mention the famous instance quoted by father malbranche upon which he founds his beautiful theory of monstrous productions a woman of paris the wife of a tradesman went to see a criminal broke alive upon the wheel at the place of public execution she was at that time two months advanced in her pregnancy and no way subject to any disorders to affect the child in her womb she was however of a tender habit of body and though led by curiosity to this horrid spectacle very easily moved to pity and compassion she felt therefore all those strong emotions which so terrible a sight must naturally inspire shuddered at every blow the criminal received and almost swooned at his cries upon returning from this scene of blood she continued for some days pensive and her imagination still wrought upon the spectacle she had lately seen after some time however she seemed perfectly recovered from her fright and had almost forgotten her former uneasiness when the time of her delivery approached she seemed no ways mindful of her former terrors nor were her pains in labor more than usual in such circumstances but what was the amazement of her friends and assistants when the child came into the world it was found that every limb in its body was broken just like those of the malefactor and just in the same place this poor infant that had suffered the pains of life even before its coming into the world did not die but lived in an hospital in paris for twenty years after a wretched instance of the supposed power of imagination in the mother of altering and distorting the infant in the womb the manner in which malbranche reasons upon this fact is as follows the creator has established such a sympathy between the several parts of nature that we are led not only to imitate each other but also to partake in the same affections and desires the animal spirits are thus carried to the respective parts of the body to perform the same actions which we see others perform to receive in some measure their wounds and take part in their sufferings experience tells us that if we look attentively on any person severely beaten or sorely wounded the spirits immediately flow into those parts of the body which correspond to those we see in pain the more delicate the constitution the more it is thus affected the spirits making a stronger impression on the fibers of a weakly habit than of a robust one strong vigorous men see an execution without much concern while women of nicer texture are struck with horror and concern this sensibility in them must of consequence be communicated to all parts of their body and as the fibers of the child in the womb are incomparably finer than those of the mother the course of the animal spirits must consequently produce greater alterations hence every stroke given to the criminal forcibly struck the imagination of the woman and by a kind of counter stroke the delicate tender frame of the child  such is the reasoning of an ingenious man upon a fact the veracity of which many since have called in question buffon vol   p    they have allowed indeed that such a child might have been produced but have denied the cause of its deformity how could the imagination of the mother say they produce such dreadful effects upon her child she has no communication with the infant she scarce touches it in any part quite unaffected with her concerns it sleeps in security in a manner secluded by a fluid in which it swims from her that bears it with what a variety of deformities say they would all mankind be marked if all the vain and capricious desires of the mother were thus readily written upon the body of the child yet notwithstanding this plausible way of reasoning i cannot avoid still giving some credit to the variety of instances i have either read or seen upon this subject if it be a prejudice it is as old as the days of aristotle and to this day as strongly believed by the generality of mankind as ever it does not admit of a reason and indeed i can give none even why the child should in any respect resemble the father or the mother the fact we generally find to be so but why it should take the particular print of the fathers features in the womb is as hard to conceive as why it should be affected by the mothers imagination we all know what a strong effect the imagination has on those parts in particular without being able to assign a cause how this effect is produced and why the imagination may not produce the same effect in marking the child that it does in forming it i see no reason those persons whose employment it is to rear up pigeons of different colors can breed them as their expression is to a feather in fact by properly paring them they can give what color they will to any feather in any part of the body were we to reason upon this fact what could we say might it not be asserted that the egg being distinct from the body of the female cannot be influenced by it might it not be plausibly said that there is no similitude between any part of the egg and any particular feather which we expect to propagate and yet for all this the fact is known to be true and what no speculation can invalidate in the same manner a thousand various instances assure us that the child in the womb is sometimes marked by the strong affections of the mother how this is performed we know not we only see the effect without any connection between it and the cause the best physicians have allowed it and have been satisfied to submit to the experience of a number of ages but many disbelieve it because they expect a reason for every effect this however is very hard to be given while it is very easy to appear wise by pretending incredulity  among the number of monsters dwarfs and giants are usually reckoned though not perhaps with the strictest propriety since they are no way different from the rest of mankind except in stature it is a dispute however about words and therefore scarce worth contending about but there is a dispute of a more curious nature on this subject namely whether there are races of people thus very diminutive or vastly large or whether they be merely accidental varieties that now and then are seen in a country in a few persons whose bodies some external cause has contributed to lessen or enlarge  with regard to men of diminutive stature all antiquity has been unanimous in asserting their national existence homer was the first who has given us an account of the pigmy nation contending with the cranes and what poetical license might be supposed to exaggerate athenaeus has attempted seriously to confirm by historical assertion athenaeus ix   0  if we attend to these we must believe that in the internal parts of africa there are whole nations of pigmy beings not more than a foot in stature who continually wage an unequal war with the birds and beasts that inhabit the plains in which they reside some of the ancients however and strabo in particular have supposed all these accounts to be fabulous and have been more inclined to think this supposed nation of pigmies nothing more than a species of apes well known to be numerous in that part of the world with this opinion the moderns have all concurred and that diminutive race which was described as human has been long degraded into a class of animals that resemble us but very imperfectly  the existence therefore of a pigmy race of mankind being founded in error or in fable we can expect to find men of diminutive stature only by accident among men of the ordinary size of these accidental dwarfs every country and almost every village can produce numerous instances there was a time when these unfavoured children of nature were the peculiar favorites of the great and no prince or nobleman thought himself completely attended unless he had a dwarf among the number of his domestics these poor little men were kept to be laughed at or to raise the barbarous pleasure of their masters by their contrasted inferiority even in england as late as the times of king james the first the court was at one time furnished with a dwarf a giant and a jester these the king often took a pleasure in opposing to each other and often fomented quarrels among them in order to be a concealed spectator of their animosity it was a particular entertainment of the courtiers at that time to see little jeffery for so the dwarf was called ride round the lists expecting his antagonist and discovering in his actions all the marks of contemptible resolution  it was in the same spirit that peter of russia in the year    0 celebrated a marriage of dwarfs this monarch though raised by his native genius far above a barbarian was nevertheless still many degrees removed from actual refinement his pleasures therefore were of the vulgar kind and this was among the number upon a certain day which he had ordered to be proclaimed several months before he invited the whole body of his courtiers and all the foreign ambassadors to be present at the marriage of a pigmy man and woman the preparations for this wedding were not only very grand but executed in a style of barbarous ridicule he ordered that all the dwarf men and women within two hundred miles should repair to the capital and also insisted that they should be present at the ceremony for this purpose he supplied them with proper vehicles but so contrived it that one horse was seen carrying in a dozen of them into the city at once while the mob followed shouting and laughing from behind some of them were at first unwilling to obey an order which they knew was calculated to turn them into ridicule and did not come but he soon obliged them to obey and as a punishment enjoined that they should wait upon the rest at dinner the whole company of dwarfs amounted to seventy beside the bride and bridegroom who were richly adorned and in the extremity of the fashion for this little company in miniature every thing was suitably provided a low table small plates little glasses and in short every thing was so fitted as if all things had been dwindled to their own standard it was his great pleasure to see their gravity and their pride the contention of the women for places and the men for superiority this point he attempted to adjust by ordering that the most diminutive should take the lead but this bred disputes for none would then consent to sit foremost all this however being at last settled dancing followed the dinner and the ball was opened with a minuet by the bridegroom who measured exactly three feet two inches high in the end matters were so contrived that this little company who met together in gloomy pride and unwilling to be pleased being at last familiarized to laughter joined in the diversion and became as the journalist has it die dench wurdige iwerg hocksheit etc lipsiae      vol viii page  0  seq  extremely sprightly and entertaining  but whatever may be the entertainment such guests might afford when united i never found a dwarf capable of affording any when alone i have sometimes conversed with some of these that were exhibited at our fairs about town and have ever found their intellects as contracted as their persons they in general seemed to me to have faculties very much resembling those of children and their desires seemed of the same kind being diverted with the same sports and best pleased with such companions of all those i have seen which may amount to five or six the little man whose name was coan that died lately at chelsea was the most intelligent and sprightly i have heard him and the giant who sung at the theaters sustain a very ridiculous duet to which they were taught to give great spirit but this mirth and seeming sagacity were but assumed he had by long habit been taught to look cheerful upon the approach of company and his conversation was but the mere etiquette of a person that had been used to receive visitors when driven out of his walk nothing could be more stupid or ignorant nothing more dejected or forlorn but we have a complete history of a dwarf very accurately related by mr danbenton in his part of the histoire naturel which i will here take leave to translate  this dwarf whose name was baby was well known having spent the greatest part of his life at lunenville in the palace of stanislaus the exiled king of poland he was born in the village of plaisne in france in the year      his father and mother were peasants both of good constitutions and inured to a life of husbandry and labor baby when born weighed but a pound and a quarter we are not informed of the dimensions of his body at that time but we may conjecture they were very small as he was presented on a plate to be baptized and for a long time lay in a slipper his mouth although proportioned to the rest of his body was not at that time large enough to take in the nipple and he was therefore obliged to be suckled by a shegoat that was in the house and that served as a nurse attending to his cries with a kind of maternal fondness he began to articulate some words when eighteen months old and at two years he was able to walk alone he was then fitted with shoes that were about an inch and a half long he was attacked with several acute disorders but the smallpox was the only one which left any marks behind it until he was six years old he eat no other food but pulse potatoes and bacon his father and mother were from their poverty incapable of affording him any better nourishment and his education was little better than his food being bred up among the rustics of the place at six years old he was about fifteen inches high and his whole body weighed but thirteen pound notwithstanding this he was well proportioned and handsome his health was good but his understanding scarce passed the bounds of instinct it was at that time that the king of poland having heard of such a curiosity had him conveyed to lunenville gave him the name of baby and kept him in his palace  baby having thus quitted the hard condition of a peasant to enjoy all the comforts and the conveniences of life seemed to receive no alteration from his new way of living either in mind or person he preserved the goodness of his constitution till about the age of sixteeen but his body seemed to increase very slowly during the whole time and his stupidity was such that all instructions were lost in improving his understanding he could never be brought to have any sense of religion nor even to show the least signs of a reasoning faculty they attempted to teach him dancing and music but in vain he never could make any thing of music and as for dancing although he beat time tolerably exact yet he could never remember the figure but while his dancing master stood by to direct his motions notwithstanding a mind thus destitute of understanding was not without its passions anger and jealousy harrassed it at times nor was he without desires of another nature  at the age of sixteen baby was twentynine inches tall at this he rested but having thus arrived at his acme the alterations of puberty or rather perhaps of old age came fast upon him from being very beautiful the poor little creature now became quite deformed his strength quite forsook him his back bone began to bend his head hung forward his legs grew weak one of his shoulders turned awry and his nose grew disproportionably large with his strength his natural spirits also forsook him and by the time he was twenty he was grown feeble decrepid and marked with the strongest impressions of old age it had been before remarked by some that he would die of old age before he arrived at thirty and in fact by the time he was twentytwo he could scarcely walk an hundred paces being worn with the multiplicity of his years and bent under the burden of protracted life in this year he died a cold attended with a slight fever threw him into a kind of lethargy which had a few momentary intervals but he could scarce be brought to speak however it is asserted that in the five last days of his life he showed a clearer understanding than in his times of best health but at length he died after enduring great agonies in the twentysecond year of his age  opposite to this accidental diminution of the human race is that of its extraordinary magnitude concerning the reality of a nation of giants there have been many disputes among the learned some have affirmed the probability of such a race and others as warmly have denied the possibility of their existence but it is not from any speculative reasonings upon a subject of this kind that information is to be obtained it is not from the disputes of the scholar but the labors of the enterprizing that we are to be instructed in this enquiry indeed nothing can be more absurd than what some learned men have advanced upon this subject it is very unlikely says grew that there should either be dwarfs or giants or if such they cannot be fitted for the usual enjoyment of life and reason had man been born a dwarf he could scarce have been a reasonable creature for to that end he must have a jolt head and then he would not have body and blood enough to supply his brain with spirits or if he had a small head proportionable to his body there would not be brain enough for conducting life but it is still worse with giants and there could never have been a nation of such for there would not be food enough found in any country to sustain them or if there were beasts sufficient for this purpose there would not be grass enough for their maintenance but what is still more add others giants could never be able to support the weight of their own bodies since a man of ten feet high must be eight times as heavy as one of the ordinary stature whereas he has but twice the size of muscles to support such a burden and consequently would be overloaded with the weight of his own body such are the theories upon this subject and they require no other answer but that experience proves them both to be false dwarfs are found capable of life and reason and giants are seen to carry their own bodies we have several accounts from mariners that a nation of giants actually exists and mere speculation should never induce us to doubt their veracity  ferdinand magellan was the first who discovered this race of people along the coast toward the extremity of south america magellan was a portuguese of noble extraction who having long behaved with great bravery under albukerk the conqueror of india he was treated with neglect by the court upon his return applying therefore to the king of spain he was entrusted with the command of five ships to take and subdue the molucca islands upon one of which he was slain it was in his voyage thither that he happened to winter in st julians bay an american harbor fortynine degrees south of the line in this desolate region where nothing was seen but objects of terror where neither trees nor verdure dressed the face of the country they remained for some months without seeing any human creature they had judged the country to be utterly uninhabitable when one day they saw approaching as if he had been dropped from the clouds a man of enormous stature dancing and singing and putting dust upon his head as they supposed in token of peace this overture for friendship was by magellans command quickly answered by the rest of his men and the giant approaching testified every mark of astonishment and surprise he was so tall that the spaniards only reached his waist his face was broad his color brown and painted over with a variety of tints each cheek had the resemblance of an heart drawn upon it his hair was approaching to whiteness he was clothed in skins and armed with a bow being treated with kindness and dismissed with some trifling presents he soon returned with many more of the same stature two of whom the mariners decoyed on shipboard nothing could be more gentle than they were in the beginning they considered the fetters that were preparing for them as ornaments and played with them like children with their toys but when they found for what purpose they were intended they instantly exerted their amazing strength and broke them in pieces with a very easy effort this account with a variety of other circumstances has been confirmed by succeeding travelers herrera sebald were oliver van noort and james le maire all correspond in affirming the fact although they differ in many particulars of their respective descriptions the last voyager we have had that has seen this enormous race is commodore byron i have talked with the person who first gave the relation of that voyage and who was the carpenter of the commodores ship he was a sensible understanding man and i believe extremely faithful by him therefore i was assured in the most solemn manner of the truth of his relation and this account has since been confirmed by one or two publications in all which the particulars are pretty nearly the same one of the circumstances which most puzzled me to reconcile to probability was that of the horses on which they are described as riding down to the shore we know the american horse to be of european breed and in some measure to be degenerated from the original i was at a loss therefore to account how an horse of not more than fourteen hands high was capable of carrying a man of nine feet or in other words an animal almost as large as itself but the wonder will cease when we consider that so small a beast as an ass will carry a man of ordinary size tolerably well and the proportion between this and the former instance is tolerably exact we can no longer therefore refuse our assent to the existence of this gigantic race of mankind in what manner they are propagated or under what regulations they live is a subject that remains for future investigation it should appear however that they are a wandering nation changing their abode with the course of the sun and shifting their situation for the convenience of food climate or pasture  this race of giants are described as possessed of great strength and no doubt they must be very different from those accidental giants that are to be seen in different parts of europe stature with these seems rather their infirmity than their pride and adds to their burden without increasing their strength of those i have seen the generality were illformed and unhealthful weak in their persons or incapable of exerting what strength they were possessed of the same defects of understanding that attended those of suppressed stature were found in those who were thus overgrown they were heavy phlegmatic stupid and inclined to sadness their numbers however are but few and it is thus kindly ordered by providence that as the middle state is the best fitted for happiness so the middle ranks of mankind are produced in the greatest variety  however mankind seems naturally to have a respect for men of extraordinary stature and it has been a supposition of long standing that our ancestors were much taller as well as much more beautiful than we this has been indeed a theme of poetical declamation from the beginning and man was scarce formed when he began to deplore an imaginary decay nothing is more natural than this progress of the mind in looking up to antiquity with reverential wonder having been accustomed to compare the wisdom of our fathers with our own in early imbecility the impression of their superiority remains when they no longer exist and when we cease to be inferior thus the men of every age consider the past as wiser than the present and the reverence seems to accumulate as our imaginations ascend for this reason we allow remote antiquity many advantages without disputing their title the inhabitants of uncivilized countries represent them as taller and stronger and the people of a more polished nation as more healthy and more wise nevertheless these attributes seem to be only the prejudices of ingenuous minds a kind of gratitude which we hope in turn to receive from posterity the ordinary stature of men mr derham observes is in all probability the same now as at the beginning the oldest measure we have of the human figure is in the monument of cheops in the first pyramid of egypt this must have subsisted many hundred years before the times of homer who is the first that deplores the decay this monument however scarce exceeds the measure of our ordinary coffins the cavity is no more than six feet long two feet wide and deep in about the same proportion several mummies also of a very early age are found to be only of the ordinary stature and show that for these three thousand years at least men have not suffered the least diminution we have many corroborating proofs of this in the ancient pieces of armor which are dug up in different parts of europe the brass helmet dug up at medauro fits one of our men and yet is allowed to have been left there at the overthrow of asdrubal some of our finest antique statues which we learn from pliny and others to be exactly as big as the life still continue to this day remaining monuments of the superior excellence of their workmen indeed but not of the superiority of their stature we may conclude therefore that men have been in all ages pretty much of the same size they are at present and that the only difference must have been accidental or perhaps national  as to the superior beauty of our ancestors it is not easy to make the comparison beauty seems a very uncertain charm and frequently is less in the object than in the eye of the beholder were a modern ladys face formed exactly like the venus of medicis or the sleeping vestal she would scarce be considered beautiful except by the lovers of antiquity whom of all her admirers perhaps she would be least desirous of pleasing it is true that we have some disorders among us that disfigure the features and from which the ancients were exempt but it is equally so that we want some which were common among them and which were equally deforming as for their intellectual powers these also were probably the same as ours we excel them in the sciences which may be considered as an history of accumulated experience and they excel us in the poetic arts as they had the first rifling of all the striking images of nature  chap xii of mummies waxworks etc man this chapter i have in a great measure translated from mr daubenton whatever is added from others is marked with inverted commas is not content with the usual term of life but he is willing to lengthen out his existence by art and although he cannot prevent death he tries to obviate his dissolution it is natural to attempt to preserve even the most trifling relics of what has long given us pleasure nor does the mind separate from the body without a wish that even the wretched heap of dust it leaves behind may yet be remembered the embalming practiced in various nations probably had its rise in this fond desire an urn filled with ashes among the romans served as a pledge of continuing affection and even the grassy graves in our own church yards are raised above the surface with the desire that the body below should not be wholly forgotten the soul ardent after eternity for itself is willing to procure even for the body a prolonged duration  but of all nations the egyptians carried this art to the highest perfection as it was a principle of their religion to suppose the soul continued only coeval to the duration of the body they tried every art to extend the life of the one by preventing the dissolution of the other in this practice they were exercised from the earliest ages and the mummies they have embalmed in this manner continue in great numbers to the present day we are told in genesis that joseph seeing his father expire gave orders to his physicians to embalm the body which they executed in the compass of forty days which was the usual time of embalming herodotus also the most ancient of the profane historians gives us a copious detail of this art as it was practiced in his time among the egyptians there are certain men among them says he who practice embalming as a trade which they perform with all expedition possible in the first place they draw out the brain through the nostrils with irons adapted to this purpose and in proportion as they evacuate it in this manner they fill up the cavity with aromatics they next cut open the belly near the sides with a sharpened stone and take out the entrails which they cleanse and wash in palm oil having performed this operation they roll them in aromatic powder fill them with myrrh cassia and other perfumes except incense and replace them sewing up the body again after these precautions they salt the body with nitre and keep it in the saltingplace for seventy days it not being permitted to preserve it so any longer when the seventy days are accomplished and the body washed once more they swathe it in bands made of linen which have been dipped in a gum the egyptians use instead of salt when the friends have taken back the body they make an hollow trough something like the shape of a man in which they place the body and this they enclose in a box preserving the whole as a most precious relick placed against the wall such are the ceremonies used with regard to the rich as for those who are contented with an humbler preparation they treat them as follows they fill a syringe with an odoriferous liquor extracted from the cedar tree and without making any incision inject it up the body of the deceased and then keep it in nitre as long as in the former case when the time is expired they evacuate the body of the cedar liquor which had been injected and such is the effect of this operation that the liquor dissolves the intestines and brings them away the nitre also serves to eat away the flesh and leaves only the skin and the bones remaining this done the body is returned to the friends and the embalmer takes no farther trouble about it the third method of embalming those of the meanest condition is merely by purging and cleansing the intestines by frequent injections and preserving the body for a similar term in nitre at the end of which it is restored to the relations  diodorus siculus also makes mention of the manner in which these embalmings are performed according to him there were several officers appointed for this purpose the first of them who was called the scribe marked those parts of the body on the left side which were to be opened the cutter made the incision and one of those that were to salt it drew out all the bowels except the heart and the kidneys another washed them in palmwine and odoriferous liquors afterward they anointed for above thirty days with cedar gum myrrh cinnamon and other perfumes these aromatics preserved the body entire for a long time and gave it a very agreeable odor it was not in the least disfigured by this preparation after which it was returned to the relations who kept it in a coffin placed upright against the wall  most of the modern writers who have treated on this subject have merely repeated what has been said by herodotus and if they add any thing of their own it is but merely from conjecture dumont observes that it is very probable that aloes bitumen and cinnamon make a principal part of the composition which is used on this occasion he adds that after embalming the body is put into a coffin made of the sycamoretree which is almost incorruptible mr grew remarks that in an egyptian mummy in the possession of the royal society the preparation was so penetrating as to enter into the very substance of the bones and rendered them so black that they seemed to have been burnt from this he is induced to believe that the egyptians had a custom of embalming their dead by boiling them in a kind of liquid preparation until all the aqueous parts of the body were exhaled away and until the oily or gummy matter had penetrated throughout he proposes in consequence of this a method of macerating and afterward of boiling the dead body in oil of walnut  i am for my own part of opinion that there were several ways of preserving dead bodies from putrefaction and that this would be no difficult matter since different nations have all succeeded in the attempt we have an example of this kind among the guanches the ancient inhabitants of the island of teneriff those who survived the general destruction of this people by the spaniards when they conquered this island informed them that the art of embalming was still preserved there and that there was a tribe of priests among them possessed of the secret which they kept concealed as a sacred mystery as the greatest part of the nation was destroyed the spaniards could not arrive at a complete knowledge of this art they only found out a few of the particulars having taken out the bowels they washed the body several times in a lee made of the dried bark of the pine tree warmed during the summer by the sun or by a stove in the winter they afterward anointed it with butter or the fat of bears which they had previously boiled with odoriferous herbs such as sage and lavender after this unction they suffered the body to dry and then repeated the operation as often as it was necessary until the whole substance was impregnated with the preparation when it was become very light it was then a certain sign that it was fit and properly prepared they then rolled it up in the dried skins of goats which when they had a mind to save expense they suffered to remain with the hair still growing upon them purchase assures us that he has seen mummies of this kind in london and mentions the name of a gentleman who had seen several of them in the island of teneriff which were supposed to have been two thousand years old but without any certain proofs of such great antiquity this people who probably came first from the coasts of africa might have learned this art from the egyptians as there was a traffic carried on from thence into the most internal parts of africa  father acosta and garcilasso de la vega make no doubt but that the peruvians understood the art of preserving their dead for a very long space of time they assert their having seen the bodies of several incas that were perfectly preserved they still preserved their hair and their eyebrows but they had eyes made of gold put in the places of those taken out they were clothed in their usual habits and seated in the manner of the indians their arms placed on their breasts garcilasso touched one of their fingers and found it apparently as hard as wood and the whole body was not heavy enough to overburthen a weak man who should attempt to carry it away acosta presumes that these bodies were embalmed with a bitumen of which the indians knew the properties garcilasso however is of a different opinion as he saw nothing bituminous about them but he confesses that he did not examine them very particularly and he regrets his not having enquired into the methods used for that purpose he adds that being a peruvian his countrymen would not have scrupled to inform him of the secret if they really had it still among them  garcilasso thus being ignorant of the secret makes use of some inductions to throw light upon the subject he asserts that the air is so dry and so cold at cusco that flesh dries there like wood without corrupting and he is of opinion that they dried the body in snow before they applied the bitumen he adds that in the times of the incas they usually dried the flesh which was designed for the ammunition of the army and that when they had lost their humidity they might be kept without salt or any other preparation  it is said that at spitsbergen which lies within the artic circle and consequently in the coldest climate bodies never corrupt nor suffer any apparent alteration even though buried for thirty years nothing corrupts or putrifies in that climate the wood which has been employed in building those houses where the trainoil is separated appears as fresh as the day they were first cut  if excessive cold therefore be thus capable of preserving bodies from corruption it is not less certain that a great degree of dryness produced by heat produces the same effect it is well known that the men and animals that are buried in the sands of arabia quickly dry up and continue in preservation for several ages as if they had been actually embalmed it has often happened that whole caravans have perished in crossing those deserts either by the burning winds that infest them or by the sands which are raised by the tempest and overwhelm every creature in certain ruin the bodies of those persons are preserved entire and they are often found in this condition by some accidental passenger many authors both ancient and modern make mention of such mummies as these and shaw says that he has been assured that numbers of men as well as other animals have been thus preserved for times immemorial in the burning sands of saibah which is a place he supposes situate between rasem and egypt  the corruption of dead bodies being entirely caused by the fermentation of the humors whatever is capable of hindering or retarding this fermentation will contribute to their preservation both heat and cold though so contrary in themselves produce similar effects in this particular by drying up the humors the cold in condensing and thickening them and the heat in evaporating them before they have time to act upon the solids but it is necessary that these extremes should be constant for if they succeed each other so as that cold shall follow heat or dryness humidity it must then necessarily happen that corruption must ensue however in temperate climates there are natural causes capable of preserving dead bodies among which we may reckon the qualities of the earth in which they are buried if the earth be drying and astringent it will imbibe the humidity of the body and it may be probably for this reason that the bodies buried in the monastery of the cordeliers at thoulouse do not putrify but dry in such a manner that one may lift them up by one arm  the gums resins and bitumens with which dead bodies are embalmed keep off the impressions which they would else receive from the alteration of the temperature of the air and still more if a body thus prepared be placed in a dry or burning sand the most powerful means will be united for its preservation we are not to be surprised therefore at what we are told by chardin of the county of chorosan in persia the bodies which have been previously embalmed and buried in the sands of that country as he assures us are found to petrify or in other words to become extremely hard and are preserved for several ages it is asserted that some of them have continued for a thousand years  the egyptians as has been mentioned above swathed the body with linen bands and enclosed it in a coffin however it is probable that with all these precautions they would not have continued till now if the tombs or pits in which they were placed had not been dug in a dry chalky soil which was not susceptible of humidity and which was besides covered over with a dry sand of several feet thickness  the sepulchers of the ancient egyptians subsist to this day most travelers who have been in egypt have described those of ancient mummies and have seen the mummies interred there these catacombs are within two leagues of the ruins of this city nine leagues from grand cairo and about two miles from the village of zaccara they extend from thence to the pyramids of pharaoh which are about eight miles distant these sepulchers lie in a field covered with a fine running sand of a yellowish color the country is dry and hilly the entrance of the tomb is choked up with sand there are many open but several more that are still concealed the inhabitants of the neighboring village have no other commerce or method of subsisting but by seeking out mummies and selling them to such strangers as happen to be at grand cairo this commerce some years ago was not only a very common but a very gainful one a complete mummy was often sold for twenty pounds but it must not be supposed that it was bought at such an high price from a mere passion for antiquity there were much more powerful motives for this traffic mummy at that time made a considerable article in medicine and a thousand imaginary virtues were ascribed to it for the cure of most disorders particularly of the paralytic kind there was no shop therefore without mummy in it and no physician thought he had properly treated his patient without adding this to his prescription induced by the general repute in which this supposed drug was at that time several jews both of italy and france found out the art of imitating mummy so exactly that they for a long time deceived all europe this they did by drying dead bodies in ovens after having prepared them with myrrh aloes and bitumen still however the request for mummies continued and a variety of cures were daily ascribed to them at length paraeus wrote a treatise on their total inefficacy in physic and showed their abuse in loading the stomach to the exclusion of more efficacious medicines from that time therefore their reputation began to decline the jews discontinued their counterfeits and the trade returned entire to the egyptians when it was of no longer value the industry of seeking after mummies is now totally relaxed their price merely arbitrary and just what the curious are willing to give  in seeking for mummies they first clear away the sand which they may do for weeks together without finding what they want upon coming to a little square opening of about eighteen feet in depth they descend into it by holes for the feet placed at proper intervals and there they are sure of finding what they seek for these caves or wells as they call them there are hollowed out of a white freestone which is found in all this country a few feet below the covering of sand when one gets to the bottom of these which are sometimes forty feet below the surface there are several square openings on each side into passages of ten or fifteen feet wide and these lead to chambers of fifteen or twenty feet square these are all hewn out into the rock and in each of the catacombs are to be found several of these apartments communicating with each other they extend a great way under ground so as to be under the city of memphis and in a manner to undermine its environs  in some of the chambers the walls are adorned with figures and hieroglyphics in others the mummies are found in tombs round the apartment hollowed out in the rock these tombs are upright and cut into the shape of a man with his arms stretched out there are still others found and these in the greatest number in wooden coffins or in clothes covered with bitumen these coffins or wrappers are all over covered with a variety of ornaments there are some of them painted and are adorned with figures such as that of death and the leaden seals on which several characters are engraven some of these coffins are carved into the human shape but the head alone is distinguishable the rest of the body is all of a piece and terminated by a pedestal while there are some with their arms hanging down and it is by these marks that the bodies of persons of rank are distinguished from those of the meaner order these are generally found lying on the floor without any profusion of ornaments and in some chambers the mummies are found indiscriminately piled upon each other and buried in the sand  many mummies are found lying on their backs their heads turned to the north and the hands placed on the belly the bands of linen with which these are swathed are found to be more than a thousand yards long and of consequence the number of circumvolutions they make about the body must have been amazing these were performed by beginning at the head and ending at the feet but they contrived it so as to avoid covering the face however when the face is entirely uncovered it moulders into dust immediately upon the admission of the air when therefore it is preserved entire a slight covering of cloth is so disposed over it as that the shape of the eye the nose and the mouth are seen under it some mummies have been found with a long beard and hair that reached down to the midleg nails of a surprising length and some gilt or at least painted of a gold color some are found with bands upon the breast covered with hieroglyphics in gold silver or in green and some with tutelary idols and other figures of jasper within their body a piece of gold also has often been found under their tongues of about two pistoles value and for this reason the arabians spoil all the mummies they meet with in order to get at the gold  but although art or accident has thus been found to preserve dead bodies entire it must by no means be supposed that it is capable of preserving the exact form and lineaments of the deceased person those bodies which are found dried away in the deserts or in some particular churchyards are totally deformed and scarce any lineaments remain of their external structure nor are the mummies preserved by embalming in a better condition the flesh is dried away hardened and hidden under a variety of bandages the bowels as we have seen are totally removed and from hence in the most perfect of them we see only a shapeless mass of skin discolored and even the features scarce distinguishable the art is therefore an effort rather of preserving the substance than the likeness of the deceased and has consequently not been brought to its highest pitch of perfection it appears from a mummy not long since dug up in france that the art of embalming was more completely understood in the western world than even in egypt itself this mummy which was dug up at auvergne was an amazing instance of their skill and is one of the most curious relics in the art of preservation as some peasants in that part of the world were digging in a field near rion within about twentysix paces of the highway between that and the river artier they discovered a tomb that was about a foot and a half beneath the surface it was composed only of two stones one of which formed the body of the sepulcher and the other the cover this tomb was of freestone seven feet and an half long three feet and a half broad and about three feet high it was of rude workmanship the cover had been polished but was without figure or inscription within this tomb was placed a leaden coffin four feet seven inches long fourteen inches broad and fifteen high it was not made coffin fashion but oblong like a box equally broad at both ends and covered with a lid that fitted on like a snuff box without an hinge this cover had two holes in it each of about two inches long and very narrow filled with a substance resembling butter but for what purpose intended remains unknown within this coffin was a mummy in the highest and most perfect preservation the internal sides of the coffin were filled with an aromatic substance mingled with clay round the mummy was wrapped a coarse cloth in form of a napkin under this were two shirts or shrouds of the most exquisite texture beneath these a bandage which covered all parts of the body like an infant in swaddling clothes still under this general bandage there was another which went particularly round the extremities the hands and the legs the head was covered with two caps the feet and hands were without any particular bandages and the whole body was covered with an aromatic substance an inch thick when these were removed and the body exposed naked to view nothing could be more astonishing than the preservation of the whole and the exact resemblance it bore to a body that had but just been dead a day or two before it appeared well proportioned except that the head was rather large and the feet small the skin had all the pliancy and color of a body lately dead the visage however was of a brownish hue the belly yielded to the touch all the joints were flexible except those of the legs and feet the fingers stretched forth of themselves when bent inwards the nails still continued perfect and all the marks of the joints both in the fingers the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet remained perfectly visible the bones of the arms and legs were soft and pliant but on the contrary those of the skull preserved their rigidity the hair which only covered the back of the head was of a chestnut color and about two inches long the pericranum at top was separated from the skull by an incision in order to open that for the introducing proper aromatics in the place of the brain where they were found mixed with clay the teeth the tongue and the ears were all preserved in perfect form the intestines were not taken out of the body but remained pliant and entire as in a fresh subject and the breast was made to rise and fall like a pair of bellows the embalming preparation had a very strong and pungent smell which the body preserved for more than a month after it was exposed to the air this odor was perceived whenever the mummy was laid although it remained there but a very short time it was even pretended that the peasants of the neighboring villages were incommoded by it if one touched either the mummy or any part of the preparation the hands smelt of it for several hours after although washed with water spirit of wine or vinegar this mummy having remained exposed for some months to the curiosity of the public began to suffer some mutilations a part of the skin of the forehead was cut off all its teeth were drawn out and some attempts were made to pull away the tongue it was therefore put into a glasscase and shortly after transmitted to the king of frances cabinet at paris  there are many reasons to believe this to be the body of a person of the highest distinction however no marks remain to assure us either of the quality of the person or the time of his decease there only are to be seen some irregular figures on the coffin one of which represents a kind of star there were also some singular characters upon the bandages which were totally defaced by those who had torn them away however it should seem that it had remained for several ages in this state since the first years immediately succeeding the interment are usually those in which the body is most liable to decay it appears also to be a much more perfect method of embalming than that of the egyptians as in this the flesh continues with its natural elasticity and color the bowels remain entire and the joints have almost the pliancy which they had when the person was alive upon the whole it is probable that a much less tedious preparation than that used by the egyptians would have sufficed to keep the body from putrefaction and that an injection of petreoleum inwardly and a layer of asphaltum without would have sufficed to have made a mummy and it is remarkable that auvergne where this was found affords these two substances in sufficient plenty this art therefore might be brought to greater perfection than it has arrived at hitherto were the art worth preserving but mankind have long since grown wiser in this respect and are contented no longer to keep by them a deformed carcass which instead of aiding their magnificence must only serve to mortify their pride  chap xiii of animals leaving man we now descend to the lower ranks of animated nature and prepare to examine the life manners and characters of these our humble partners in the creation but in such a wonderful variety as is diffused around us where shall we begin the number of beings endued with life as well as we seems at first view infinite not only the forest the waters the air teems with animals of various kinds but almost every vegetable every leaf has millions of minute inhabitants each of which fill up the circle of its allotted life and some of which are found objects of the greatest curiosity in this seeming exuberance of animals it is natural enough for ignorance to lie down in hopeless uncertainty and to declare what requires labor to particularize to be utterly inscrutable it is otherwise however with the active and searching mind no way intimidated with the immense variety it begins the task of numbering grouping and classing all the various kind that fall within its notice finds every day new relations between the several parts of the creation acquires the art of considering several at a time under one point of view and at last begins to find that the variety is neither so great nor so inscrutable as was at first imagined as in a clear night the number of the stars seems infinite yet if we sedulously attend to each in its place and regularly class them they will soon be found to diminish and come within a very scanty computation  method therefore is one of the principal helps in natural history and without it very little progress can be made in this science it is by that alone we can hope to dissipate that glare if i may so express it that arises from a multiplicity of objects at once presenting themselves to the view it is method that fixes the attention to one point and leads it by slow and certain degrees to leave no part of nature unobserved  all naturalists therefore have been very careful in adopting some method of classing or grouping the several parts of nature and some have written books of natural history with no other view these methodical divisions some have treated with contempt mr buffon in his introduction etc  not considering that books in general are written with opposite views some to be read and some only to be occasionally consulted the methodists in natural history seem to be content with the latter advantage and have sacrificed to order alone all the delights of the subject all the arts of heightening awakening or continuing curiosity but they certainly have the same use in science that a dictionary has in language but with this difference that in a dictionary we proceed from the name to the definition in a system of natural history we proceed from the definition to find out the thing without the aid of system nature must still have lain undistinguished like furniture in a lumber room every thing we wish for is there indeed but we know not where to find it if for instance in a morning excursion i find a plant or an insect the name of which i desire to learn or perhaps am curious to know whether already known in this enquiry i can expect information only from one of these systems which being couched in a methodical form quickly directs me to what i seek for thus we will suppose that our enquirer has met with a spider and that he has never seen such an insect before he is taught by the writer of a system linnaeus to examine whether it has wings and he finds that it has none he therefore is to look for it among the wingless insects or the aptera as he calls them he then is to see whether the head and breast make one part of the body or are disunited he finds they make one he is then to reckon the number of feet and eyes and he finds that it has eight of each the insect therefore must be either a scorpion or a spider but he lastly examines its feelers which he finds clavated or clubbed and by all these marks he at last discovers it to be a spider of spiders there are fortyseven sorts and by reading the description of each the enquirer will learn the name of that which he desires to know with the name of the insect he is also directed to those authors that have given any account of it and the page where that account is to be found by this means he may know at once what has been said of that animal by others and what there is of novelty in the result of his own researches  from hence therefore it will appear how useful those systems in natural history are to the enquirer but having given them all their merit it would be wrong not to observe that they have in general been very much abused their authors in general seem to think that they are improvers of natural history when in reality they are but guides they seem to boast that they are adding to our knowledge while they are only arranging it these authors also seem to think that the reading of their works and systems is the best method to attain a knowledge of nature but setting aside the impossibility of getting through whole volumes of a dry long catalogue the multiplicity of whose contents is too great for even the strongest memory such works rather tell us the names than the history of the creature we desire to enquire after in these dreary pages every insect or plant that has a name makes as distinguished a figure as the most wonderful or the most useful the true end of studying nature is to make a just selection to find those parts of it that most conduce to our pleasure or convenience and to leave the rest in greater neglect but these systems employing the same degree of attention upon all give us no opportunities of knowing which most deserves attention and he who has made his knowledge from such systems only has his memory crowded with a number of trifling or minute particulars which it should be his business and his labor to forget these books as was said before are useful to be consulted but they are very unnecessary to be read no enquirer in nature should be without one of them and without any doubt linnaeus deserves the preference  one fault more in almost all these systematic writers and that which leads me to the subject of the present chapter is that seeing the necessity of methodical distribution in some parts of nature they have introduced it into all finding the utility of arranging plants birds or insects they have arranged quadrupedes also with the same assiduity and although the number of these is so few as not to reach two hundred they have darkened the subject with distinctions and divisions which only serve to puzzle and perplex all method is only useful in giving perspicuity where the subject is either dark or copious but with regard to quadrupedes the number is but few many of them we are well acquainted with by habit and the rest may very readily be known without any method in treating of such therefore it would be useless to confound the reader with a multiplicity of divisions as quadrupedes are conspicuous enough to obtain the second rank in nature it becomes us to be acquainted with at least the names of them all however as there are naturalists who have gained a name from the excellence of their methods in classing these animals some readers may desire to have a knowledge of what has been laboriously invented for their instruction i will just take leave therefore to mention the most applauded methods of classing animals as adopted by ray klein and linnaeus for it often happens that the terms which have been long used in a science though frivolous become by prescription a part of the science itself  ray after aristotle divides all animals into two kinds those which have blood and those which are bloodless in the last class he places all the insect tribes the former he divides into such as breathe through the lungs and such as breathe through gills these last comprehend the fishes in those which breathe through the lungs some have the heart composed of two ventricles and some have it of one of the last are all animals of the cetaceous kind all oviparous quadrupedes and serpents of those that have two ventricles some are oviparous which are the birds and some viviparous which are quadrupedes the quadrupedes he divides into such as have an hoof and such as are clawfooted those with the hoof he divides into such as have it undivided such as have it cloven and such as have the hoof divided into more parts as the rhinoceros and hippopotamos animals with the cloven hoof he divides into such as chew the cud such as the cow and the sheep and such as are not ruminant as the hog he divides those animals that chew the cud into four kinds the first have hollow horns which they never shed as the cow the second is of a less species and is of the sheep kind the third is of the goat kind and the last which have solid horns and shed them annually are of the deer kind coming to the clawfooted animals he finds some with large claws resembling the fingers of the human hand and these he makes the ape kind of the others some have the foot divided in two and have a claw to each division these are the camel kind the elephant makes a kind by itself as its claws are covered over by a skin the rest of the numerous tribe of clawfooted animals he divides into two kinds the analogous or such as resemble each other and the anomalous which differ from the rest the analogous clawfooted animals are of two kinds they have more than two cutting teeth in each jaw such as the lion and the dog which are carnivorous or they have but two cutting teeth in each jaw and these are chiefly fed upon vegetables the carnivorous kinds are divided into the great and the little the great carnivorous animals are divided into such as have a short snout as the cat and the lion and such as have it long and pointed as the dog and the wolf the little clawfooted carnivorous animals differ from the great in having a proportionably smaller head and a slender body that fits them for creeping into holes in pursuit of their prey like worms and they are therefore called the vermin kind  we see from this sketch of division and subdivision how a subject extremely delightful and amusing in itself may be darkened and rendered disgusting but notwithstanding ray seems to be one of the most simple distributors and his method is still and not without reason adopted by many such as have been at the trouble to learn this method will certainly find it useful nor would we be thought in the least to take from its merits all we contend for is that the same information may be obtained by a pleasanter and an easier method  it was the great success of rays method that soon after produced such a variety of attempts in the same manner but almost all less simple and more obscure mr kleins method is briefly as follows he makes the power of changing place the characteristic mark of animals in general and he takes their distinctions from their aptitude and fitness for such a change some change place by means of feet or some similar contrivance others have wings and feet some can change place only in water and have only fins some go upon earth without any feet at all some change place by moving their shell and some move only at a certain time of the year of such however as do not move at all he takes no notice the quadrupedes that move chiefly by means of four feet upon land he divides into two orders the first are the hoofed kind and the second the claw kind each of these orders is divided into four families the first family of the hoofed kind are the single hoofed such as the horse ass etc the second family are such as have the hoof cloven into two parts such as the cow etc the third family have the hoof divided into three parts and in this family is found only the rhinoceros the fourth family have the hoof divided into five parts and in this is only to be found the elephant with respect to the clawed kind the first family comprehends those that have but two claws on each foot as the camel the second family have three claws the third four and the fourth five this method of taking the distinctions of animals from the organs of motion is ingenious but it is at the same time incomplete and besides the divisions into which it must necessarily fall is inadequate since for instance in his family with two claws there is but one animal whereas in his family with five claws there are above an hundred  brisson who has labored this subject with great accuracy divides animated nature into nine classes namely quadrupedes cetaceous animals or those of the whale kind birds reptiles or those of the serpent kind cartilaginous fishes spinous fishes shelled animals insects and worms he divides the quadrupedes into eighteen orders and takes their distinctions from the number and form of their teeth  but of all those whose systems have been adopted and admired linnaeus is the foremost as with a studied brevity his system comprehends the greatest variety in the smallest space  according to him the first distinction of animals is to be taken from their internal structure some have the heart with two ventricles and hot red blood namely quadrupedes and birds the quadrupedes are viviparous and the birds oviparous  some have the heart with but one ventricle and cold red blood namely amphibia and fishes the amphibia are furnished with lungs the fishes with gills  some have the heart with one ventricle and cold white serum namely insects and worms the insects have feelers and the worms holders  the distinctions of quadrupedes or animals with paps as he calls them are taken from their teeth he divides them into seven orders to which he gives names that are not easy of translation primates or principals with four cutting teeth in each jaw bruta or brutes with no cutting teeth ferae or wild beasts with generally six cutting teeth in each jaw glires or dormice with two cutting teeth both above and below pecora or cattle with many cutting teeth above and none below belluae or beasts with the fore teeth blunt cete or those of the whale kind with cartilaginous teeth i have but just sketched out this system as being in its own nature the closest abridgment it would take volumes to dilate it to its proper length the names of the different animals and their classes alone makes two thick octavo volumes and yet nothing is given but the slightest description of each i have omitted all criticism also upon the accuracy of the preceding systems this has been done both by buffon and daubenton not with less truth than humor for they had too much good sense not to see the absurdity of multiplying the terms of science to no end and disappointing our curiosity rather with a catalogue of natures varieties than an history of nature  instead therefore of taxing the memory and teizing the patience with such a variety of divisions and subdivisions i will take leave to class the productions of nature in the most obvious though not in the most accurate manner in natural history of all other sciences there is the least danger of obscurity in morals or in metaphysics every definition must be precise because those sciences are built upon definitions but it is otherwise in those subjects where the exhibition of the object itself is always capable of correcting the error thus it may often happen that in a lax system of natural history a creature may be ranked among quadrupedes that belongs more properly to the fish or the insect classes but that can produce very little confusion and every reader can thus make a system the most agreeable to his own imagination it will be of no manner of consequence whether we call a bird or an insect a quadrupede if we are careful in marking all its distinctions the uncertainty in reasoning or thinking that these approximations of the different kinds of animals produce is but very small and happens but very rarely whereas the labor that naturalists have been at to keep the kinds asunder had been excessive this in general has given birth to that variety of systems which we have just mentioned each of which seems to be almost as good as the preceding  taking therefore this latitude and using method only where it contributes to conciseness or perspicuity we shall divide animated nature into four classes namely quadrupedes birds fishes and insects all these seem in general pretty well distinguished from each other by nature yet there are several instances in which we can scarce tell whether it is a bird or a quadrupede that we are about to examine whether it is a fish or an insect that offers to our curiosity nature is varied by imperceptible gradations so that no line can be drawn between any two classes of its productions and no definition made to comprehend them all however the distinctions between these classes are sufficiently marked in general and their encroachments upon each other are so rare that it will be sufficient particularly to apprize the reader when they happen to be blended  there are many quadrupedes that we are well acquainted with and of those we do not know we shall form the most clear and distinct conceptions by being told wherein they differ and wherein they resemble those with which we are familiar each class of quadrupedes may be ranged under some one of the domestic kinds that may serve for the model by which we are to form some kind of idea of the rest thus we may say that a tiger is of the cat kind a wolf of the dog kind because there are some rude resemblances between each and a person who has never seen the wild animals will have some incomplete knowledge of their figure from the tame ones on the contrary i will not as some systematic writers have done linnaei syst  say that a bat is of the human kind or an hog of the horse kind merely because there is some resemblance in their teeth or their paps for although this resemblance may be striking enough yet a person who has never seen a bat or a hog will never form any just conception of either by being told of this minute similitude in short the method in classing quadrupedes should be taken from their most striking resemblances and where these resemblances do not offer we should not force the similitude but leave the animal to be described as a solitary species by itself the number of quadrupedes is so few that indeed without any method whatsoever there is no great danger of confusion  all quadrupedes the number of which according to buffon amounts to but two hundred may be classed in the following manner  first those of the horse kind this class contains the horse the ass and the zebra of these none have horns and their hoof is of one solid piece  the second class are those of the cow kind comprehending the urus the buffalo the bison and the bonassas these have cloven hoofs and chew the cud  the third class is that of the sheep kind with cloven hoofs and chewing the cud like the former in this is comprehended the sheep the goat the lama the vigogne the gazella the guinea deer and all of a similar form  the fourth class is that of the deer kind with cloven hoofs and with solid horns that are shed every year this class contains the elk the reindeer the stag the buck the roebuck and the axis  the fifth class comprehends all those of the hog kind the pecari and the bayberroussa  the sixth class is that numerous one of the cat kind this comprehends the cat the lion the panther the leopard the jaguar the cougar the jaguarette the lynx the ounce and the catamountain these are all carnivorous and furnished with crooked claws which they can sheath and unsheath at pleasure  the seventh class is that of the dog kind carnivorous and furnished with claws like the former but which they cannot sheath this class comprehends the dog the wolf the fox the jackall the isatis the hyena the civette the gibet and the genet  the eighth class is that of the weasil kind with a long small body with five toes or claws on each foot the first of them separated from the rest like a thumb this comprehends the weasil the martin the polecat the ferrit the mangoust the vansire the ermin with all the varieties of the american moufettes  the ninth class is that of the rabbit kind with two large cutting teeth in each jaw this comprehends the rabbit the hare the guineapig all the various species of the squirrel the dormouse the marrnotte the rat the mouse agouti the paca the aperea and the tapeti  the tenth class is that of the hedgehog kind with claw feet and covered with prickles comprehending the hedgehog and the porcupine the couendou and the urson  the eleventh class is that of the tortoise kind covered with a shell or scales this comprehends the tortoise the pangolin and the phataguin  the twelfth is if the otter or amphibious kind comprehending the otter the beaver the desman the morse and the seal  the thirteenth class is that of the ape and monkey kinds with hands and feet resembling hinds  the fifteenth class is that of winged quadrupedes or the bat kind containing the bat the flying squirrel and some other varieties  the animals which seem to approach no other kind either in nature or in form but to make each a distinct species in itself are the following the elephant the rhinoceros the hippopotamos the camelopard the camel the bear the badger the tapir the cabiai the coati the antbear the tatou and lastly the sloth  all other quadrupedes whose names are not set down will be found among some of the abovementioned classes and referred to that which they most resemble when therefore we are at a loss to know the name of any particular animal by examining which of the known kinds it most resembles either in shape or in hoofs or claws and then examining the particular description we shall be able to discover not only its name but its history i have already said that all methods of this kind are merely arbitrary and that nature makes no exact distinction between her productions it is hard for instance to tell whether we ought to refer the civet to the dog or the cat kind but if we know the exact history of the civet it is no great matter to which kind we shall judge it to bear the greatest resemblance it is enough that a distribution of this kind excites in us some rude outlines of the make or some marked similitudes in the nature of these animals but to know them with any precision no system or even description will serve since the animal itself or a good print of it must be seen and its history be read at length before it can be said to be known to pretend to say that we have an idea of a quadrupede because we can tell the number or the make of its teeth or its paps is as absurd as if we should pretend to distinguish men by the buttons on their clothes indeed it often happens that the quadrupede itself can be but seldom seen that many of the more rare kinds do not come into europe above once an age and some of them have never been able to bear the removal in such a case therefore there is no other substitute but a good print of the animal to give an idea of its figure for no description whatsoever can answer this purpose so well mr lock with his usual good sense has observed that a drawing of the animal taken from the life is one of the best methods of advancing natural history and yet most of our modern systematic writers are content rather with describing descriptions no doubt will go some way toward giving an idea of the figure of an animal but they are certainly much the longest way about and as they are usually managed much the most obscure in a drawing we can at a single glance gather more instruction than by a days painful investigation of methodical systems where we are told the proportions with great exactness and yet remain ignorant of the totality in fact this method of describing all things is a fault that has infected many of our books that treat on the meaner arts for this last age they attempt to teach by words what is only to be learnt by practice and inspection most of our dictionaries and bodies of arts and sciences are guilty of this error suppose for instance it be requisite to mention the manner of making shoes it is plain that all the verbal instructions in the world will never give an adequate idea of this humble art or teach a man to become a shoemaker a day or two in a shoemakers shop will answer the end better than a whole folio of instruction which only serves to oppress the learner with the weight of its pretended importance we have lately seen a laborious work carried on at paris with this only intent of teaching all the trades by description however the design at first blush seems to be ill considered and it is probable that very few advantages will be derived from so laborious an undertaking with regard to the descriptions in natural history these without all question under the direction of good sense are necessary but still they should be kept within proper bounds and where a thing may be much more easily shown than described the exhibition should ever precede the account  chap xiv of quadrupedes in general compared to man upon comparing the various animals of the globe with each other we shall find that quadrupedes demand the rank immediately next ourselves and consequently come first in consideration the similitude between the structure of their bodies and ours those instincts which they enjoy in a superior degree to the rest their constant services or their unceasing hostilities all render them the foremost objects of our curiosity the most interesting parts of animated nature these however although now so completely subdued very probably in the beginning were nearer upon an equality with us and disputed the possession of earth man while yet savage himself was but ill qualified to civilize the forest while yet naked unarmed and without shelter every wild beast was a formidable rival and the destruction of such was the first employment of heroes but when he began to multiply and arts to accumulate he soon cleared the plains of the most noxious of these his rivals a part was taken under his protection and care while the rest found a precarious refuge in the burning defart or the howling wilderness  from being rivals quadrupedes have now become the assistants of man upon them he devolves the most laborious employments and finds in them patient and humble coadjutors ready to obey and content with the smallest retribution it was not however without long and repeated efforts that the independent spirit of these animals was broken for the savage freedom in wild animals is generally found to pass down through several generations before it is totally subdued those cats and dogs that are taken from a state of natural wildness in the forest still transmit their fierceness to their young and however concealed in general it breaks out upon several occasions thus the assiduity and application of man in bringing them up not only alters their disposition but their very forms and the difference between animals in a state of nature and domestic tameness is so considerable that mr boffon has taken this as a principal distinction in classing them  in taking a cursory view of the form of quadrupedes we may easily perceive that of all the ranks of animated nature they bear the nearest resemblance to man this similitude will be found more striking when erecting themselves on their hinder feet they are taught to walk forward in an upright posture we then see that all their extremities in a manner correspond with ours and present us with a rude imitation of our own in some of the ape kind the resemblance is so striking that anatomists are puzzled to find in what part of the human body mans superiority consists and scarce any but the metaphysician can draw the line that ultimately divides them  but if we compare their internal structure with our own the likeness will be found still to increase and we shall perceive many advantages they enjoy in common with us above the lower tribes of nature like us they are placed above the class of birds by bringing forth their young alive like us they are placed above the class of fishes by breathing through the lungs like us they are placed above the class of insects by having red blood circulating through their veins and lastly like us they are different from almost all the other classes of animated nature being either wholly or partly covered with hair thus nearly are we represented in point of conformation to the class of animals immediately below us and this shows what little reason we have to be proud of our persons alone to the perfection of which quadrupedes make such very near approaches  the similitude of quadrupedes to man obtains also in the fixedness of their nature and their being less apt to be changed by the influence of climate or food than the lower ranks of nature buffon vol xviii p      birds are found very apt to alter both in color and size fishes likewise still more insects may be quickly brought to change and adapt themselves to the climate and if we descend to plants which may be allowed to have a kind of living existence their kinds may be surprizingly and readily altered and taught to assume new forms the figure of every animal may be considered as a kind of drapery which it may be made to put on or off by human assiduity in man the drapery is almost invariable in quadrupedes it admits of some variation and the variety may be made greater still as we descend to the inferior classes of animal existence  quadrupedes although they are thus strongly marked and in general divided from the various kinds around them yet still some of them are often of so equivocal a nature that it is hard to tell whether they ought to be ranked in the quadrupede class or degraded to those below them if for instance we were to marshal the whole groupe of animals round man placing the most perfect next him and those most equivocal near the classes they most approach we should find it difficult after the principal had taken their stations near him where to place many that lie at the outskirts of this phalanx the bat makes a near approach to the aerial tribe and might by some be reckoned among the birds the porcupine has not less pretensions to that class being covered with quills and showing that birds are not the only part of nature that are furnished with such a defense the armadilla might be referred to the tribe of insects or snails being like them covered with a shell the seal and the morse might be ranked among the fishes like them being furnished with fins and almost constantly residing in the same element all these the farther they recede from the human figure become less perfect and may be considered as the lowest kinds of that class to which we have referred them  but although the variety in quadrupedes is thus great they all seem well adapted to the stations in which they are placed there is scarce one of them how rudely shaped soever that is not formed to enjoy a state of happiness fitted to its nature all its deformities are only relative to us but all its enjoyments are peculiarly its own we may superficially suppose the sloth that takes up months in climbing a single tree or the mole whose eyes are too small for distinct vision are wretched and helpless creatures but it is probable that their life with respect to themselves is a life of luxury the most pleasing food is easily obtained and as they are abridged in one pleasure it may be doubled in those which remain quadrupedes and all the lower kinds of animals have at worst but the torments of immediate evil to encounter and this is but transient and accidental man has two sources of calamity that which he foresees as well as that which he feels so that if his reward were to be in this life alone then indeed would he be of all beings the most wretched  the heads of quadrupedes though differing from each other are in general adapted to their way of living in some it is sharp the better to fit the animal for turning up the earth in which its food lies in some it is long in order to give a greater room for the olfactory nerves as in dogs who are to hunt and find out their prey by the scent in others it is short and thick as in the lion to increase the strength of the jaw and to fit it the better for combat in quadrupedes that feed upon grass they are enabled to hold down their heads to the ground by a strong tendinous ligament that runs from the head to the middle of the back this serves to raise the head although it has been held to the ground for several hours without any labor or any assistance from the muscles of the neck  the teeth of all animals are entirely fitted to the nature of their food those of such as live upon flesh differ in every respect from such as live upon vegetables in the latter they seem entirely made for gathering and bruising their simple food being edged before and fitted for cutting but broad toward the back of the jaw and fitted for pounding in the carnivorous kinds they are sharp before and fitted rather for holding than dividing in the one the teeth serve as grindstones in the other as weapons of defense in both however the surface of those teeth which serve for grinding are unequal the cavities and risings fitting those of the opposite so as to tally exactly when the jaws are brought together these inequalities better serve for comminuting the food but they become smooth with age and for this reason old animals take a longer time to chew their food than such as are in the vigor of life  their legs are not better fitted than their teeth to their respective wants or enjoyments in some they are made for strength only and to support a vast unwieldy frame without much flexibility or beautiful proportion thus the legs of the elephant the rhinoceros and the seahorse resemble pillars were they made smaller they would be unfit to support the body were they endowed with greater flexibility or swiftness that would be needless as they do not pursue other animals for food and conscious of their own superior strength there are none that they deign to avoid deers hares and other creatures that are to find safety only in flight have their legs made entirely for speed they are slender and nervous were it not for this advantage every carnivorous animal would soon make them a prey and their races would be entirely extinguished but in the present state of nature the means of safety are rather superior to those of offense and the pursuing animal must owe success only to patience perseverance and industry the feet of some that live upon fish alone are made for swimming the toes of these animals are joined together with membranes being webfooted like a goose or a duck by which they swim with great rapidity those animals that lead a life of hostility and live upon others have their feet armed with sharp claws which some can sheath and unsheath at will those on the contrary who lead peaceful lives have generally hoofs which serve some as weapons of defense and which in all are better fitted for traversing extensive tracts of rugged country than the claw foot of their pursuers  the stomach is generally proportioned to the quality of the animals food or the ease with which it is obtained in those that live upon flesh and such nourishing substances it is small and glandular affording such juices as are best adapted to digest its contents their intestines also are short and without fatness on the contrary such animals as feed entirely upon vegetables have the stomach very large and those who chew the cud have no less than four stomachs all which serve as so many laboratories to prepare and turn their coarse food into proper nourishment in africa where the plants happen to afford greater nourishment than in our temperate climates several animals that with us have four stomachs have there but two buffon  however in all animals the size of the intestines are proportioned to the nature of the food where that is furnished in large quantities the stomach dilates to answer the increase in domestic animals that are plentifully supplied it is large in the wild animals that live precariously it is much more contracted and the intestines are much shorter  in this manner all animals are fitted by nature to fill up some peculiar station the greatest animals are made for an inoffensive life to range the plains and the forest without injuring others to live upon the productions of the earth the grass of the field or the tender branches of trees these secure in their own strength neither fly from any other quadrupedes nor yet attack them nature to the greatest strength has added the most gentle and harmless dispositions without this those enormous creatures would be more than a match for all the rest of the creation for what devastation might not ensue were the elephant or the rhinoceros or the buffalo as fierce and as mischievous as the tiger or the rat in order to oppose these larger animals and in some measure to prevent their exuberance there is a species of the carnivorous kind of inferior strength indeed but of greater activity and cunning the lion and the tiger generally watch for the larger kinds of prey attack them at some disadvantage and commonly jump upon them by surprise none of the carnivorous kinds except the dog alone will make a voluntary attack but with the odds on their side they are all cowards by nature and usually catch their prey by a bound from some lurking place seldom attempting to invade them openly for the larger beasts are too powerful for them and the smaller too swift  a lion does not willingly attack an horse and then only when compelled by the keenest hunger the combats between a lion and a horse are frequent enough in italy where they are both enclosed in a kind of amphitheatre fitted for that purpose the lion always approaches wheeling about while the horse presents his hinder parts to the enemy the lion in this manner goes round and round still narrowing his circle till he comes to the proper distance to make his spring just at the time the lion springs the horse lashes with both legs from behind and in general the odds are in his favor it more often happening that the lion is stunned and struck motionless by the blow than that he effects his jump between the horses shoulders if the lion is stunned and left sprawling the horse escapes without attempting to improve his victory but if the lion succeeds he sticks to his prey and tears the horse in pieces in a very short time  but it is not among the larger animals of the forest alone that these hostilities are carried on there is a minuter and a still more treacherous contest between the lower ranks of quadrupedes the panther hunts for the sheep and the goat the catamountain for the hare or the rabbit and the wild cat for the squirrel or the mouse in proportion as each carnivorous animal wants strength it uses all the assistance of patience assiduity and cunning however the arts of these to pursue are not so great as the tricks of their prey to escape so that the power of destruction in one class is inferior to the power of safety in the other were this otherwise the forest would soon be dispeopled of the feebler races of animals and beasts of prey themselves would want at one time that subsistence which they lavishly destroyed at another  few wild animals seek their prey in the daytime they are then generally deterred by their fears of man in the inhabited countries and by the excessive heat of the sun in those extensive forests that lie toward the south and in which they reign the undisputed tyrants as soon as the morning therefore appears the carnivorous animals retire to their dens and the elephant the horse the deer and all the hare kinds those inoffensive tenants of the plain make their appearance but again at nightfall the state of hostility begins the whole forest then echoes to a variety of different howlings nothing sure can be more terrible than an african landscape at the close of evening the deep toned roarings of the lion the shriller yellings of the tiger the jackall pursuing by the scent and barking like a dog the hyaena with a note peculiarly solitary and dreadful but to crown all the hissing of the various kinds of serpents that at that time begin their call and as i am assured make a much louder symphony than the birds in our groves in a morning  beasts of prey seldom devour each other nor can any thing but the greatest degree of hunger induce them to it what they chiefly seek after is the deer or the goat those harmless creatures that seem made to embellish nature these are either pursued or surprised and afford the most agreeable repast to their destroyers the most usual method with even the fiercest animals is to hide and crouch near some path frequented by their prey or some water where cattle come to drink and seize them at once with a bound the lion and the tiger leap twenty feet at a spring and this rather than their swiftness or strength is what they have most to depend upon for a supply there is scarce one of the deer or hare kind that is not very easily capable of escaping them by its swiftness so that whenever any of these fall a prey it must be owing to their own inattention  but there is another class of the carnivorous kind that hunt by the scent and which it is much more difficult to escape it is remarkable that all animals of this kind pursue in a pack and encourage each other by their mutual cries the jackall the syagush the wolf and the dog are of this kind they pursue with patience rather than swiftness their prey flies at first and leaves them for miles behind but they keep on with a constant steady pace and excite each other by a general spirit of industry and emulation till at last they share the common plunder but it too often happens that the larger beasts of prey when they hear a cry of this kind begun pursue the pack and when they have hunted down the animal come in and monopolize the spoil this has given rise to the report of the jackalls being the lions provider when the reality is that the jackall hunts for itself and the lion is an unwelcome intruder upon the fruits of his toil  nevertheless with all the powers which carnivorous animals are possessed of they generally lead a life of famine and fatigue their prey has such a variety of methods for escaping that they sometimes continue without food for a fortnight together but nature has endowed them with a degree of patience equal to the severity of their state so that as their subsistence is precarious their appetites are complying they usually seize their prey with a roar either of seeming delight or perhaps to terrify it from resistance they frequently devour it bones and all in the most ravenous manner and then retire to their dens continuing inactive till the calls of hunger again excite their courage and industry but as all their methods of pursuit are counteracted by the arts of evasion they often continue to range without success supporting a state of famine for several days nay sometimes weeks together of their prey some find protection in holes in which nature has directed them to bury themselves some find safety by swiftness and such as are possessed of neither of these advantages generally herd together and endeavor to repel invasion by united force the very sheep which to us seem so defenseless are by no means so in a state of nature they are furnished with arms of defense and a very great degree of swiftness but they are still further assisted by their spirit of mutual defense the females fall into the center and the males forming a ring round them oppose their horns to the assailants some animals that feed upon fruits which are to be found only at one time of the year fill their holes with several sorts of plants which enable them to lie concealed during the hard frosts of the winter contented with their prison since it affords them plenty and protection these holes are dug with so much art that there seems the design of an architect in the formation there are usually two apertures by one of which the little inhabitant can always escape when the enemy is in possession of the other many creatures are equally careful of avoiding their enemies by placing a sentinel to warn them of the approach of danger these generally perform this duty by turns and they know how to punish such as have neglected their post or have been unmindful of the common safety such are a part of the efforts that the weaker races of quadrupedes exert to avoid their invaders and in general they are attended with success the arts of instinct are most commonly found an overmatch for the invasions of instinct man is the only creature against whom all their little tricks can scarce prevail wherever he has spread his dominion scarce any flight can save or any retreat harbor wherever he comes terror seems to follow and all society ceases among the inferior tenants of the plain their union against him can yield them no protection and their cunning is but weakness in their fellow brutes they have an enemy whom they can oppose with an equality of advantage they can oppose fraud or swiftness to force or numbers to invasion but what can be done against such an enemy as man who finds them out though unseen and though remote destroys them wherever he comes all the contest among the meaner ranks seem to be at an end or is carried on only by surprise such as he has thought proper to protect have calmly submitted to his protection such as he has found it convenient to destroy carry on an unequal war and their numbers are every day decreasing  the wild animal is subject to few alterations and in a state of savage nature continues for ages the same in size shape and color but it is otherwise when subdued and taken under the protection of man its external form and even its internal structure are altered by human assiduity and this is one of the first and greatest causes of the variety that we see among the several quadrupedes of the same species man appears to have changed the very nature of domestic animals by cultivation and care a domestic animal is a slave that seems to have few other desires but such as man is willing to allow it humble patient resigned and attentive it fills up the duties of its station ready for labor and content with subsistence  almost all domestic animals seem to bear the marks of servitude strong upon them all the varieties in their color all the fineness and length of their hair together with the depending length of their ears seem to have arisen from a long continuance of domestic slavery what an immense variety is there to be found in the ordinary race of dogs and horses the principal differences of which has been effected by the industry of man so adapting the food the treatment the labor and the climate that nature seems almost to have forgotten her original design and the tame animal no longer bears any resemblance to its ancestors in the woods around him  in this manner nature is under a kind of constraint in those animals we have taught to live in a state of servitude near us the savage animals preserve the marks of their first formation their colors are generally the same a rough dusky brown or a tawny seem almost their only varieties but it is otherwise in the tame their colors are various and their forms different from each other the nature of the climate indeed operates upon all but more particularly on these that nourishment which is prepared by the hand of man chosen not to their appetites but to suit his own convenience that climate the rigours of which he can soften and that employment to which they are sometimes assigned produce a number of distinctions that are not to be found among the savage animals these at first were accidental but in time became hereditary and a new race of artificial monsters are propagated rather to answer the purposes of human pleasure than their own convenience in short their very appetites may be changed and those that feed only upon grass may be rendered carnivorous i have seen a sheep that would eat flesh and an horse that was fond of oysters  but not their appetites or their figure alone but their very dispositions and their natural sagacity are altered by the vicinity of man in those countries where men have seldom intruded some animals have been found established in a kind of civil state of society remote from the tyranny of man they seem to have a spirit of mutual benevolence and mutual friendship the beavers in these distant solitudes are known to build like architects and rule like citizens the habitations that these have been seen to erect exceed the houses of the human inhabitants of the same country both in neatness and convenience but as soon as man intrudes upon their society they seem impressed with the terrors of their inferior situation their spirit of society ceases the bond is dissolved and every animal looks for safety in solitude and there tries all its little industry to shift only for itself  next to human influence the climate seems to have the strongest effects both upon the nature and the form of quadrupedes as in man we have seen some alterations produced by the variety of his situation so in the lower ranks that are more subject to variation the influence of climate is more readily perceived as these are more nearly attached to the earth and in a manner connected to the soil as they have none of the arts of shielding off the inclemency of the weather or softening the rigours of the sun they are consequently more changed by its variations in general it may be remarked that the colder the country the larger and the warmer is the fur of each animal it being wisely provided by nature that the inhabitant should be adapted to the rigours of its situation thus the fox and wolf which in temperate climates have but short hair have a fine long fur in the frozen regions near the pole on the contrary those dogs which with us have long hair when carried to guinea or angola in a short time cast their thick covering and assume a lighter dress and one more adapted to the warmth of the country the beaver and the ermine which are found in the greatest plenty in the cold regions are remarkable for the warmth and delicacy of their furs while the elephant and the rhinoceros that are natives of the line have scarce any hair at all not but that human industry can in some measure cooperate with or repress the effects of climate in this particular it is well known what alterations are produced by proper care in the sheeps fleece in different parts of our own country and the same industry is pursued with a like success in syria where many of their animals are clothed with a long and beautiful hair which they take care to improve as they work it into that stuff called camblet so well known in different parts of europe  the disposition of the animal seems also not less marked by the climate than the figure the same causes that seem to have rendered the human inhabitants of the rigorous climates savage and ignorant have also operated upon their animals both at the line and the pole the wild quadrupedes are fierce and untameable in these latitudes their savage dispositions having not been quelled by any efforts from man and being still farther stimulated by the severity of the weather they continue fierce and untractable most of the attempts which have hitherto been made to tame the wild beasts brought home from the pole or the equator have proved ineffectual they are gentle and harmless enough while young but as they grow up they acquire their natural ferocity and snap at the hand that feeds them it may indeed in general be asserted that in all countries where the men are most barbarous the beasts are most fierce and cruel and this is but a natural consequence of the struggle between man and the more savage animals of the forest for in proportion as he is weak and timid they must be bold and intrusive in proportion as his dominion is but feebly supported their rapacity must be more obnoxious in the extensive countries therefore lying round the pole or beneath the line the quadrupedes are fierce and formidable africa has ever been remarked for the brutality of its men and the fierceness of its animals its lions and its leopards are not less terrible than its crocodiles and its serpents their dispositions seem entirely marked with the rigours of the climate and being bred in an extreme of heat they show a peculiar ferocity that neither the force of man can conquer nor his arts allay however it is happy for the wretched inhabitants of those climates that its most formidable animals are all solitary ones that they have not learnt the art of uniting to oppress mankind but each depending on its own strength invades without any assistant  the food also is another cause in the variety which we find among quadrupedes of the same kind thus the beasts which feed in the valley are generally larger than those which glean a scanty subsistence on the mountain such as live in the warm climates where the plants are much larger and more succulent than with us are equally remarkable for their bulk the ox fed in the plains of indostan is very much larger than that which is more hardily maintained on the side of the alps the deserts of africa where the plants are extremely nourishing produce the largest and fiercest animals and perhaps for a contrary reason america is found not to produce such large animals as are seen in the ancient continent but whatever be the reason the fact is certain that while america exceeds us in the size of its reptiles of all kinds it is far inferior in its quadrupede productions thus for instance the largest animal of that country is the tapir which can by no means be compared to the elephant of africa its beasts of prey also are divested of that strength and courage which is so dangerous in this part of the world the american lion tiger and leopard if such diminutive creatures deserve these names are neither so fierce nor so valiant as those of africa and asia the tiger of bengal has been seen to measure twelve feet in length without including the tail whereas the american tiger seldom exceeds three this difference obtains still more in the other animals of that country so that some have been of opinion buffon that all quadrupedes in southern america are of a different species from those most resembling them in the old world and that there are none which are common to both but such as have entered america by the north and which being able to bear the rigours of the frozen pole have traveled from the ancient continent by that passage into the new thus the bear the wolf the elk the stag the fox and the beaver are known to the inhabitants as well of north america as of russia while most of the various kinds to the southward in both continents bear no resemblance to each other upon the whole such as peculiarly belong to the new continent are without any marks of the quadrupede perfection they are almost wholly destitute of the power of defense they have neither formidable teeth horns or tail their figure is ungainly and their limbs ill proportioned some among them such as the ant bear and the sloth appear so miserably formed as scarce to have the power of moving and eating they seemingly drag out a miserable and languid existence in the most desert solitude and would quickly have been destroyed in a country where there were inhabitants or powerful beasts to oppose them  but if the quadrupedes of the new continent be less they are found in much greater abundance for it is a rule that obtains through nature that the smallest animals multiply the fastest the goat imported from europe to south america soon begins to degenerate but as it grows less it becomes more prolific and instead of one kid at a time or two at the most it generally produces five and sometimes more what there is in the food or the climate that produces this change we have not been able to learn we might be apt to ascribe it to the heat but that on the african coast where it is still hotter this rule does not obtain for the goat instead of degenerating there seems rather to improve  however the rule is general among all quadrupedes that those which are large and formidable produce but few at a time while such as are mean and contemptible are extremely prolific the lion or tiger have seldom above two cubs at a litter while the cat that is of a similar nature is usually seen to have five or six in this manner the lower tribes become extremely numerous and but for this surprising fecundity from their natural weakness they would quickly be extirpated the breed of mice for instance would have long since been blotted from the earth were the mouse as slow in production as the elephant but it has been wisely provided that such animals as can make but little resistance should at least have a means of repairing the destruction which they must often suffer by their quick reproduction that they should increase even among enemies and multiply under the hand of the destroyer on the other hand it has as wisely been ordered by providence that the larger kinds should produce but slowly otherwise as they require proportional supplies from nature they would quickly consume their own stores and of consequence many of them would soon perish through want so that life would thus be given without the necessary means of subsistence in a word providence has most wisely balanced the strength of the great against the weakness of the little since it was necessary that some should be great and others mean since it was expedient that some should live upon others it has assisted the weakness of one by granting it fruitfulness and diminished the numbers of the other by infecundity  in consequence of this provision the larger creatures which bring forth few at a time seldom begin to generate till they have nearly acquired their full growth on the contrary those which bring many reproduce before they have arrived at half their natural size thus the horse and the bull are nearly at their best before they begin to breed the hog and the rabbit scarce leave the teat before they become parents in turn almost all animals likewise continue the time of their pregnancy in proportion to their size the mare continues eleven months with foal the cow nine the wolf five and the bitch nine weeks in all the intermediate litters are the most fruitful the first and the last generally producing the fewest in number and the worst of the kind  whatever be the natural disposition of animals at other times they all acquire new courage when they consider themselves as defending their young no terrors can then drive them from the post of duty the mildest begin to exert their little force and resist the most formidable enemy where resistance is hopeless they then incur every danger in order to rescue their young by flight and retard their own expedition by providing for their little ones when the female opossum an animal of america is pursued she instantly takes her young into a false belly with which nature has supplied her and carries them off or dies in the endeavor i have been lately assured of a shefox which when hunted took her cub in her mouth and run for several miles without quitting it until at last she was forced to leave it behind upon the approach of a mastiff as she ran through a farmers yard but if at this period the mildest animals acquire new fierceness how formidable must those be that subsist by rapine at such times no obstacles can stop their ravage nor no threats can terrify the lioness then seems more hardy than even the lion himself she attacks men and beasts indiscriminately and carries all she can overcome reeking to her cubs whom she thus early accustoms to slaughter milk in the carnivorous animals is much more sparing than in others and it may be for this reason that all such carry home their prey alive that in feeding their young its blood may supply the deficiencies of nature and serve instead of that milk with which they are so sparingly supplied  nature that has thus given them courage to defend their young has given them instinct to choose the proper times of copulation so as to bring forth when the provision suited to each kind is to be found in the greatest plenty the wolf for instance couples in december so that the time of pregnancy continuing five months it may have its young in april the mare who goes eleven months admits the horse in summer in order to foal about the beginning of may on the contrary those animals which lay up provisions for the winter such as the beaver and the marmotte couple in the latter end of autumn so as to have their young about january against which season they have provided a very comfortable store these seasons for coupling however among some of the domestic kinds are generally in consequence of the quantity of provisions with which they are at any time supplied thus we may by feeding any of these animals and keeping off the rigor of the climate make them breed whenever we please in this manner those contrive who produce lambs all the year round  the choice of situation in bringing forth is also very remarkable in most of the rapacious kinds the female takes the utmost precautions to hide the place of her retreat from the male who otherwise when pressed by hunger would be apt to devour her cubs she seldom therefore strays far from the den and never approaches it while he is in view nor visits him again till her young are capable of providing for themselves such animals as are of tender constitutions take the utmost care to provide a place of warmth as well as safety for their young the rapacious kinds bring forth in the thickest woods those that chew the cud with the various tribes of the vermin kind choose some hiding place in the neighborhood of man some dig holes in the ground some choose the hollow of a tree and all the amphibious kinds bring up their young near the water and accustom them betimes to their proper element  thus nature seems kindly careful for the protection of the meanest of her creatures but there is one class of quadrupedes that seems entirely left to chance that no parent stands forth to protect nor no instructor leads to teach the arts of subsistence these are the quadrupedes that are brought forth from the egg such as the lizard the tortoise and the crocodile the fecundity of all other animals compared with these is sterility itself these bring forth above two hundred at a time but as the offspring is more numerous the parental care is less exerted thus the numerous brood of eggs are without farther solicitude buried in the warm sands of the shore and the heat of the sun alone is left to bring them to perfection to this perfection they arrive almost as soon as disengaged from the shell most of them without any other guide than instinct immediately make to the water in their passage thither they have numberless enemies to fear the birds of prey that haunt the shore the beasts that accidentally come that way and even the animals themselves that give them birth are known with a strange rapacity to thin their numbers as well as the rest  but it is kindly ordered by providence that these animals which are mostly noxious should thus have many destroyers were it not for this by their extreme fecundity they would soon overrun the earth and cumber all our plains with deformity  chap xv of the horse as it may happen that in a description where it is the aim rather to insert what is not usually known than all that is known some of the more obvious particulars may be omitted i will take leave to subjoin in the notes the characteristic marks of each animal as given us by linnaeus the horse with six cutting teeth before and single hoofed a native of europe and the east but i rather believe of africa a generous proud and strong animal fit either for the draught the course or the road he is delighted with woods he takes care of his hinder parts defends himself from the flies with his tail scratches his fellow defends its young calls by neighing sleeps after nightfall fights by kicking and by biting also rolls on the ground when he sweats eats the grass closer than the ox distributes the seed by dunging wants a gall bladder never vomits the foal is produced with the feet stretched out he is injured by being struck on the ear upon the stiffle by being caught by

the ethmoid bones of the nose called the glanders is with us the most infectious and fatal he eats hemlock without injury the mare goes with foal   0 days the placenta is not fixed he acquires the canine teeth not till the age of five years  animals of the horse kind deserve a place next to man in an history of nature their activity their strength their usefulness and their beauty all contribute to render them the principal objects of our curiosity and care a race of creatures in whose welfare we are interested next to our own  of all the quadrupede animals the horse seems the most beautiful the noble largeness of his form the glossy smoothness of his skin the graceful ease of his motions and the exact symmetry of his shape have taught us to regard him as the first and as the most perfectly formed and yet what is extraordinary enough if we examine him internally his structure will be found the most different from that of man of all other quadrupedes whatsoever as the ape approaches us the nearest in internal conformation so the horse is the most remote histoire naturelle daubenton vol vii p      a striking proof that there may be oppositions of beauty and that all grace is not to be referred to one standard  to have an idea of this noble animal in his native simplicity we are not to look for him in the pastures or the stables to which he has been consigned by man but in those wild and extensive plains where he has been originally produced where he ranges without control and riots in all the variety of luxurious nature in this state of happy independence he disdains the assistance of man which only tends to servitude in those boundless tracts whether of africa or new spain where he runs at liberty he seems no way incommoded with the inconveniences to which he is subject in europe the continual verdure of the fields supplies his wants and the climate that never knows a winter suits his constitution which naturally seems adapted to heat his enemies of the forest are but few for none but the greater kinds will venture to attack him any one of these he is singly able to overcome while at the same time he is content to find safety in society for the wild horses of those countries always herd together  in these countries therefore the horses are often seen feeding in droves of five or six hundred as they do not carry on war against any other race of animals they are satisfied to remain entirely upon the defensive the pastures on which they live satisfy all their appetites and all other precautions are purely for their security in case of a surprise as they are never attacked but at a disadvantage whenever they sleep in the forests they have always one among their number that stands as sentinel to give notice of any approaching danger and this office they take by turns dictionaire universelle des animaux p     if a man approaches them while they are feeding by day their sentinel walks up boldly near him as if to examine his strength or to intimidate him from proceeding but as the man approaches within pistol shot the sentinel then thinks it high time to alarm his fellows this he does by a loud kind of snorting upon which they all take the signal and fly off with the speed of the wind their faithful sentinel bringing up the rear labat tome vii   it is not easy to say from what country the horse came originally it should seem that the colder climates do not agree with his constitution for although he is found almost in them all yet his form is altered there and he is found at once diminutive and ill shaped we have the testimony of the ancients that there were wild horses once in europe at present however they are totally brought under subjection and even those which are found in america are of a spanish breed which being sent thither upon its first discovery have since become wild and have spread over all the south of that vast continent almost to the streights of magellan these in general are a small breed of about fourteen hands high they have thick jaws and clumsy joints their ears and neck also are long they are easily tamed for the horse by nature is a gentle complying creature and resists rather from fear than obstinacy they are caught by a kind of nooze and then held fast by the legs and tied to a tree where they are left for two days without food or drink by that time they begin to grow manageable and in some weeks they become as tame as if they had never been in a state of wildness if by any accident they are once more set at liberty they never become wild again but know their masters and come to their call some of the buccaneers have often been agreeably surprised after a long absence to see their faithful horses once more present themselves with their usual assiduity and come up with fond submission to receive the rein  these american horses however cannot properly be ranked among the wild races since they were originally bred from such as were tame it is not in the new but the old world that we are to look for this animal in a true state of nature in the extensive deserts of africa in arabia and those wide spread countries that separate tartary from the more southern nations vast droves of these animals are seen wild among the tartars they are of a small breed extremely swift and very readily evade their pursuers as they go together they will not admit of any strange animals among them though even of their own kind whenever they find a tame horse attempting to associate with them they instantly gather round him and soon oblige him to seek safety by flight there are vast numbers also of wild horses to the north of china but they are of a weak timid breed small of stature and useless in war  at the cape of good hope also there are numbers of horses in a state of nature but small vicious and untameable they are found wild also in several other parts of africa but the wretched inhabitants of that country either want the art to tame them or seem ignorant of their uses it is common with the negroes who are carried over from thence to america when they first see an horse to testify both terror and surprise these poor men seem not to have any knowledge of such a creature and though the horse is probably a native of their own country they have let all the rest of mankind enjoy the benefit of his services without turning them to any advantage at home in some parts of africa therefore where the horse runs wild the natives seem to consider him rather in the light of a dainty for food than a useful creature capable of assisting them either in war or in labor riding seems a refinement that the natives of angola or caffraria have not as yet been able to attain to and whenever they catch an horse it is only with an intent to eat him  but of all countries in the world where the horse runs wild arabia produces the most beautiful breed the most generous swift and persevering they are found though not in great numbers in the deserts of that country and the natives use every stratagem to take them although they are active and beautiful yet they are not so large as those that are bred up tame they are of a brown color their mane and tail very short and the hair black and tufted marm descript de lafrique l   p     their swiftness is incredible the attempt to pursue them in the usual manner of the chase with dogs would be entirely fruitless such is the rapidity of their flight that they are instantly out of view and the dogs themselves give up the vain pursuit the only method therefore of taking them is by traps hidden in the sand which entangling their feet the hunter at length comes up and either kills them or carries them home alive if the horse be young he is considered among the arabians as a very great delicacy and they feast upon him while any part is found remaining but if from his shape or vigor he promises to be serviceable in his more noble capacity they take the usual methods of taming him by fatigue and hunger and he soon becomes an useful domestic animal  the usual manner of trying their swiftness is by hunting the ostrich the horse is the only animal whose speed is comparable to that of this creature which is found in the sandy plains with which those countries abound the instant the ostrich perceives itself aimed at it makes to the mountains while the horseman pursues with all the swiftness possible and endeavors to cut off its retreat the chase then continues along the plain while the ostrich makes use of both legs and wings to assist its motion however an horse of the first speed is able to out run it so that the poor animal is then obliged to have recourse to art to elude the hunter by frequently turning at length finding all escape hopeless it hides its head wherever it can and suffers itself tamely to be taken if the horse in a trial of this kind shows great speed and is not readily tired his price becomes proportionably great and there are some horses valued at a thousand ducats  but the horses thus caught or trained in this manner are at present but very few the value of arabian horses over all the world has in a great measure thinned the deserts of the wild breed and there are very few to be found in those countries except such as are tame the arabians as we are told by historians first began the management of horses in the time of sheque ismael before that they wandered wild along the face of the country neglected and useless but the natives then first began to tame their fierceness and to improve their beauty so that at present they possess a race of the most beautiful horses in the whole world with which they drive a trade and furnish the stables of princes at immense prices  there is scarce an arabian how poor soever but is provided with his horse buffon  they in general make use of mares in their ordinary excursions experience having taught them that they support fatigue thirst and hunger better than the horses are found to do they are also less vicious of a gentler nature and are not so apt to neigh they are more harmless also among themselves not so apt to kick or hurt each other but remain whole days together without the least mischief the turks on the contrary are not fond of mares and the arabians sell them such horses as they do not choose to keep for stallions at home they preserve the pedigree of their horses with great care and for several ages back they know their alliances and all their genealogy they distinguish the races by different names and divide them into three classes the first is that of the nobles the ancient breed and unadulterated on either side the second is that of the horses of the ancient race but adulterated and the third is that of the common and inferior kind the last they sell at a low price but those of the first class and even of the second amongst which are found horses of equal value to the former are sold extremely dear they know by long experience the race of an horse by his appearance they can tell the name the surname the color and the marks properly belonging to each when they are not possessed of stallions of the noble race themselves for their mares they borrow from their neighbors paying a proper price as with us and receive a written attestation of the whole in this attestation is contained the name of the horse and the mare and their respective genealogies when the mare has produced her foal new witnesses are called and a new attestation signed in which are described the marks of the foal and the day noted when it was brought forth these attestations increase the value of the horse and they are given to the person who buys him the most ordinary mare of this race sells for five hundred crowns there are many that sell for a thousand and some of the very finest kinds for fourteen or fifteen hundred pound as the arabians have no other house but a tent to live in this also serves them for a stable so that the mare the foal the husband the wife and the children lie all together indiscriminately the little children are often seen upon the body or the neck of the mare while these continue inoffensive and harmless permitting them thus to play with and caress them without any injury the arabians never beat their horses they treat them gently they speak to them and seem to hold a discourse they use them as friends they never attempt to increase their speed by the whip nor spur them but in cases of necessity however when this happens they set off with amazing swiftness they leap over obstacles with as much agility as a buck and if the rider happens to fall they are so manageable that they stand stock still in the midst of their most rapid career the arabian horses are of a middle size easy in their motions and rather inclined to leanness than fat they are regularly dressed every morning and evening and with such care that the smallest roughness is not left upon their skins they wash the legs the mane and the tail which they never cut and which they seldom comb left they should thin the hair they give them nothing to eat during the day they only give them to drink once or twice and at sunset they hang a bag to their heads in which there is about half a bushel of clean barley they continue eating the whole night and the bag is again taken away the next morning they are turned out to pasture in the beginning of march when the grass is pretty high and at which time the mares are given to the stallion when the spring is past they take them again from pasture and they get neither grass nor hay during the rest of the year barley is their only food except now and then a little straw the mane of the foal is always clipped off when about a year or eighteen months old in order to make it stronger and thicker they begin to break them at two years old or two years and an half at farthest they never saddle or bridle them till at that age and then they are always kept ready saddled at the door of the tent from morning till sunset in order to be prepared against any surprise they at present seem sensible of the great advantage their horses are to the country there is a law therefore that prohibits the exportation of the mares and such stallions as are brought into england are generally purchased on the eastern shores of africa and come round to us by the cape of good hope they are in general less in stature than our own being not above fourteen or fourteen hands and an half high their motions are much more graceful and swifter than of our own horses but nevertheless their speed is far from being equal they run higher from the ground their stroke is not so long and close and they are far inferior in bottom still however they must be considered as the first and finest breed in the world and that from which all others have derived their principal qualifications it is even probable that arabia is the original country of horses since there instead of crossing the breed they take every precaution to keep it entire in other countries they must continually change the races or their horses would soon degenerate but there the same blood has past down through a long succession without any diminution either of force or beauty  the race of arabian horses has spread itself into barbary among the moors and has even extended across that extensive continent to the western shores of africa among the negroes of gambia and senegal the chiefs of the country are possessed of horses which though little are very beautiful and extremely manageable instead of barley they are fed in those countries with maize bruised and reduced into meal and mixed up with milk when they design to fatten them these are considered as next to the arabian horses both for swiftness and beauty but they are rather still smaller than the former the italians have a peculiar sport in which horses of this breed run against each other they have no riders but saddles so formed as to flap against the horses sides as they move and thus to spur them forward they are set to run in a kind of railed walk about a mile long out of which they never attempt to escape but when they once set forward they never stop although the walk from one end to the other is covered with a crowd of spectators which opens and gives way as the horses approach our horses would scarcely in this manner face a crowd and continue their speed without a rider through the midst of a multitude and indeed it is a little surprising how in such a place the horses find their own way however what our english horses may want in sagacity they make up by their swiftness and it has been found upon computation that their speed is nearly one fourth greater even carrying a rider than that of the swiftest barb without one  the arabian breed has been diffused into egypt as well as barbary and into persia also where as we are told by marcus paulus there are studs of ten thousand white mares all together very fleet and with the hoof so hard that shoeing is unnecessary in these countries they in general give their horses the same treatment that they give in arabia except that they litter them upon a bed of their own dung dried in the sun and then reduced to powder when this which is spread under the horse about five inches thick is moistened they dry it again and spread it as before the horses of these countries a good deal resemble each other they are usually of a slender make their legs fine bony and far apart a thin mane a fine crest a beautiful head the ear small and well pointed the shoulder thin the side rounded without any unsightly prominence the croup is a little of the longest and the tail is generally set high the race of horses however is much degenerated in numidia the natives having been discouraged from keeping the breed up by the turks who seize upon all the good horses without paying the owners the smallest gratuity for their care in bringing them up the tingitanians and egyptians have now therefore the fame of rearing the finest horses both for size and beauty the smallest of these last are usually sixteen hands high and all of them shaped as they express it with the elegance of an antelope  next to the barb travelers generally rank the spanish genette these horses like the former are little but extremely swift and beautiful the head is something of the largest the mane thick the ears long but well pointed the eyes filled with fire the shoulder thickish and the breast full and large the croup round and large the legs beautiful and without hair the pastern a little of the longest as in the barb and the hoof rather too high nevertheless they move with great ease and carry themselves extremely well their most usual color is black or a dark bay they seldom or never have white legs or white snip the spaniards who have a groundless aversion to these marks never breed from such as have them they are all branded on the buttock with the owners name and those of the province of andalusia pass for the best these are said to possess courage obedience grace and spirit in a greater degree than even the barb and for this reason they have been preferred as war horses to those of any other country  the italian horses were once more beautiful than they are at present for they have greatly neglected the breed nevertheless there are still found some beautiful horses among them particularly among the neapolitans who chiefly use them for the draught in general they have large heads and thick necks they are also restiff and consequently unmanageable these faults however are recompensed by the largeness of their size by their spirit and the beauty of their motion they are excellent for show and have a particular aptitude to prance  the danish horses are of such an excellent size and so strong a make that they are preferred to all others for the draught there are some of them perfectly well shaped but this is but seldom seen for in general they are found to have a thick neck heavy shoulders long and hollow back and a narrow croup however they all move well and are found excellent both for parade and war they are of all colors and often of whimsical ones some being streaked like the tiger or mottled like the leopard  the german horses are originally from arabian and barbary stocks nevertheless they appear to be small and ill shaped it is said also that they are weak and washy with tender hoofs the hungarian horses on the other hand are excellent for the draught as well as the saddle the hussars who use them in war usually slit their nostrils which is done as it is said to prevent their neighing but perhaps without any real foundation  the dutch breed is good for the draught and is generally used for that purpose over europe the best come from the province of friezland the flanders horses are much inferior to the former they have most commonly large heads flat feet and swollen legs which are an essential blemish in horses of this kind  the french horses are of various kinds but they have few that are good the best horses of that country come from limosin they have a strong resemblance to the barb and like them are excellent for the chase but they are slow in coming to perfection they are to be carefully treated while young and must not be backed till they are eight years old normandy furnishes the next best which though not so good for the chase are yet better for war in general the french horses have the fault of being heavy shouldered which is opposite to the fault of the barb which is too thin in the shoulder and is consequently apt to be shoulderslipt  having mentioned the horses most usually known in europe we pass on to those of more distant countries of whose horses we can only judge by report we mentioned the wild horses of america such as are tame if we may credit the latest reports ulloas voyage vol i p      are admirable great numbers of these are bred up to the chase and are chiefly kept for this purpose particularly at quito the hunters as ulloa informs us are divided into two classes one part on foot the other on horseback the business of the footmen is to rouse the deer and that of the horsemen to hunt it down they all at break of day repair to the place appointed which is generally on the summit of an hill with every man his greyhound the horsemen place themselves on the highest peaks whilst those on foot range the precipices making an hideous noise in order to start the deer thus the company extend themselves three or four leagues or more according to their numbers on starting any game the horse which first perceives it sets off and the rider being unable to guide or stop him pursues the chase sometimes down such a steep slope that a man on foot with the greatest care could hardly keep his legs from thence he flies up a dangerous ascent or along the side of a mountain so that a person not used to this exercise would think it much safer to throw himself out of the saddle than commit his life to the precipitate ardor of his horse the other horses which join in the chase do not wait for the riders to animate them they set forward immediately upon seeing another at full speed and it becomes prudence in the rider to give them their way and at the same time to let them feel the spur to carry him over the precipices these horses are backed and exercised to this method of hunting and their usual pace is trotting  there are said to be very good horses in the islands of the archipelago those of crete were in great reputation among the ancients for their swiftness and force however at present they are but little used even in the country itself because of the unevenness of the ground which is there very rocky and mountainous the original horses of morocco are much smaller than the arabian breed however they are very swift and vigorous in turkey there are to be found horses of almost all races arabians tartars hungarians and those natural to the place the latter are very beautiful and elegant they have a great deal of fire swiftness and management but they are not able to support fatigue they eat little they are easily heated and they have skins so sensible that they can scarcely bear the rubbing of the stirrup the persian horses are in general the most beautiful and most valuable of all the east the pastures in the plains of media persepolis ardebil and derbent are excellent for the purpose of rearing them and there were bred in those places vast numbers by order of the government of persia while that country was under any government pietro della valle prefers the horses of persia to those of italy and informs us that they are in general of a middle size and although some are found even of the smallest stature yet that does not impair their beauty nor their strength yet in some places they are found of a very good size and as large as the english saddlehorses are generally found to be they have all a thin head a fine crest a narrow breast small ears well placed the legs fine the hoof hard and the croup beautiful they are docile spirited nimble hardy courageous and capable of supporting a very great fatigue they run very swiftly without being easily fatigued they are strong and easily nourished being only supplied with barley and chopped straw they are put to grass only for six weeks in the spring they have always the tail at full length and there is no such thing as geldings among the number they are defended from the air as in england by bodycloaths they attend them with the most punctual exactness and they are rid generally in a snafflle without spurs great numbers of these are every year transported into turkey but chiefly into the east indies however after all travelers agree that they are not to be compared to the arabian horses either for courage force or beauty and that the latter are greatly sought even in persia  the horses of india are of a very indifferent kind being weak and washy those which are used by the grandees of the country come from persia and arabia they are fed with a small quantity of hay during the day and at night they have boiled peace mixed with sugar and butter instead of oats or barley this nourishment supports them and gives them strength otherwise they would soon sink and degenerate the heat of the climate being against them those naturally belonging to the country are very small and vicious some are so very little that taverner reports that the young mogul prince at the age of seven or eight rode one of those little horses that was not much larger than a greyhound and it is not long since one of these was brought over into this country as a present to our queen that measures no more than nine hands high and is not much larger than a common mastiff it would seem that climates excessively hot are unfavourable to this animal in this manner the horses of the gold coast and of guinea are extremely little but very manageable it is a common exercise with the grandees of that country who are excellent horsemen to dart out their lances before them upon full gallop and to catch them again before they come to the ground they have a sport also on horseback that requires great dexterity in the rider and a great share of activity in the horse they strike off a ball with a battledore while they are upon a full gallop and pursuing it strike it again before it comes to the ground and this they continue for a mile together striking sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left with amazing speed and agility  the horses of china are as indifferent as those of india they are weak little illshaped and cowardly those of corea are not above three feet high almost all the breed there are made geldings and are so timorous that they can be rendered no way serviceable in war so that it may be said that the tartar horses were properly the conquerors of china these indeed are very serviceable in war and although but of a middle size yet they are surprizingly patient vigorous swift and bold their hoofs are extremely hard though rather too narrow their heads are fine but rather too little the neck is long and stiff the legs of the longest and yet with all these faults they are found to be an excellent breed the tartars live with their horses pretty much in the same manner as the arabians do they begin to back them at the age of seven or eight months placing their children upon them who manage them even at that early age by this means they break them by little and little till at last about the age of six or seven years they are capable of enduring amazing hardships thus they have been known to march two or three days without once stopping to continue five or six without eating any thing except an handful of grass at every eight hours and besides to remain without drinking for four and twenty hours these horses which are so vigorous in their own country lose all their strength when they are brought into china or the indies but they thrive pretty well in persia and turkey the race of little tartars toward the north have also a breed of little horses which they set such a value upon that it is forbidden to sell them to strangers these horses have the very same qualities with those of the larger kind which they probably derive from a similar treatment there are also several very fine horses in circassia and mingrelia there are some greatly esteemed in the ukraine in walachia poland and sweden but we have no particular accounts of their excellencies or defects  if we consult the ancients on the nature and qualities of the horses of different countries we learn that the grecian horses and particularly those of thessaly had the reputation of being excellent for war that those of achaia were the largest that were known that the most beautiful came from egypt which bred great numbers that the horses of ethiopia were not in esteem from the heat of the country that arabia and afric furnished very beautiful horses and very fit for the course that those of italy and particularly of apulia were very good that in sicily capadocia syria armenia media and persia there were excellent horses equally esteemed for their speed and vigor that those of sardinia and corsica though small were spirited and courageous that those of spain resembled the parthian horses in being very well adapted for war that in walachia and transylvania there were horses with bushy tails and manes hanging down to the ground which nevertheless were extremely swift and active that the danish horses were good leapers those of scandinavia though little were well shaped and possessed of great agility that the flanders breed was strong that the gaulish horses were good for carrying burdens that the german breeds were so bad so diminutive and ill shaped that no use could be made of them that the swiss and hungarian horses were good and lastly that those of india were very diminutive and feeble  such are the different accounts we have of the various races of horses in different parts of the world i have hitherto omitted making mention of one particular breed more excellent than any that either the ancients or moderns have produced and that is our own it is not without great assiduity and unceasing application that the english horses are now become superior to those of any other part of the world both for size strength swiftness and beauty it was not without great attention and repeated trials of all the best horses in different parts of the world that we have been thus successful in improving the breed of this animal so that the english horses are now capable of performing what no others ever could attain to by a judicious mixture of the several kinds by the happy difference of our soils and by our superior skill in management we have brought this animal to its highest perfection an english horse therefore is now known to excel the arabian in size and swiftness to be more durable than the barb and more hardy than the persian an ordinary racer is known to go at the rate of a mile in two minutes and we had one instance in the admirable childers of still greater rapidity he has been frequently known to move above eightytwo feet and an half in a second or almost a mile in a minute he has run also round the course of new market which is very little less than four miles in six minutes and forty seconds but what is surprising no other horse has been since found that ever could equal him and those of his breed have been remarkably deficient  however this be no horses can any way equal our own either in point of swiftness or strength and these are the qualifications our horsemen seem chiefly to value for this reason when the french or other foreigners describe our breed they all mention as a fault the awkward and ungainly motion of our horses they allow them to be very good indeed but they will not grant them an easy or an elegant carriage see buffons account of our horses  but these writers do not consider that this seeming want of grace is entirely the result of our manner of breaking them we consult only speed and dispatch in this animals motions the french and other nations are more anxious for parade and spirit for this reason we always throw our horses forward while they put them upon their haunches we give them an easy swift gait of going that covers a great deal of ground they on the contrary throw them back giving them a more shewy appearance indeed but one infinitely less useful the fault of our manner of breaking is that the horse is sometimes apt to fall forward the french managed horse never falls before but more usually on one side and for this reason the rider wears stiff boots to guard his legs against such accidents however it would be a very easy matter to give our horses all that grace which foreigners are so fond of but it would certainly take from their swiftness and durability  but in what degree of contempt soever foreigners might formerly have held our horses they have for some time perceived their error and our english hunters are considered as the noblest and the most useful horses in the world our geldings are therefore sent over to the continent in great numbers and sell at very great prices as for our mares and stallions there is a law prohibiting their exportation and one similar to this obtained even as early as the times of athelstan who prohibited their exportation except where designed as presents  roger de belegme created earl of shrewsbury by william the conqueror british zoology vol i p   to this work i am indebted for several particulars with regard to the native animals of this island  is the first who is recorded to have made attempts toward the mending our native breed he introduced spanish stallions into his estate at powisland in wales from which that part of the country was for many ages after famous for a swift and generous race of horses however at that time strength and swiftness were more regarded than beauty the horses shapes in time of action being entirely hid by a coat of armor which the knights then usually put upon them either by way of ornament or defense  the number of our horses in london alone in the time of king stephen is said to have amounted to twenty thousand however long after in the times of queen elizabeth the whole kingdom could not supply two thousand horses to form our cavalry at present the former numbers seem revived so that in the late war we furnished out above thirteen thousand horsemen and could if hard pushed supply above four times that number how far this great increase of horses among us may be beneficial or otherwise is not the proper business of the present page to discuss but certain it is that where horses increase in too great a degree men must diminish proportionably as that food which goes to supply the one might very easily be converted into nourishment to serve the other but perhaps it may be speculating too remotely to argue for the diminution of their numbers upon this principle since every manufacture we export into other countries takes up room and may have occupied that place which in a state of greater simplicity might have given birth and subsistence to mankind and have added to population  be this as it will as we have been at such expense and trouble to procure an excellent breed of horses it is not now to be expected that we should decline the advantages arising from it just when in our possession it may be therefore the most prudent measure in our legislature to encourage the breed as an useful branch of commerce and a natural defense to the country but how far this end is answered by the breeding up of racers is what most persons versed in this subject are very apt to question they assert that the runninghorse as the breed has been for a long time refined is unfit for any other service than that of the course being too slight either for the road the chase or the combat and his joints so delicately united as to render him subject to the smallest accidents they therefore conclude that less encouragement given to racing would be a means of turning us from breeding rather for swiftness than strength and that we should thus be again famous for our strong hunters which they say are wearing out from among us  how far this may be fact i will not take upon me to determine being but little versed in a subject that does not properly come within the compass of natural history instead therefore of farther expatiating on this well known animals qualifications upon which many volumes might easily be written i will content myself with just mentioning the description of camerarius in which he professes to unite all the perfections which an horse ought to be possessed of it must says he have three parts like those of a woman the breast must be broad the hips round and the mane long it must in three things resemble a lion its countenance must be fierce its courage must be great and its fury irresistible it must have three things belonging to the sheep the nose gentleness and patience it must have three of a deer head leg and skin it must have three of a wolf throat neck and hearing it must have three of a fox ear tail and trot three of a serpent memory sight and flexibility and lastly three of an hare running walking and perseverance  chap xvi of the ass many parts of this account are extracted from daubenton and buffon which i mention here to avoid troubling the reader with a multiplicity of quotations  although this animal is very easily distinguished from the horse at first sight yet upon a closer inspection the similitude between them is very striking they have both a similar outline in the external parts the same conformation within one would be led from the great resemblance there is between them to suppose them of the same species and that the ass was only an horse degenerated however they are perfectly distinct and there is an inseparable line drawn between them for the mule they produce is barren this seems to be the barrier between every species of animals this keeps them asunder and preserves the unities of their form if the mule or the monster bred between two animals whose form nearly approaches is no longer fertile we may then conclude that these animals however resembling are of different kinds  nature has providently stopped the fruitfulness of these illformed productions in order to preserve the form of every animal uncontaminated were it not for this the races would quickly be mixed with each other no one kind would preserve its original perfection every creature would quickly degenerate and the world would be stocked with imperfection and deformity  the horse and the ass therefore though so nearly approaching in form are of two distinct kinds different in their natures and were there but one of each kind both races would then be extinguished their shapes and their habits may indeed be very nearly alike but there is something in every animal beside its conformation or way of life that determines its specific nature thus there is much greater resemblance between the horse and the ass than between the sheep and the goat and yet the latter produce an animal that is by no means barren but which quickly re produces an offspring resembling the sheep while the mule of the former is marked with certain sterility the goat and the sheep may be therefore said to be of one kind although so much unlike in figure while the horse and the ass are perfectly distinct though so closely resembling it has indeed been said by aristotle that their male is sometimes prolific this however has not been confirmed by any other testimony although there has elapsed a period of near two thousand years to collect the evidence  but what tends to put the subject out of dispute is that the two animals are found in a state of nature entirely different the onager or wild ass is seen in still greater abundance than the wild horse and the peculiarities of its kind are more distinctly marked than in those of the tame one had it been an horse degenerated the likeness would be stronger between them the higher we went to the original stock from whence both have been supposed to be sprung the wild animals of both kinds would in such a case resemble each other much more than those of the tame kind upon whom art has for a succession of ages been exercising all its force and producing strange habits and new alterations the contrary however obtains and the wild ass is even more assinine if i may so express it than that bred in a state of domestic servitude and has even a natural aversion to the horse as the reader will shortly learn  the wild ass has by some writers been confounded with the zebra but very improperly for they are of a very different species the wild ass is not streaked like the zebra nor is his shape so beautiful his figure is pretty much the same as that of the common ass except that he is of a brighter color and has a white list running from his head to his tail this animal is found wild in many islands of the archipelago particularly in that of cerigo there are many wild asses in the deserts of lybia and numidia that run with such amazing swiftness that scarce even the coursers of the country can overtake them when they see a man they set up an horrid braying and stop short all together till he approaches near them they then as if by common consent fly off with great speed and it is upon such occasions that they generally fall into the traps which are previously prepared to catch them the natives take them chiefly upon account of their flesh which they esteem as delicious eating and for their skins of which that kind of leather is made which is called shagreen  olearius relates that the monarch of persia invited him on a certain day to be present at an entertainment of a very peculiar nature which was exhibited in a small building near the palace resembling a theater after a collation of fruits and sweetmeats more than thirty of these wild asses were driven into the area among which the monarch discharged several shot and some arrows and in which he was imitated by some of the rest of his attendants the asses finding themselves wounded and no way of escaping instantly began to attack each other biting with great fierceness and braying terribly in this manner they continued their mutual animosity while the arrows were poured in from above until they were all killed upon which they were ordered to be taken and sent to the kings kitchen at ispahan the persians esteem the flesh of this animal so highly that its delicacy is even become a proverb among them what may be the taste of the wild asses flesh we are unable to say but certain it is that the flesh of the tame ass is the worst that can be obtained being dryer more tough and more disagreeable than even horseflesh galen even says that it is very unwholesome yet we should not judge hastily upon the different tastes of different people in the preference they give to certain meats the climate produces very great changes in the tenderness and the favor of several viands that beef for instance which is so juicy and good in england is extremely tough and dry when killed under the line on the contrary that pork which is with us so unpalatable in summer in the warmer latitudes where it is always hotter than here is the finest eating they have and much preferable to any hogs flesh in europe  the ass like the horse was originally imported into america by the spaniards and afterward by other nations that country seems to have been peculiarly favorable to this race of animals and where they have run wild they have multiplied in such numbers that in some places they are become a nuisance ulloa vol i p      in the kingdom of quito the owners of the grounds where they are bred suffer all persons to take away as many as they can on paying a small acknowledgment in proportion to the number of days their sport lasts they catch them in the following manner a number of persons go on horseback and are attended by indians on foot when arrived at the proper places they form a circle in order to drive them into some valley where at full speed they throw the noose and endeavor to halter them those creatures finding themselves enclosed make very furious efforts to escape and if only one forces his way through they all follow with an irresistible impetuosity however when noosed the hunters throw them down and secure them with fetters and thus leave them till the chase is over then in order to bring them away with greater facility they pair them with tame beasts of the same kind but this is not easily performed for they are so remarkably fierce that they often hurt the persons who undertake to manage them they have all the swiftness of horses and neither declivities nor precipices can retard their career when attacked they defend themselves with their heels and mouth with such activity that without flackening their pace they often maim their pursuers but the most remarkable property in these creatures is that after carrying their first load their celerity leaves them their dangerous ferocity is loft and they soon contract the stupid look and dullness peculiar to the assinine species it is also observable that these creatures will not permit an horse to live among them they always feed together and if an horse happens to stray into the place where they graze they all fall upon him and without giving him the liberty of flying they bite and kick him till they leave him dead upon the spot  such is this animal in its natural state swift fierce and formidable but in his state of tameness the ass presents a very different picture the moment his native liberty is repressed he seems entirely to give up all claims to freedom and he assumes a patience and submission even humbler than his situation he is in a state of tameness the most gentle and quiet of all animals he suffers with constancy and perhaps with courage all the ill treatment that cruelty and caprice are pleased to inflict he is temperate with regard to the quantity and the quality of his provision he is contented with the most neglected weeds and makes his humble repast upon what the horse and other animals leave behind if he gives the preference to any vegetable it is to the plantane for which he is often seen to neglect every other herb in the pasture but he is chiefly delicate with respect to his water he drinks only at the clearest brooks and chiefly those to which he has been accustomed he drinks as soberly as he eats and never like the horse dips his nose into the stream as he is seldom saddled he frequently rolls himself upon the grass and lies down for this purpose as often as he has an opportunity without minding what becomes of his burden he never rolls like the horse in the mud he even fears to wet his feet and turns out of his way to avoid the dirty parts of a road  when very young the ass is sprightly and even tolerably handsome but he soon loses these qualifications either by age or bad treatment and he becomes slow stupid and headstrong he seems to show no ardour except for the female having been often known to die after the covering the sheass is not less fond of her young than the male is of her and we are assured that she will cross fire and water to protect or rejoin it this animal is sometimes not less attached to his owner by whom he is too often abused he scents him at a distance and distinguishes him from others in a crowd he knows the ways he has passed and the places where he inhabits  when overloaded the ass shows the injustice of his master by hanging down his head and lowering his ears when he is too hard pressed he opens his mouth and draws back his lips in a very disagreeable manner if his eyes are covered he will not stir a step and if he is laid down in such a manner that one eye is covered with the grass while the other is hidden with a stone or whatever is next at hand he will continue fixed in the same situation and will not so much as attempt to rise to free himself from those slight impediments he walks trots and gallops like an horse but although he sets out very freely at first yet he is soon tired and then no beating will make him mend his pace it is in vain that his unmerciful rider exerts his whip or his cudgel the poor little animal bears it all with patience and without a groan and conscious of his own imbecility does not offer even to move  notwithstanding the stupid heaviness of his air he may be educated with as much ease as any other animal and several have been brought up to perform and exhibited as a show in general however the poor animal is entirely neglected man despises this humble useful creature whose efforts are exerted to please him and whose services are too cheaply purchased the horse is the only favorite and upon him alone all expense and labor are bestowed he is fed attended and stabled while the ass is abandoned to the cruelty of the lowest rustics or even to the sport of children and instead of gaining by the lessons he receives is always a loser he is conducted along by blows he is insulted by unnecessary stripes he is overloaded by the lazy and being generally the property of the poor he shares with them in their wants and their distresses thus this faithful animal which were there no horses would be the first of the quadrupede kind in our esteem is now considered as nothing his properties and qualifications being found in an higher degree elsewhere he is entirely disregarded and from being the second he is degraded into one of the most useless of the domestic quadrupedes  for this reason very little care has been taken to improve the breed it is suffered to degenerate and it is probable that of all other animals this alone is rendered feebler and more diminutive by being in a state of domestic servitude the horse the cow and the sheep are rendered larger by the assiduity of man the ass is suffered to dwindle every generation and particularly in england where it is probable that but for the medicinal qualities of its milk the whole species would have ere now been extinguished nevertheless we have good reasons to believe that were the same care bestowed on the ass that is spent upon the horse were the same industry used in crossing the breed and improving it we should see the ass become from his present mean state a very portly and serviceable animal we should find him rival the horse in some of his perfections and exceed him in others the ass bulk for bulk is stronger than the horse he is more sure footed also and though more slow in his motions he is much less apt to start out of the way  the spaniards of all people in europe seem alone to be acquainted with the value of the ass they take all proper precautions to improve the breed and i have seen a jackass from that country above fifteen hands high this animal however seems originally a native of arabia a warm climate is known to produce the largest and the best their size and spirit decline in proportion as they advance into colder regions  though now so common in all parts of england the ass was entirely lost amongst us during the reign of queen elizabeth holingshed informs us that our land did yield no asses british zoology vol i p     however there are accounts of their being common in england before that time in sweden they are at present a sort of rarity nor does it appear by the last history of norway that they have yet reached that country it is in the hotter climates alone that we are to look for the original of this serviceable creature in guinea they are larger and more beautiful than even the horses of the same country in persia they have two kinds one of which is used for burdens being slow and heavy the other which is kept for the saddle being smooth stately and nimble they are managed as horses only that the rider fits nearer the crupper and they are taught to amble like them they generally cleave their nostrils to give them more room for breathing and many of these are sold for forty or fifty pounds  the ass is a much more healthy animal than the horse and liable to fewer diseases of all animals covered with hair he is the least subject to vermin for he has no lice probably owing to the dryness and the hardness of his skin like the horse he is three or four years in coming to perfection he lives till twenty or twentyfive sleeps much less than the horse and never lies down for that purpose unless very much tired the sheass goes above eleven months with young and never brings forth more than one at a time the mule may be engendered either between an horse or a sheass or between a jackass and a mare the latter breed is every way preferable being larger stronger and better shaped it is not yet well known whether the animal called the gimerro be one of these kinds or as is asserted bred between the ass and the bull while naturalists affirm the impossibility of this mixture the natives of the alpine countries where this animal is bred as strongly insist upon its reality the common mule is very healthy and will live above thirty years being found very serviceable in carrying burdens particularly in mountainous and stony places where horses are not so sure footed the size and strength of our asses is at present greatly improved by the importation of spanish jackasses and it is probable we may come in time to equal the spaniards in breeding them where it is not uncommon to give fifty or sixty guineas for a mule and indeed in some mountainous countries the inhabitants cannot well do without them their manner of going down the precipices of the alps or the andes is very extraordinary and with it we will conclude their history in these passages on one side are steep eminences and on the other frightful abysses and as they generally follow the direction of the mountain the road instead of lying in a level forms at every little distance steep declivities of several hundred yards downward these can only be descended by mules and the animal itself seems sensible of the danger and the caution that is to be used in such descents when they come to the edge of one of these descents they stop of themselves without being checked by the rider and if he inadvertently attempts to spur them on they continue immovable they seem all this time ruminating on the danger that lies before them and preparing themselves for the encounter they not only attentively view the road but tremble and snort at the danger having prepared for the descent they place their forefeet in a posture as if they were stopping themselves they then also put their hinder feet together but a little forward as if they were going to lie down in this attitude having taken as it were a survey of the road they slide down with the swiftness of a meteor in the mean time all the rider has to do is to keep himself fast on the saddle without checking the rein for the least motion is sufficient to disorder the equilibrium of the mule in which case they both unavoidably perish but their address in this rapid descent is truly wonderful for in their swiftest motion when they seem to have lost all government of themselves they follow exactly the different windings of the road as if they had previously settled in their minds the route they were to follow and taken every precaution for their safety in this journey the natives who are placed along the sides of the mountains and hold by the roots of the trees animate the beasts with shouts and encourage him to perseverance some mules after being long used to these journeys acquire a kind of reputation for their safety and skill and their value rises in proportion to their fame ulloa vol i   chap xvii of the zebra there are but three animals of the horse kind the horse which is the most stately and courageous the ass which is the most patient and humble and the zebra which is the most beautiful but at the same time the wildest animal in nature nothing can exceed the delicate regularity of this creatures color or the lustrous smoothness of its skin but on the other hand nothing can be more timid or more untameable  it is chiefly a native of the southern parts of africa and there are whole herds of them often seen feeding in those extensive plains that lie toward the cape of good hope however their watchfulness is such that they will suffer nothing to come near them and their swiftness so great that they readily leave every pursuer far behind the zebra in shape rather resembles the mule than the horse or the ass it is rather less than the former and yet larger than the latter its ears are not so long as those of the ass and yet not so small as in the horse kind like the ass its head is large its back straight its legs finely placed and its tail tufted at the end like the horse its skin is smooth and close and its hind quarters round and fleshy but its greatest beauty lies in the amazing regularity and elegance of its colors in the male they are white and brown in the female white and black these colors are disposed in alternate stripes over the whole body and with such exactness and symmetry that one would think nature had employed the rule and compass to paint them these stripes which like so many ribbands are laid all over its body are narrow parallel and exactly separated from each other it is not here as in other party colored animals where the tints are blended into each other every stripe here is perfectly distinct and preserves its color round the body or the limb without any diminution in this manner are the head the body the thighs the legs and even the tail and the ears beautifully streaked so that at a little distance one would be apt to suppose that the animal was dressed out by art and not thus admirably adorned by nature  in the male zebra the head is striped with fine bands of black and white which in a manner center in the forehead the ears are variegated with a white and dusky brown the neck has broad stripes of the same dark brown running round it leaving narrow white stripes between the body is striped also across the back with broad bands leaving narrower spaces of white between them and ending in points at the sides of the belly which is white except a black line pectinated on each side reaching from between the forelegs along the middle of the belly two thirds of its length there is a line of separation between the trunk of the body and the hinder quarters on each side behind which on the rump is a plat of narrow stripes joined together by a stripe down the middle to the end of the tail the colors are different in the female and in none the stripes seem entirely to agree in form but in all they are equally distinct the hair equally smooth and fine the white shining and unmixed and the black or brown thick and lustrous  such is the beauty of this creature that it seems by nature fitted to satisfy the pride and the pleasure of man and formed to be taken into his service hitherto however it appears to have disdained servitude and neither force nor kindness have been able to wean it from its native independance and ferocity but this wildness might perhaps in time be surmounted and it is probable the horse and the ass when first taken from the forest were equally obstinate fierce and unmanageable mr buffon informs us that the zebra from which he took his description could never be entirely mastered notwithstanding all the efforts which were tried to tame it they continued indeed to mount it but then with such precautions as evidently showed its fierceness for two men were obliged to hold the reins while the third ventured upon its back and even then it attempted to kick whenever it perceived any person approaching that which is now in the queens menagerie at buckingham gate is even more vicious than the former and the keeper who shows it takes care to inform the spectators of its ungovernable nature upon my attempting to approach it seemed quite terrified and was preparing to kick appearing as wild as if just caught although taken extremely young and used with the utmost indulgence yet still it is most probable that this animal by time and assiduity could be brought under subjection as it resembles the horse in form without all doubt it has a similitude of nature and only requires the efforts of an industrious and skilful nation to be added to the number of our domestics it is not now known what were the pains and the dangers which were first undergone to reclaim the breed of horses from savage ferocity these no doubt made an equal opposition but by being opposed by an industrious and enterprizing race of mankind their spirit was at last subdued and their freedom restrained it is otherwise with regard to the zebra it is the native of countries where the human inhabitants are but little raised above the quadrupede the natives of angola or cafraria have no other idea of advantage from horses but as they are good for food neither the fine stature of the arabian courser nor the delicate colorings of the zebra have any allurements to a race of people who only consider the quantity of flesh and not its conformation the delicacy of the zebras shape or the painted elegance of its form are no more regarded by such than by the lion that makes it his prey for this reason therefore the zebra may hitherto have continued wild because it is the native of a country where there have been no successive efforts made to reclaim it all pursuits that have been hitherto instituted against it were rather against its life than its liberty the animal has thus been long taught to consider man as its most mortal enemy and it is not to be wondered that it refuses to yield obedience where it has so seldom experienced mercy there is a kind of knowledge in all animals that i have often considered with amazement which is that they seem perfectly to know their enemies and to avoid them instinct indeed may teach the deer to fly from the lion or the mouse to avoid the cat but what is the principle that teaches the dog to attack the dogbutcher wherever he sees him in china where the killing and dressing dogs is a trade whenever one of these people move out all the dogs of the village or the street are sure to be after him this i should hardly have believed but that i have seen more than one instance of it among ourselves i have seen a poor fellow who made a practice of stealing and killing dogs for their skins pursued hue and cry for three or four streets together by all the bolder breed of dogs while the weaker flew from his presence with affright how these animals could thus find out their enemy and pursue him appears i own unaccountable but such is the fact and it not only obtains in dogs but in several other animals though perhaps to a less degree this very probably may have been in some measure a cause that has hitherto kept the zebra in its state of natural wildness and in which it may continue till kinder treatment shall have reconciled it to its pursuers  it is very likely therefore as a more civilized people are now placed at the cape of good hope which is the chief place where this animal is found that we may have them tamed and rendered serviceable nor is its extraordinary beauty the only motive we have for wishing this animal among the number of our dependents its swiftness is said to surpass that of all others so that the speed of a zebra is become a proverb among the spaniards and portuguese it stands better upon its legs also than an horse and is consequently stronger in proportion thus if by proper care we improved the breed as we have in other instances we should probably in time to come have a race as large as the horse as fleet as strong and much more beautiful  the zebra as was said is chiefly a native of the cape of good hope it is also found in the kingdom of angola and as we are assured by lopez in several provinces also of barbary in those boundless forests it has nothing to restrain its liberty it is too shy to be caught in traps and therefore seldom taken alive it would seem therefore that none of them have ever been brought into europe that were caught sufficiently young so as to be untinctured by their original state of wildness the portuguese indeed pretend that they have been able to tame them and that they have sent four from africa to lisbon which were so far brought under as to draw the kings coach dapper  they add that the person who sent them over had the office of notary conferred upon him for his reward which was to remain to him and his posterity for ever but i do not find this confirmed by any person who says he saw them of those which were sent to brasil not one could be tamed they would permit one man only to approach them they were tied up very short and one of them which had by some means got loose actually killed his groom having bitten him to death pyrard tom ii p      notwithstanding this i believe were the zebra taken up sufficiently young and properly treated it might be rendered as tame as any other animal and merolla who saw many of them asserts that when tamed which he speaks of as being common enough they are not less estimable for their swiftness than their beauty  this animal which is neither to be found in europe asia or america is nevertheless very easily fed that which came over into england some years ago would eat almost any thing such as bread meat and tobacco that which is now among us subsists entirely upon hay as it so nearly resembles the horse and the ass in structure so it probably brings forth annually as they do the noise they make is neither like that of an horse or an ass but more resembling the confused barking of a mastiff dog in the two which i saw there was a circumstance that seems to have escaped naturalists which is that the skin hangs loose below the jaw upon the neck in a kind of dewlap which takes away much from the general beauty but whether this be a natural or accidental blemish i will not take upon me to determine  these animals are often sent as presents to the princes of the east we are told that one of the governors of batavia gave a zebra which had been sent to him from africa to the emperor of japan for which he received as an equivalent for the company a present to the value of sixty thousand crowns navendorf  teller also depiction of the zebra the zebra de seve del isc tailor sculp relates that the great mogul gave two thousand ducats for one of them and it is frequent with the african ambassadors to the court of constantinople to bring some of these animals with them as presents for the grand seignior  end of the second volume
