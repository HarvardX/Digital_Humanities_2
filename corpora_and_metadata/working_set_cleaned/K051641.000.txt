in pall mall and j leake at bath mdcclv  preface by a friend plutarch that justly admired philosopher who has greatly obliged the world by his writings and amongst these by the many curious apophthegms he has given us of the wise and good men of antiquity tells us that socrates meeting one day with menon whom he considered as a man well exercised in all the varieties of conversation as well as a great proficient in speculative wisdom asked him what is virtue and that menon answered there were proper virtues for youth and old age for man and woman for magistrate and private person for master and servant an answer which the writer says excited the admiration and applause of socrates  but what would this wise heathen have said and how much greater would have been his transport had his friend menon by way of answer presented him with writings in which he had entered minutely into the nature of the virtues proper for such different ages sexes and stations had he described these social excellencies so affectingly as to command attention so accurately as to prevent mistake and so invitingly as to engage imitation  but a delineation of moral virtue like this was beyond the powers of human reason and the utmost efforts of ancient philosophy and it is to revelation that greater light to rule the moral world that we owe the more perfect knowledge not only of religion in matters relative to god but of virtue also in matters relative to ourselves and one another no wonder therefore that what menon only mentioned in the general and what even socrates could not have described justly in the particulars should have been executed in these latter times with greater clearness and precision  and yet whatever improvements have been made by christians in the system of moral duty how powerfully soever men are now exhorted to act like reasonable and religious beings how strongly soever those exhortations are enforced by the surer and more animating sanctions of the gospel yet  is it not too visible that immorality and irreligion still obtain in the lives of many and perhaps dreadful thought of the majority and shall not every man who is convinced of the real importance of virtuous principles and practices and of the very frequent apostasy from them stand forth and prevent as far as in him lies this alarming degeneracy from growing more prevalent  many it is acknowledged with pleasure and with gratitude have been the laudable attempts of writers in our own country to obtain this end and these both from the clergy and laity and a valuable accession has been made within the last fourteen years by an author modestly anonymous in his three works called pamela clarissa and sir charles grandison works which amiably illustrate and strongly enforce the proper virtues of man and woman parent and child old age and youth master and servant each of them commuicated in a regular collection of familiar letters written to the moment while the heart is agitated by hopes and fears on events undecided a method which must engage more strongly and prove far more interesting to the reader than a cold unanimating narrative of events long since determined  with such a knowledge of life and manners as is displayed in those works with a capacity to entertain with wit and enliven with humor as well as to correct with delicacy and exhort with dignity we cannot but greatly respect the man who in an age like this has attempted to steal upon the world reformation under the notion of amusement who has found the expedient of engaging the private attention of those who put themselves out of the reach of public exhortation pursuing to their closets those who fly from the pulpit and there under the gay air and captivating semblance of a novel tempting them to the perusal of many a persuasive sermon  in order to render these letters more completely useful in this volume are collected their various important maxims digested under their general heads with references from each maxim to its proper volume and page a work this that has not been more productive of trouble than i presume it will be of entertainment and advantage  sententious maxims and moral aphorisms collecting into a point and concisely but strongly expressing elevated thoughts beautiful sentiments or instructive lessons have always been well received by the public they have been considered as the first strokes of a picture in which are seen the justness and beauty of the painters design though it has not the coloring  the maxims of state for instance drawn up by lord halifax have been greatly esteemed as being the result of long experience and sound policy and the maxims of rochefoucault have met with a reception perhaps too favorable as their tendency seems to be to disgrace human nature and destroy all the virtues and indeed the translator of them says i must confess i have not read any thing in this age that has given me a greater contempt for man  the very reverse of this is the plan on which the following maxims are grounded namely on the real dignity of human nature in order to animate man to act up to his genuine greatness it exhibits man as he really is a compound probationary being fallen indeed from the primitive perfection of his nature yet still great and amiable in the sincerity of his virtues frequently rebelling against the sacred laws of reason and revelation and then always an enemy to his own happiness and the peace of society but sometimes so worthily improving the graces and the gifts of heaven as to secure the blessing of others and the applause of his own mind and advancing within his proper sphere of action the salvation of himself and his fellow creatures by a life exemplary in all the duties of a man and of a christian  such is the great plan such the benevolent scheme of those three collections of familiar letters which have been already translated into several foreign languages and received in our own country with uncommon favor but as the narrative part of those letters was only meant as a vehicle for the instructive no wonder that many readers who are desirous of fixing in their minds those maxims which deserve notice distinct from the story that first introduced them should have often wished and pressed to see them separate from that chain of engaging incidents that will sometimes steal the most fixed attention from its pursuit of serious truth  for the use therefore of all such as are desirous of repeatedly inculcating on their own minds and the minds of others the important maxims which those three works contain and who would refer themselves occasionally to the volumes for the illustration of these maxims this general index both of maxims and of references is now offered to the public in one pocket volume  i shall only remark farther that the histories may be considered as the lives of so many eminent persons and this collection of maxims as the morals and i presume to add with all due deference to the sentiments of others  that these lives and morals will perhaps last as long probably be as much admired and certainly prove much more extensively beneficial as they describe persons exemplary in private and common life than the lives and morals of the heroes of the truly illustrious philosopher mentioned in the beginning of this preface  a collection of the moral

 advice to young women a young woman of whatever degree who keeps men at a modest distance will be sure to be the more valued for it even by those who had formed designs upon her honor i      a truly worthy and modest young woman will value herself more on being descended from honest parents though poor than if she were highborn and her parents unworthy i       the young woman who at the request of her pretended lover keeps secret the indecencies offered to her by him encourages him to repeat them i           the anger of a superior to a young woman who has had the virtue to repulse him is to be considered by her as her glory i        she that is more ashamed of dishonesty than of poverty will not be easily overcome i                 a young woman whose virtue has been once attempted yet throws herself into the same persons company or continues where he is when she can avoid it ought to charge herself with the consequences if she receives new indignities i  0             iii      0   those things disgrace not men in the eye of the world which ruin women i        the man who is capable of rudeness to a woman to whom he professes honorable love ought to be rejected as an husband by a woman of virtue and spirit for his sake as well as for the sake of her own honor i           how much better is it by good fame and integrity to get every ones good word but one than by pleasing that one to incur the censure of everybody else i  0     a man professing honor to a woman has it generally in his power to convince her of his sincerity by more than words i          wicked men will stoop to the most degrading meanness to obtain a favorite end i       0  if a woman knows a man to be a libertine yet will without scruple give him her company he will think half the ceremony between them is over and will probably only want an opportunity to make her repent of her confidence in him iii   0      when a man wishes a young woman of inferior circumstances to confide in his honor he ought to be explicit and not leave it to her to explain in her own perhaps too hopeful way what he means by the word in short the word marriage is as soon spoken as the word honor iii          men frequently take little liberties with women and as those are received are encouraged or discouraged from greater so that it is in a womans power effectually to overawe an audacious presumer and obtain even such a ones good opinion and esteem iii     to         to      a young woman will be in less danger when she rather fears an enemy in the acquaintance she favors of the other sex than hopes a

pretty fellows that she is not always secure in their company by her superior good sense since good generals trusting to their strength and skill have been often defeated by a weak enemy iv          the wife of a selfadmirer must expect a very cold and negligent husband iv          the young woman who will admit into her company any man who shall be of opinion and know it to be hers that it is his province to ask hers to deny will expose her reputation if not her virtue to great risques iv          presuming men are always ready to construe every little civility in their own favor ibid  men have generally more hardness of heart than women whence the latter when they meet not with men of honor engage upon very unequal terms iv          it is so customary with men to make promises and vows and to set light by them when made that a woman ought not to regard any thing they either say or vow that carries not demonstration with it ibid  the difference in the education of men and women must give the former great advantages over the latter even where geniuss are equal ibid  a man who is worthy of the woman he pretends to love needs not generally speaking take indirect means to obtain her in marriage iv          hope in material cases should never be unaccompanied by fear iv      00  when a young woman begins to find in her own heart an inclination to a man pretending love to her then if he be not a man of undoubted honor is her danger doubled as ought to be her vigilance since she has herself to guard against as well as him iv      0   a prudent woman will not trust to her lovers mercy or honor but to her own discretion and the rather as if he mean well he himself will value her the more for it if not well she will detect him the sooner ibid  the doubt which a woman has of her lovers honor is needful not only to preserve her own but his if she wrongs him she can make him amends by instances of greater confidence when she pleases but if yesterday she granted him little favors he will not allow her this day to recede till at last perhaps she puts herself out of her own power into his in order to manifest the insistedon generosity of her affection for him iv   0  0

apprehended by her as meaning too much for her honesty i            she is then to be most apprehensive for her virtue when she finds her heart elated with joy and gratitude for the distinction he pays her i      no riches no favor of the great can compensate for the loss of virtue i      the young woman who sacrifices her virtue to the distinction paid her by her master may well be said to be too grateful i      a handsome female servant should not wish to live in the house of a single man since she will be likely by it to suffer in her reputation in the worlds eye may be more subject to temptation and if he marry will not most probably be continued in her place by his wife i  0    distance regulated by civility and a freedom from pride will make a young woman in service respected by

hunger ibid  nurses by cramming and stuffing the little bowels of infants till they are ready to burst occasion indigestions which turn to bad humors ibid  infants can have no corrupt taste to gratify all in them is pure as out of the hand of nature the food therefore that is given them should be plain all that is not so must vitiate and offend  how bad then is the custom which nurses have to mix wine or spirituous liquors however small in quantity in their liquid food on pretense of breaking the wind generated in their bowels iv          children should not be used to physic that given them by way of precaution as it is called introduces the necessity of physic would a parent beget a disorder where there is none or by frequent use render the salutary force of medicine ineffectual when it

as well as words as we see in such of the young of the brute creation as we are disposed to domesticate and to teach to practice those little tricks of which the docility of their nature makes them capable ibid  there is such a natural connection and progression between the infantile and more adult state of childrens minds that those who would know how to account for their inclinations should not be wholly inattentive to them in the former state ibid  every creature has its natural or instinctive pointings as they may be called teaching it to choose its good and to avoid what is hartful to it in infants the desire they have to be carried abroad into the free air is one of those iv          the wisest ought not to be above attending to the first rules for the management of infants if the child has not good health and are not early rules the foundation of that blessing its animal functions will play but poorly through weak and crazy organs iv   0      at two or three years old or

complied with in such ibid  great vigilance should be exercised over the tempers of children when their notices of things and persons grow strong and significant iv       0  childrens future tempers as to benevolence may be guessed at by their willingness to part with any thing they are fond of iv       0  children should not be allowed to enter too early into discourse with grown people nor to give their opinions on subjects unless called upon to do so  since knowledge is obtained rather by hearing than speaking iv          yet they ought to be encouraged to ask questions for their

and if care be taken by good examples of superiors to make good servants such will not deserve to be treated contemptuously iv          the principles of universal benevolence and kindness especially to inferiors should be early inculcated in the minds of children of birth and condition iv          no part of their superiority will be hereby lost says mr lock but the distinction increased and

were not set above want and that not only for their own sakes but for that of their hearers since independency gives a man respect besides the power of doing good which will inhance that respect and

see tutor  it is impossible he says that in a school education a master can have a great number of boys under his eye any longer than they are in school together iv          hence pamela takes

without the appearance of tyranny that his looks may be of greater force than the chidings of some and his chidings than the stripes of others  and who will rather endeavor to shame than terrify a youth out of his faults  she supposes that this gentleman should allot a particular portion of time for the prosecuting of the more learned studies  and before the youth was tired with them she supposes another portion should be allotted for writing and arithmetic  and then for a relief to his mind that the dancingmaster should take his part  innocent recreations to fill up the rest at his own choice in which diverted by such a rotation of employments all rendered delightful by their successive variety he would hardly wish to pass much time  since the dancing itself will answer both parts that of good breeding and that of exercise  and thus different studies may at once be mastered  moreover the emulation which will be raised where there are several young gentlemen will greatly lessen the trouble of the tutor and advance the learning of the pupils  an emulation which cannot be obtained in a home education where there is but a single youth to be taken care of  such a master not having a great number of servants will be better able to answer for their conduct and behavior  the young gentlemen will have young gentlemen for their companions all under the influence of the same precepts and example  and as little honors and distinctions must needs be very attractive to the minds of youth suppose as a reward for some excellence the excelling youth should be set to read at a little desk raised a step or two to his master and schoolfellows sometimes a little portion from the best translations of the greek or roman histories at other times from the english histories  the master explaining difficult passages and customs as the youth proceeded  might not this in a very engaging manner initiate them into the knowledge of the history of past times and of their own country and lead them in the masters absence to pass some of their vacant hours in the like laudable manner  why may not like triumphs on excelling be as incentive to engage children to conquer difficult tasks as the roman triumphs their civic and mural crowns were to the heroes of old since men as the poet observes are but children of a larger growth iv      0   but if a home education is chosen to which pamela as well as mr lock inclines she thus expatiates upon the qualities of a tutor iv      0   he ought to be a man of free and generous principles yet not tainted with skeptical or heterodox notions  who has traveled and preserved his moral character unimpeached  whose behavior and carriage is easy unaffected genteel  who is not on one hand dogmatical positive or overbearing on the other yielding suppliant fawning  who will study the childs natural bent in order to direct his genius to the attainment which he is most likely to master  in order to preserve the respect due to his own character with every one he must not be a talebearer a whisperer a busybody in the family  must on the contrary have a benevolent turn of mind be ready without officiousness to compose differences  who will avoid the foppishness in dress by which the petitmaitres and french ushers at boardingschools often distinguish themselves since peculiarities of habit and uncharacteristic appearance generally denote a wrong head iv   0  0  and seq  as in a home education it will be very difficult to keep children as mr lock requires from the conversation of servants  it will be a securer as well as more laudable method for parents to insist upon the regular behavior of the whole family than to expect that the child and its tutor shall be the only good ones in it iv       0  nor is this so difficult to be effected as some may imagine if on the hiring of a new servant sobriety of manners and a virtuous conversation be insisted upon as indispensible conditions of their continuing in their service and if the principals take care to support their injunctions by their own example it would be seen that if their service did not find them good it would make them so iv       0  and why should not this be thought a practicable scheme when it is considered that servants when taken are generally at years of discretion and have the strong tie of interest superadded to the duty we require of them to influence them and which they must needs know let them have contracted habits ever so evil are as right for them to discharge as for us to exact from them iv              a

volume to the history of sir charles grandison supposing it ended abruptly and expressing herself desirous to see sir charles in the parental character and to know if the story were intended to be carried further mar        madam i write to your commands sent me yesterday  i have no intention of pursuing further the history of sir charles grandison and hope when you consider the circumstances of the story you will be of opinion that it ends very properly where it does though at the first perusal it may seem to a lady who honors the piece with her approbation to conclude a little abruptly and the rather as the necessary delay in publishing the last volume occasioned by the treatment i met with from dublin made persons imagine that mavelous events and violent catastrophes were preparing and but for which treatment the three last volumes would have been published together  the story of pamela was supposed to have taken place within thirty years that of clarissa within twenty of their respective publications in either of those spaces of time there was room to marry and bury half a generation of people  that of sir charles grandison is supposed to be more recent in his recital of what passed between himself and clementina long before the story began and before he had hopes of being allowed by his father then living to return to england he mentions the rebellion in      and      and that the exultations made over him in italy on the reported success of the young adventurer obliged him to go to vienna  what passed between him and clementina and her family on his return from thence to bologna till he quitted italy and on his fathers death arrived in england may be supposed to take up a considerable space of time  he had been about fifteen months in england when the story begins that takes up a year and half  all this may be supposed to bring it down pretty near to the present time  emily under the direction of so prudent a guardian was not for example sake to be married till she was near twenty  lady grandisons circumstances and her lyingin would not permit her to leave england for a voyage to italy so soon as might be hoped for by clementina and her friends sir charles had a view i fansy to those delicate circumstances when he offered to make them judges of the reasons should he and his harriet be unable to attend them within the next year why they could not  do you think harriet would not be a nurse as well as lady g it would be a desirable thing we may suppose to all their italian friends as well as suitable to the maternal fondness for her to take her child with her but would she do so till it was at least a year old there is no doubt but it would be a very fine and forward child but the heir of sir charles grandison must not be needlessly or for a compliment exposed to dangers and difficulties read again the passage by land over mount cenis acquaint yourself with the bay of biscay were they to go by sea  as to the good jeronymo he is happy where he is lady g makes him alive and merry and have you not an intimation that he is to go to bath and do you think that those salutary springs will not for the honor of our country quite establish him  clementina at the years end may either marry the count of belvedere her malady not returning or as sir charles has engaged all her friends to promise may at her own request be allowed more time you have seen that the count acquiesces entirely with whatever shall be her will in this particular  do you think madam i have not been very complaisant to my readers to leave to them the decision of this important article i am apt to think from what i have already heard from several of them of no small note and great good sense that a considerable time will pass before this point will be agreed upon among them and some of my correspondents rejoice that clementina is not married in the book hoping that she will never marry while others express their satisfaction in the time given her and doubt not but she will some are pleased with the count others not some are of opinion with jeronymo that her compliance with the silent wishes of her friends when left entirely to her own will was the only duty wanting to complete her character she having voluntarily renounced so nobly as she did the only man whom she preferred to him who was the choice of her parents and given up her wishes to be allowed to take the veil  let us take a survey of what is done for the other characters  no more need be said than is of everard grandison or of aunt eleanor  mr deane you see is provided for to his own and every ones content  so is good dr bartlett  the skilful lowther also  sir edw beauchamp and emily are in a way to be happy  who can be more so than mrs shirley why madam would you wish to have further time taken in to conclude a life so valuable so exemplary  sir rowland and mr fowler are not unhappy they are going to caermarthen and you remember sir rowland says there are fine girls in caermarthenshire  mr selby goes on at selbyhouse crowing over his wife and his nieces and though always defeated by their goodhumoured arguments and superior sense crowing on and making all around him pleasant  who can be happier than mr and mrs reeves  lucy has already her peer  i could have given nancy selby to mr orme but that it is not right to put together two persons who neither of them have entire health till they are quite recovered and that would take up time he accompanied by his sister is a second time gone to lisbon you know and she emily hints is not without her lover  miss orme is a good girl and must be happy  as for greville and fenwick who cares for them  the fate of sir hargrave of merceda of bagenhall is absolutely and exemplarily decided  james selby is as good as provided for but if he had not it would not have been much matter  lady betty williams indeed and her forward daughter and miss cantillon are deservedly unhappy and there are too many of such characters in everybodys knowledge to require theirs to be further dwelt upon  lady beauchamp lady mansfield and her family lord and lady w lord and lady l are all happy lord g also and his charlotte is as good as she can be her lord wishes her not better than we leave her  sir charles is the happiest of men plans of his beneficence economy charity have been actually laid down  his lady is as she deserves to be the happiest of women  by what we have seen of both we know how they will behave on every future call or occasion  clementina let me add to the notice i have taken of her is mistress of her own will by the power sir charles in the articles he drew stipulated for her we know she will make herself happy in acts of beneficence and as he has foretold will see everything in a cheerful light that before appeared to her in a cloudy one what will be the result  laurana has been punished in kind as we may say  lady sforza also  the marquis the marchioness the general the bishop in short the whole porretta family are happy to the extent of their wishes  mrs beaumont is highly so in the general felicity  so is father marescotti  should the story which were it prolonged to do everything that seems to be expected would take up more time though not quantity of matter than it has already taken up be continued for the sake of olivia surely no  can it then be more happily concluded than it is  as to what you are pleased to hint of the heros appearing to shine in the parental character have i not in pamela entered into that subject pretty largely and have i not in this history avoided touching upon the same topics that i have treated on in either of the two former  but you will be apt to say you expected more on these subjects from sir charless character than from that of mr b or even of his pamela  but to say nothing of his care for the education of his fathers natural children by mrs oldham see we not from his tenderness to mrs reevess little boy from his goodness to lady ls son and to lady gs little girl from the observation of his lady that the brave are always tender and humane from his general prudence as well as from his own duty to a blameable father whose failings he occasionally deplored with a piety worthy of himself that he would have shone in every part of the parental character who ever knew a dutiful son that made not a good father and where and at what age of his children had i entered into such particulars should i have been allowed to stop since as they grew in years they would have had larger demands on his cares  i might indeed in what is done have introduced a conversation in which the education of children might have been touched upon and his opinion given but the lovers of story would have found fault with me for it as they have done with the few independent conversations that appear in the book however useful others have thought them and besides the occasion must have been forced in nor would the subject have appeared with the requisite advantage handled by or before single men and women or even by young married people who had no opportunities to strengthen their opinions by experience  permit me further to observe that the conclusion of a single story is indeed generally some great and decisive event as a death or a marriage but in scenes of life carried down nearly to the present time and in which a variety of interesting characters is introduced all events cannot be decided unless as in the history of tom thumb the great all the actors are killed in the last scene since persons presumed to be still living must be supposed liable to the various turns of human affairs  all that can be expected therefore in such a work if its ending is proposed to afford the most complete scene of felicity of which human life is capable must be to leave the principal characters happy and the rest with fair prospects of being so  i am however greatly obliged to you madam for having so far interested yourself in the story as to write to me upon it and beg leave to subscribe myself  your obliged and most obedient servant  answer to a letter from a friend who had objected to sir charles grandisons offer to allow his daughters by lady clementina had his marriage with her taken effect to be educated roman catholics mar         i have received my dear friend several anonymous letters written on the same subject with your favor before me of the   th finding fault with sir charles grandison for his offered compromise with the friends of clementina in the article of religion all of them expressing as yours does a laudable zeal for the interests of the protestant cause  one of the gentlemen desired an answer to what he wrote directing whither it was to be sent i do not think myself at liberty to transcribe for you his letter though an anonymous one and which would do credit to any writer but as your letter and his are in substance pretty much the same you will allow me to hope for your attention to the extracts i shall make from my answer to his and if they are not of sufficient weight with you to excuse the hero in this important article i shall be ready at your command to reconsider it  this gentleman wishes as you do that i had gone further into the subject that i had exposed the iniquity of such compromises and shown that the souls of girls ought to be as much regarded as those of boys and the rather as such stipulations are now made a point in course in the marriagetreaties of persons of different religions he is so good as to call for my opinion on the subject thus i answered  give me leave sir to say i have shown in the work when the subject required it that i have the honor to be of your opinion as to this compromise i have in vol iii octavo p  0   0  made the bishop clementinas brother thus say to mr grandison after a debate between them on the two religions you will call to mind chevalier that your church allows of a possibility of salvation out of its pale  ours does not  my lord answers the chevalier our church allows not of its members indulging themselves in capital errors against conviction  mr grandison was a young man he pretended not to be divested of passion it was necessary to let the porretta family and the reader who it was supposed would not be unconcerned in the destiny of clementina see that he was willing to make some sacrifices for those the family made in consideration of so excellent a creature who had suffered so much and was actually in a state of suffering for her love of him what could he do more he asks dr bartlett than to make such an offer he considers it as a very great concession though he must know that it was as you sir observe a too usual one and he tells her warmest relations the general in particular that he would not have come into such a compromise no not in favor of a princess in a beginning address and this he says in answer to the generals question what chevalier must the poor daughters have done that they should have been left to perdition and this put by that haughty man when he knew that mr grandison was of a religion which inspires its professors with more charity than does that which allows not salvation out of its own pale and the souls of whose daughters therefore in his opinion could not be endangered merely by such an education  who that thinks the porretta family bigoted must not have allowed them to think mr grandison so had he not made some such sort of concession as he expected them to make nay the actually made a much greater than be offered the sons of the family and besides were more apprehensive of their daughters change of religion were the marriage to take place than hopeful of his  some concessions are expected to be made in all marriage treaties and contrary to what was proposed in this greater frequently on the mans than on the womans part since it is understood that the wife is more the property of the husband than he is hers and he therefore in marriage makes an acquisition pecuniary sacrifices could not have affected mr grandison nothing but what touched his principles could this was a severe trial to him clementina at the time was the only woman he could have loved he knew not then miss byron but we have reason to believe from different parts of the story that he thought himself not unhappy that a marriage to be entered into on such terms took not effect as well as that it was owing to clementina herself and not to him that it did not frequent as such compromises are in marriagetreaties between people of different persuasions  that these observations lie scattered as i may say in different parts of the story is owing a good deal to the manner of writing to the moment as it may be called as occasions arose in the progress of the story a manner of writing that has its conveniences and inconveniences the latter in such cases as that before us the former in giving opportunities to describe the agitations that fill the heart in the progress of a material and interesting subject the event of which remains undecided  you will be pleased to observe that i had a very nice and difficult task to manage to convince nice and delicate ladies who it might be imagined would sit in judgment upon the conduct of a man in a lovecase who was presumed to be nearly perfect and proposed as a pattern that a lady so excellent as clementina of so high a family and fortune all her relations adoring her so deeply in love with him yet so delicate in her whole behavior to him was not slighted by him what would the ladies and the men of gallantry have said had he not done all it was possible for him to do to obtain so rich a prize  allow me to say that if his distress in different scenes of the story were duly attended to attacked as he was on the side of his generosity his compassion his gratitude his love together with his stedfastness in his own religion i presume that in the whole affair between him and clementina he would be rather thought a confessor for it than a lukewarm man in it be pleased to reperuse what he says to miss byron on this subject in the library at colnebrook vol iii octavo p     0 vol iii p       0 duodecimo  what must be my grief to be obliged to disappoint such expectations as were raised by persons who had so sincere a value for me you cannot madam imagine my distress so little as could be expected to be allowed by them to the principles of a man whom they supposed to be in an error that would inevitably cast him into perdition but when the friendly brother implored my compliance when the excellent mother in effect besought me to have pity on her heart and on her childs head and when the tender the amiable clementina putting herself out of the question urged me for my souls sake to embrace the doctrines of her holy mother the church  what madam  but how i grieve you  he stopped says miss byron  his handkerchief was of use to him as mine was to me  what a distress was here  and what and what sir sobbing was the result could you could you resist  satisfied in my own faith entirely satisfied having insuperable objections to that i was wished to embrace  a lover of my native country too  were not my god and my country to be the sacrifice if i complied but i labored i studied for a compromise i must have been unjust to clementinas merit and to my own character had she not been dear to me and indeed i beheld graces in her then that i had before resolved to shut my eyes against her rank next to princely her fortune high as her rank religion country all so many obstacles that had appeared to me insuperable removed by themselves and no apprehension left of a breach of the laws of hospitality which had till now made me struggle to behold one of the most amiable and nobleminded of women with indifference  then he relates his offer of compromise  and let me add here that noble apostrophe of his when he had been contemplating the perfections of clementina the worthiness of her family and their great offers to him  but o my religion and my country i cannot cannot renounce you what can this world give what can it promise to warrant such a sacrifice  nor are these the strongest instances that he gives of his attachment to his religion and country in the course of the work to say nothing of what might be supposed to pass between him and the bishop in their debate on the two religions in which he convinced the prelate who from that time forbore to attack him on that subject that he had a great deal to say in behalf of his own  in an omission in the sixth volume octavo which is supplied p  0   0  lucy selby is made thus to express herself with regard to this compromise in order to weaken the danger to religion that might be apprehended from the example  how could sir charles so thorough an englishman have been happy with an italian wife his heart indeed is generously open and benevolent to people of all countries he is in the noblest sense a citizen of the world but see we not that his long residence abroad has only the more endeared to him the religion the government the manners of england   how was this nobleminded man proceeds she entangled by delicacies of situation by friendship by compassion that he should ever have been likely to be engaged in a family of roman catholics and lived half of his days out of his beloved country and the other half to have set as to the worlds eye such an example in it  i know adds miss selby he would have made it his study to prevent any mischief to his neighbors from the active zeal of his ladys confessor had a certain compromise taken effect i remember the hint he gave to father marescotti vol iv p     octave  vol v p    duodecimo  but would even that good man have thought himself bound to observe faith with heretics in such a case  and in the concluding note to the work i have further endeavored to obviate the apprehended mischief by declining to contend with such of my readers whose laudable zeal led them to consider this compromise as a fault  thus my dear friend you will see that however usual it may be for people of different religions when they intermarry to enter into compromises of this kind they are not countenanced by the judgment of sir charles grandison who considered as the greatest misfortune that could have befallen him the situation he was in which in a manner compelled him to make some concessions in compassion to an excellent woman who labored under a disorder of mind on his account  after all if this concession of sir charles is to be deemed a blemish it is rather a blemish in his conduct than in his character very few in his circumstances would have done better few so well and what he offered in so peculiar a situation is by no means a precedent to be pleaded in common cases  believe me to be with equal truth and affection sir  your most obedient servant
