consequence to whom can it be so properly addressed you were before ranked in the first class of our theatrical genuises and now you have the additional merit of transforming the grecian daughter into the irish widow that is of sinking to the lowest note from the top of the compass  permit me madam like other coxcombs to boast some favors i have received  you perform the principal character some newspapers have criticisd the farce and the audiences have laughed heartily at it were not i as sensible as the severest critic of them all that it is a triffle not worth the owning i should subscribe

in love himself   nephew yes and with the same lady   bates that is the devil indeed   nephew o mr bates when i thought my happiness complete and wanted only my uncles consent to give me the independance he so often has promised me he came to scarborough for that purpose and wished me joy of my choice but in less than a week his approbation turned into a passion for her he now hates the sight of me and is resolved with the consent of the father to make her his wife directly   bates so he keeps you out of your fortune will not give his consent which his brothers foolish will requires and he would marry himself the same woman because right title conscience nature justice and every law divine and human are against it   nephew thus he tricks me at once both of wife and fortune without the least want of either   bates well said friend whittle but it cannot be it shall not be and it must not be  this is murder and robbery in the strongest sense and he shall not be hanged in chains to be laughed at by the whole town if i can help it   nephew i am distracted the widow is distressed and we both shall run mad   bates a widow too  gad a mercy three score and five   nephew but

  bates the affair of marriage is in this country put upon the easiest footing there is neither love or hate in the matter necessity brings them together they are united at first for their mutual convenience and separated ever after for their particular pleasures  o rare matrimony  where does she lodge   nephew in pall mall near the hotel   bates i will call in my way and assist at the consultation i am for a bold stroke if gentle methods should fail   nephew we have a plan and a spirited one if my sweet widow is able to go through it  pray let us have your friendly assistance  ours is the cause of love and reason   bates get you gone with your love and reason they seldom pull together nowadays  i will give your uncle a dose first and then i will meet you at the widows  what says your uncles privy counselor mr thomas to this   nephew he is greatly our friend and will enter sincerely into our service  he is honest sensible ignorant and particular  a kind of half coxcomb with a thorough good heart  but he is here   bates do you go about your business and leave the rest to me exit nephew  enter thomas mr thomas i am glad to see you upon my word you look charmingly  you wear well mr thomas   thomas which is a wonder considering how the times go mr bates  they will wear and tear me too if i dont take care of my self  my old master has taken the nearest way to wear himself out and all that belong to him   bates why surely this strange story about town is not true that the old gentleman is fallen in love   thomas ten times worse than that   bates the devil   thomas and his horns  going to be married   bates not if i can help it   thomas you never saw such an altered man in your born days  he is grown young again he frisks and prances and runs about as if he had a new pair of legs  he has left off his brown camlet surtout which he wore all summer and now with his hat under his arm he goes open breasted and he dresses and powders and smirks so that you would take him for the mad frenchman in bedlam  something wrong in his upper story  would you think it  he wants me to have a pigtail   bates than he is far gone indeed   thomas as sure as you are there mr bates a pigtail  we have had sad work about it  i made a compromise with him to wear these ruffled shirts which he gave me  but they stand in my way  i am not so listless with them  though i have tied up my hands for him i will not tie up my head that i am resolute   bates this it is to be in love thomas   thomas he may make free with himself he shall not make a fool of me  he has got his head into a bag but i will not have a pigtail tacked to mine  and so i told him    bates what did you tell him   thomas that as i and my father and his father before me had wore their own hair as heaven had sent it i thought myself rather too old to set up for a monkey at my time of life and wear a pigtail  he he he  he took it   bates with a wry face for it was wormwood   thomas yes he was frumpd and called me old blockhead and would not speak to me the rest of the day  but the next day he was at it again  he then put me into a passion  and i could not help telling him that i was an englishman born and had my prerogative as well as he and that as long as i had breath in my body i was for liberty and a strait head of hair   bates well said thomas  he could not answer that   thomas the poorest man in england is a match for the greatest if he will but stick to the laws of the land and the statue books as they are delivered down from us to our fore fathers   bates you are right  we must lay our wits together and drive the widow out of your old masters head and put her into your young masters hands   thomas with all my heart  nothing can be more meritorious  marry at his years what a terrible account would he make of it mr bates  let me see  on the debtor side     and per contra creditor a buxom widow of     he will be a bankrupt in a fortnight  he he he   bates and so he would mr thomas  what have you got in your hand   thomas a pamphlet my old gentleman takes in  he has left off buying histories and religious pieces by numbers as he used to do and since he has got this widow in his head he reads nothing but the amorous repository cupids revels call to marriage hymens delights love lies a bleeding love in the suds and such like tender compositions    bates here he comes with all his folly about him    thomas yes and the first fool from vanityfair  heaven help us  love turns man and woman topsyturvy exit thomas   whittle without where is he where is my good friend  enter whittle ha here he is  give me your hand   bates i am glad to see you in such spirits my old gentleman   whittle not so old neither  no man ought to be called old friend bates if he is

philosophy now i may wear it out in twenty years  i have been always banterd as of too grave a cast  you know when i studied at lincolns end they used to call me young wisdom   bates and if they

common sense is come to you my friend  high spirits quick honor a long sword and a bag  you want nothing but to be terribly in love and sally forth knight of the woeful countenance ha ha ha   whittle

heart to act contrary to its feelings would not you hate me for being a hypocrite though it is done for your sake   nephew could i think myself incapable of such ingratitude    widow dont make fine speeches you men are strange creatures you turn our heads to your purposes and then despise us for the folly you teach us it is hard to assume a character contrary to my disposition i cannot get rid of my unfashionable prejudices till i have been married in england some time and lived among my betters   nephew thou charming adorable woman what shall we do then i never wished for a fortune till this moment   widow could we live upon affection i would give your fortune to your uncle and thank him for taking it and then    nephew what then my sweet widow   widow i would desire you to run away

sacrificed twice to those who have them   nephew heaven forbid these exquisite sentiments endear you more to me and distract me with the dread of losing you   bates young folks let an old man who is

bringing me before the old gontleman if he loves music i will trate his ears with a little of the brogue and some dancing too into the bargain if he loves capering  o bless me my heart fails me and i

jontleman by getting one one runs out one way and the other runs in another which makes them both meet at last and keeps up the balance of europe   whittle i am much obliged to you sir patrick i am an old gentleman you say true and i was thinking    sir patrick and i was thinking if you were ever so old my daughter cannot make you young again she has as fine rich tick blood in her veins as any in

enough with my first wife who had the devil of a spirit and the very moddel of her daughter yet a brave man never shrinks from danger and i may have better luck another time   whittle yes but i am no brave man sir patrick and i begin to shrink already   sir patrick i have bred her up in great subjiction she is as tame as a young colt and as tinder as a sucking chicken you will find her a true jontlewoman and so knowing that you can tache her nothing she brings every thing but money and you have enough of that if you have nothing else and that is what i call the balance of things   whittle

considering your daughters great deserts and as i own i have great demerits    sir patrick to be sure you have but you cannot help that and if my daughter was to mention any thing of a fleering at your age or your stinginess by the balance of power but i would make her repate it a hundred times to your face to make her ashamed of it but mum old gentleman the devil a word of your infirmities
