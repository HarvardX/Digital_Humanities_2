saw me watching about this house   don p oh i must not   per not for the world if it should come to don pedros knowledge laud a mercy what a work would there be   don p oh ho i guess how the matter is what you are standing sentinel to watch their motions within   per why how the devil should you know that   don p ah you see i am in all your secrets  i know too that you want to get an answer to the letter that you delivered two days ago to juletta for her mistress   per no there you are out  twas yesterday morning i delivered the letter and she herself brought my master an answer not an hour ago

marcella juletta discovered air i a choir of bright beauties in spring did appear to choose a maylady to govern the year all the nymphs were in red and the shepherds in green the garland was given and phillis was queen but phillis refused it and sighing did say i will not wear the wreath for my shepherds away ii so i confined here with no view of relief no companion but hope which still mocks at my grief each step meeting anguish suspicion and care and driven alas to the brink of despair and worse than all these from lysander away ah tell me juletta how can i look gay  jul ah madam hang melancholy an ounce of contrivance is worth a cartload of it for the first may keep us moaping here till we break our hearts and the latter will point out to us a way to break our prison   mar would it were once effected for i have a thousand terrible apprehensions you may depend on it my guardian will not let me out of his sight if he can help it and at last when we have formed a scheme if it should miscarry we should be all undone   jul so we should indeed maam and if the house was to tumble ten to one but some of us would be hurt lord maam have a little more spirit  is not it your duty

very much obliged to you maam if you would do me the favor to get down stairs   jul what is the matter i wonder  exit don p well i have sent away the lawyers but methinks since the deeds were executed you dont show so much willingness as you did before   mar it is because you are so unwilling to confide in me i am not allowed to take any manner of liberty and at the very time i yield myself entirely to you such is your suspicious temper that i am obliged to keep a guard upon all my words and actions   don p my dear marcella it is because my love is so very delicate i take offense at even a smile or a glance that any person forces from you and the care you see me take is for nothing else but to debar all access of galants and secure to myself the possession of a heart the least thing relative to which i cannot bear to think any body should rob me of   mar in good truth you take a very wrong method and the possession of a heart is very ill secured when people think to keep it up by force for my part was i gallant to a lady in the power of another i should bend all my study to make him jealous for the way to forward such affairs is to take every advantage of the uneasiness and resentments which constraint and servitude create in the mind of a woman   don p very fine so according to this if any should make love to you he would find you disposed to receive his addresses   mar there is no knowing what a woman may be driven to in such a situation   don p but i tell you it all proceeds from my love for you   mar if that be your way of loving i desire you to hate me  air i what state of life can be so blessed as love that warms a lovers breast two souls in one the same desire to grant the bliss and to require but if in heaven a hell we find it is all from thee oh jealousy thou tyrant of the mind ii false in thy glass all objects are some set too near and some too far thou art the fire of endless night the fire that burns and gives no light all torments every
