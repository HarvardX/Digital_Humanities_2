plain directions etc  for the cure of the venereal disease  price eighteenpence  plain directions etc  for the cure of the venereal disease  together with efficacious and approved remedies adapted to every symptom of that disorder  sufficient to enable persons to cure themselves even in the worst and most obstinate cases without the assistance of a surgeon  designed chiefly to rescue the poor and people of small fortunes from the destructive hands of unskillful apothecaries and quackdoctors  by j wall surgeon  london printed and sold by w griffin in fetterlane g kearsly opposite st martins church in ludgate street and e etherington at york mdcclxiv  to the reader the following sheets are the result of a long experience acquired from a frequent attendance upon the sick through every branch and stage of the venereal disease  the medicines directed though in general simple and easily prepared are of undoubted efficacy the whole modern practice of curing the venereal disease being given without reserve in the course of this work and though the medicines here prescribed are to be got at almost every chymists shop yet it is not to be supposed that persons of opulence will give themselves the trouble of mixing the several ingredients i therefore hope my brethren of the faculty will not think themselves injured since motives of humanity solely prompted me to this undertaking which i doubt not will be found to answer the most sanguine expectations of the afflicted  if this pamphlet should answer the authors intentions and prove a means of delivering the vast numbers of poor unhappy creatures that are groaning under the vile nostrums of quack doctors from sure destruction i flatter myself the public will not think my time ill employed at any rate i hope the afflicted will not condemn the practice here laid down but suspend their judgments till they have given the medicines a fair trial  j wall  plain directions etc for the cure of the venereal disease chap i of the marks characters and symptoms which distinguish that branch of the venereal disease called a virulent gonorrhaea or clap as this species of the venereal disease is very frequently met with in practice i shall take all possible care to lay before the reader every circumstance necessary to give him a just idea of the disease since upon the right management of this branch may perhaps depend his future peace happiness and welfare  a virulent gonorrhaea or clap is a discharge of corrupted matter either from the glands of the urethra in men or the vagina in women occasioned from their having to do with an infected person the quantity is always in proportion to the degree of the irritation the quality to the degree of malignity in the infectious matter received from the infected person in coition  after a man has had to do with an infected person he some time after perceives an itching in his yard near the nut and a kind of rotation of the testicles a day or two after the parts begin to shoot and burn most sensibly felt when he makes water which is attended with a scalding heat soon after a running ensues which is commonly of a cream color this is the first stage of a virulent gonorrhaea and nothing can be easier of cure than a clap thus circumstanced but when the foregoing symptoms are either suffered to continue or the infection is extremely virulent these additional symptoms ensue small ulcers called shancres and pockywarts discover themselves upon the nut or foreskin the foreskin is so swelled that it cannot be forced back over the nut which is called a phymosis the running is discharged in larger quantities and tinges the linen of a yellow or green color the pain in making water becomes more violent and a pain is felt in the yard at every erection as if it were violently squeezed with the hand which symptom happens chiefly when the person grows warm in bed and is called a chordee but when the running is restrained or blocked up either from the virulence of the infection the patients catching cold or the improper use of astringent medicines either internally or by way of injection the testicles become swelled hard and extremely painful and sometimes an abscess is formed in the urinary passage which becoming fistulous discharges a very virulent sanies and is called by surgeons a fistula in perinoeo  chap ii some considerations concerning the management of the diet and exercise in the cure of a virulent gonorrhaea or clap i shall distinguish the aliments most proper in the cure of a virulent clap into three kinds first those that are most proper to temperate the venereal virus to abate the inflammation of the parts and ease the scalding heat of urine for this purpose i advise the patient for the first week or ten days to have for breakfast thin milkpottage a mess of sego or two or three dishes of tea with a slice or two of bread and butter for dinner a breadpudding chicken veal or muttonbroth and of vegetables turnips potatoes and parsnips and by all means to avoid flesh meats for the first week at least new milk from the cow affords excellent nourishment and is both cleansing and cooling to the body and therefore a mess in the evening will be a very proper supper for constant drink i advise weak wine and water or small beer  after the virulence is destroyed and the matter begins to be of a better color and consistence i then advise a more substantial diet viz chickens veal lamb rabbits ricepuddings ricemilk chocolate hartshornjellies etc which cool the body thicken the juices and lessen the secretions and consequently the discharge of the venereal running  when the running is greatly lessened and become quite ropy and the pain entirely abated i add to the foregoing diet sea biscuits or jews cakes jarrraisins milletpuddings and hartshornjellies which strengthen much for a diet of this kind gives great assistance to the administration of strengthening medicines where they are judged proper to stop the running as is sometimes the case in stubborn gleets but if as is frequently the case the patients situation in life will not allow him to adhere punctually to these rules yet as he values his future health and welfare let him avoid all salt meats as pickled pork hams salt beef and the like for salts of all kinds heighten the inflammation increase the virulency and greatly lengthen the cure of the running till the disease either changes into a pox or is attended with an incurable gleet and for the same reasons he must avoid too great an indulgence of all relishing acids rich sauces and spirituous liquors as things of the most pernicious nature to those that labor under a virulent clap  exercise in a clap while the disease is recent must frequently be attended with very bad consequences for by violent motion the body is heated and the blood inflamed whereby both the pain scalding of the urine and virulence of the running are increased therefore i would advise the patient during the first fortnight or three weeks of his cure to avoid riding much walking jumping and the like which exasperate the symptoms very much and to keep himself as still as possible for by this means the parts will recover their former tone strength and vigor in a much shorter time  toward the close of the disease when only a weakness of the parts and a gleety weeping remains i advise the moderate use of the coldbath which is a remedy i prefer to all others for it braces up the nerves consolidates the broken fibers of the urethra and strengthens and restores the tone of the genitals  those who are desirous of experiencing the benefit of cold bathing ought in the morning fasting to plunge over head and to continue no longer under water than they can bear to hold their breath for it is the first shock that gives the most vigorous contraction to all the muscular and nervous fibers whereby their due springiness and action are restored but before the patient makes trial of the efficacy of this remedy he ought to be perfectly satisfied that the virulency of the clap is totally destroyed otherwise by unseasonable bracing up the fibers he will only tie up the pocky venom upon the habit which in time will get into the blood taint the juices and produce a confirmed pox  but above all the patient must be careful to moderate his passions wanton pictures lascivious books and amorous dalliances with women must be shunned for the same ill effects will certainly follow these as all other debauches since they heat the body raise the pulse and occasion a larger discharge by the part affected  chap iii to establish the cure of a virulent clap upon the clearest principles of practice i propose to reduce the several curative indications under the three following heads first i shall lay down the most proper methods to assuage the venereal symptoms by medicines that correct and purge off the infectious venom secondly i shall attempt to restrain the running by those means that i have always known to answer the purpose even in the most obstinate cases and lastly i shall lay down the choicest rules to relieve the weakness of the constitution and restore the affected parts to their former tone and vigor to accomplish the first general indication as an intense heat pain and inflammation of the yard are always present symptoms of a fresh contracted clap nothing is preferable to the following method to correct the venom and relieve the inflammation and other symptoms the cure must be begun with bleeding plentifully in the arm which may be repeated according to the strength of the patient and the violence of the inflammation after bleeding the patient must take the following apozem every morning for five or six days  take epsom water two pints and an half scrape a little nutmeg into it and boil it over a gentle fire till it comes to a quart then dissolve in it an ounce of manna and half an ounce of glauberssalt and strain it off for use half a pint of this is to be taken milkwarm every half hour till the whole quantity is taken during the use of the above medicine the patient must drink plentifully between whiles of barleywater milk and water capillaire or any other cooling liquor it is impossible to conceive how this innocent remedy cools the passages and relieves the heat and smart of urine  after having made use of the foregoing apozem for four or five days i would recommend the patient to take two of the following mercurial pills every night and morning or according to the operation one only every night and morning for a week or ten days unless the patient complains of his gums or a sore mouth in which case these pills must be left off for a few days and the quantity of a nutmeg of the purging electuary which i shall give the receipt of must be taken in their room till the sore mouth is entirely removed when the patient may again take two of the pills every night only and the next morning a dose of the electuary which method he must persist in till the quantity of the running grows less and feels more thick and ropy when he must leave off the pills and continue the use of the electuary only every night and morning for a few days longer  receipt for making the mercurial pills take two drachms of quicksilver and rub it with a sufficient quantity of turpentine till it is entirely killed then add a dram of powder of gum guaicum and half a dram of the colocynth pill with aloes mix them well together and divide the mass into twentyfour pills two of which are to be taken every night and morning  receipt for the purging electuary take of the best honey an ounce and an half balsam of copaiva three quarters of an ounce powder of jalap and salt prunella of each a dram mix them together into an electuary the dose of which is the quantity of a nutmeg every night and morning if this electuary purges too much the powder of jalap must be left out and a dram of powder of rhubarb is to be substituted in its stead  when by the use of the medicines already prescribed the pain in making water and the chordee are entirely removed and the running from a greenish or yellowish color has changed to a thick white matter and is very ropy and but in small quantity the cure must be completed by taking twenty drops of balsam copaiva in a tea spoonful of powdered sugar three times in a day or by taking two or three of the following strengthening pills every night and morning  receipt for making the strengthening pills take boiled turpentine half an ounce powder of rhubarb three drachms balm of gilead twenty drops beat them together and divide the mass into middle sized pills two or three of which are to be taken every night and morning  notwithstanding we have observed that the changing of the color of the running from yellow to white was a certain mark of the virulence being entirely destroyed yet the reader is desired to take notice that in persons advanced in years and those who have had several claps this change of color can seldom be effected so that the running continues of a pale yellow or light green to the last though you should continue the use of the purging medicines ever so long you will never be able to change the color of the running but may very much impair the constitution by pursuing this method in this case therefore provided the running is of a good consistence the inflammation smart of urine and chordee entirely gone off and the yard so entirely free from all pain that you can squeeze it somewhat roughly without more soreness than what is usual from a rude handling of this member naturally you may safely proceed to suppress the gleet by the use of the balsam copaiva and the strengthening pills though the color of the running does not appear altogether so favorable as might be wished  if the means hitherto prescribed should prove insufficient and though the virulency is perfectly cured a running should still remain even after having persisted in the use of the strengthening pills for some time the disorder is then called a gleet and must be treated as will be shown hereafter  of the cure of the chordee if the chordee does not readily give way to the use of the mercurial pills and purging electuary the relief will be most speedily effected by pursuing the following method  bleed in the arm to the amount of eight or ten ounces take elder flowers one handful and an half chamomileflowers and mallowleaves each one handful boil them over a gentle fire in three pints of water to a pint and an half which strain off for use foment the parts with this of a moderate warmth frequently till the part grows supple after which apply to the whole body of the yard a little warm and carefully kept on with a proper bandage the following pultice take linseedflower and beanflower each half an handful ointment of marshmallows half an ounce make them into a pultice with a little of the fomentation liquor  but if the patient cannot conveniently make use of the above fomentation and pultice a dram of weak mercurial ointment must be well rubbed in on the whole under part of the yard every other night  cure of the phymosis and paraphymosis the same fomentation and pultice must be used as were directed for the cure of the chordee only a small quantity of spirits of wine and camphor should be added to the fomentation however if this method fails of success from the great virulence of the venereal venom and the swelling increases with very violent pain it will be absolutely necessary to snip the foreskin and give the nut of the yard more room to play  cure of the hernia humouralis or swelling of the testicles the cure of this disorder must be begun with bleeding to the amount of ten or twelve ounces then let a bag truss which may be had of mr white trussmaker in fleet street be got for the support of the swelled cods and let the following pultice be applied every night and morning  take the crumb of stale rolls and boil them with a sufficient quantity of new milk to the consistence of a pultice to which add half an ounce of ointment of elderflowers  when the pain is removed the swelling very much abated and there remains only a little hardness of the part the pultice may be left off and a mercurial plaster spread on leather is to be applied to the part and kept on with the bagtruss which should be worn for some time after the disorder is removed to prevent a relapse  cure of venereal chancres chancres are little superficial eating ulcers occasioned by the venereal venom on the nut of the yard foreskin or some other part near the private parts  dress the sores with the following ointment spread on lint every night and morning first bathing them with a little warm milk  take a quarter of an ounce of hogslard and mix therewith half a dram of red praecipitate in fine powder  the medicines proper to be taken inwardly are  the mercurial pill take ten grains of calomel and mix it with a little conserve of hips into a pill for one dose which must be taken for three nights together and then is to be worked off with the following purging pills  take one scruple of pill e duobus and divide it into three pills to be taken in the morning early and repeated every third morning  these medicines must be continued till the chancres are quite healed and indeed to prevent a relapse it would be prudent to continue taking them a week or two longer after each of the mercurial pills a large draught of sassafras tea made very strong should be taken warm and the same should be repeated every morning except on those days on which the purging pills are taken  cure of the pocky warts and excrescences these though not dangerous are very troublesome companions and chiefly appear on the nut foreskin or body of the yard to remove them nothing is preferable to the following method first bathe them with warm milk and water then rub them gently with a piece of blue vitriol commonly known by the name of bluestone and apply a piece of dry lint to the warts at every dressing this should be repeated till the warts are entirely wasted away the same medicines which are directed under the article of chancres must likewise be taken internally  cure of the bubo or venereal swelling in the groin the first sign of a venereal bubo is a dull heavy pain in the groin arising from an obstruction of the smallest vessels which causes little knots and kernels at first but the pain continuing to increase the swelling grows as large as a pidgeons egg sometimes much larger and the part is sometimes inflamed and the skin changes to a red color  there are two methods recommended for the cure of this symptom of the venereal disease the one by dispersing the bubo before it comes to suppurate by the use of mercurials and purges which as it requires no manual operation is shorter more free from pain and equally safe therefore has justly the preference  the method is as follows first let eight or ten ounces of blood be taken from the arm then apply a mercurial plaster spread thick on leather the size of the swelling this need not be changed oftener than once in four days take inwardly the mercurial pill directed under the article of chancres every night going to rest and continue the use of it till the mouth grows hot and the gums begin to swell and a spitting seems to be coming on but as soon as this happens the mercurial pill must be immediately left off and the purging pills directed under the article of chancres must be taken every morning or every other morning according to the strength of the patient till the soreness of the mouth and spitting are entirely gone off after which you must take the mercurial pill in the manner already directed till the mouth again grows sore when the spitting must be restrained by the purgingpills as before this course must be pursued till the swelling disappears to prevent a relapse a quart of strong sassafrastea should be taken every day for a fortnight or three weeks the diet should be very low and sparing and the sick person should be very warmly clothed and great care taken to prevent catching cold the other method of cure by promoting a suppuration i shall omit giving any account of in this treatise as in that case it is absolutely necessary to have the assistance and advice of a skilful surgeon  chap iv cure of the false clap or virulent discharge of matter from the nut of the yard this discharge is not so great as in the common venereal clap but the nut of the yard is commonly inflamed and very painful and if neglected or improperly treated chancres a phymosis paraphymosis or crystallines are frequently the consequence  to begin the cure bleeding must be performed in the arm to the amount of eight or ten ounces to abate the inflammation the foreskin should be gently drawn back and the part washed with warm milk and water two or three times in a day and the nut of the yard should at each dressing be covered with a small bit of fine lint to suck up the virulent discharge and if the pain and swelling be very violent a pultice of white bread and milk may be applied to the part every night the mercurial pills must be taken as directed under the article of the virulent conorrhaea by continuing this method a fortnight or three weeks the running generally ceases of its own accord but if after using this method for some time longer any discharge should remain it will be necessary to dab the parts with a little red wine in which a red hot poker has been several times extinguished in order to restore them to their natural tone  but if from neglect or improper treatment the inflammation should degenerate into chancres and these should bring on a phymosis paraphymosis etc recourse must then be had to the remedies directed under those respective articles  chap v cure of caruncles and carnosities in the urinary passage which hinder the free passage of the urine and sometimes occasion an entire suppression of urine these can only be cured by the use of the specific bougies which are sold by w griffin printer in fetterlane with printed directions for their use price  0s  d the dozen or  s  d the half dozen  chap vi cure of gleets a gleetis generally the consequence of a venereal clap illcured and is very obstinate and troublesome to cure balsamic medicines are very seldom of any service in this disorder and therefore being first well satisfied that the virulence is entirely removed recourse must be had to the cold bath and the following strengthening pills must be taken twice or three times in a day four at each dose with a glass of old red port wine mixed with water  receipt to make the strengthening pills take roch alum three drachms dragonsblood one dram melt them together over the fire then powder them and add ten grains of sugar of lead then make them into middle sized pills with as much chio turpentine as is sufficient to give the mass a proper consistence if the gleet does not give way to the use of these pills joined with cold bathing a little of the following injection must be thrown up the yard with a syringe night and morning  receipt to make the injection take three drachms of the compound ceruss powder and one scruple of camphor dissolve them in twelve ounces of limewater for an injection  n b great care must be taken that the ceruss powder is reduced into as fine a powder as possible  but whereas many persons after a perfect cure of the clap and a total suppression of all gleety ouzings are subject to a lankness of their testicles whereby the left generally hangs lower than the right and both of them much lower than their natural position requires they should this is a certain indication of great weakness and feebleness in the constitution of these parts for the relief of which the following fomentation will be the most efficacious remedy that can possibly be made use of  receipt for making the restringent fomentation take oak bark three ounces roch alum half an ounce boil them together in a quart of smiths forgewater till one half is wasted away then strain off the liquor and foment the parts with it twice a day as warm as it can be borne it is almost impossible to conceive how much it will restore the tone of the testicles and oblige the scrotum to purse up and contract its dimensions especially if the strengthening pills are taken inwardly at the same time  another consequence of a virulent clap which sometimes happens where the disorder has been very stubborn is a shooting pain in the urinary passage attended with a sensation in the nut of the yard as if a drop of the gleety matter was actually falling from it but upon looking there is not the least sign of any moisture whatsoever this is occasioned from the extreme weakness tenderness and sensibility of the nerves distributed to the urinary passage and if persons thus affected will have but a little patience they will in a very little time perceive this uneasiness by the assistance of the cold bath daily decrease and entirely vanish away in three weeks or a month at farthest  and thus i close the first part of this treatise concerning the cause and cure of the virulent gonorrhaea or clap under all its symptoms and degrees till it vitiates the blood and juices and produces all the various branches of the french pox the description and cure of which shall be the subject of the second part  part second of the grand or french pox in the former part i have so fully treated of every thing that relates to the cure of a virulent clap that i cannot recollect any material circumstance omitted which might be judged necessary in the cure of that branch of the venereal disease for the reader will perceive that i have not only given the proper methods to relieve the most inveterate symptoms of a clap but also the most effectual means to restore the constitution to its former strength and the suffering parts to their former tone and vigor  having therefore accomplished every thing necessary in the cure of a clap i shall proceed to treat of all the particular circumstances of the second infection or french pox from the first and slightest attack it makes upon the constitution to its last and most deplorable symptoms where the disease becomes universal and the patient too frequently sinks under the most excruciating tortures  when the venereal disease first appeared in europe it was reputed epidemic and contagious but it is now known by undoubted experience and the unanimous consent of physicians that it can neither be contracted by any error in diet the fault of the air or any spontaneous corruption of the humors but solely by infection and the communication of it from one that is diseased it is therefore mostly if not solely communicated by the immediate contact of one diseased with some part of a sound person as by coition by the breast by lewd kissing by introducing the finger into the places infected by a venereal ulcer or flux if there happens to be a hangnail on the finger or some little cut or erasement of the skin it also often arises from the long continuance of a virulent clap the unseasonable use of astringents or the unskilful application of styptic injections whereby the pocky venom that ought to discharge itself through the urinary passage in form of a running is too hastily suppressed and the insectious matter is thrown upon the constitution and infects the blood and juices  the difference of the symptoms have a great dependence upon the influence of the pocky venom whereby they are either mild corrosive or extremely malignant though sometimes the vicious juices of the body occasion a variety of untoward symptoms even in cases where originally the pocky venom was very mild this happens in bodies highly scorbutic that live much upon high seasoned meats rich wines and other hot inflammatory diet which fire the blood sharpen the humors and render the pocky symptoms more corrosive and malignant  the safety or danger of the patient very much depends upon the greatness or severity of the symptoms the multitude of the parts affected and the necessity of those parts to life when the symptoms are few and do not affect the parts essential to life provided the venereal venom does not lay hold of the bones we may judge the cure will be easily and speedily effected a more favorable issue may be expected from a pox attended with a virulent running than from a dry pox without that circumstance attending it as also from a pox contracted in youth than in old people it is always a good sign and promises well to the patient where the scabs and breakingout appear full on the habit and their heads rise with an eminence above the skin and the want of vital force is the sole reason why this disease so frequently terminates in the scurvy asthma or dropsy in aged people  the cure of an hereditary pox is very difficult but not impossible the same may be concluded of an infant that suckles an infected nurse a pox of long standing in a strong healthful young man is easier to cure than a fresh pox in a weakly scorbutic or hectical constitution though an inveterate pox is very troublesome and difficult to relieve even under the best constitutions  signs of the second infection or grand pox buboes in the groin and chancres on the private parts make the first degree of this distemper the skin especially about the neck and breast and between the shoulders is covered with flat spots like freckles of a yellow or livid color it is full of itchy pustules tetters ringworms and serpiginous eruptions there are chaps in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet with itching from whence proceeds a clear liquor like water it abounds with hard callous round pustules rising a little at the top generally dry but sometimes moist scaly branny and yellow frequently on the corners of the lips and the sides of the nostrils but more especially on the forehead temples and behind the ears where they appear in rows like a string of beads and gradually creep among the hair the inside of the mouth throat and nose are also affected the palate and glands of the throat become hot painful inflamed and ulcerated pustules appear in the roof of the mouth which degenerate into round malignant phagaedenic ulcers which rot the bone as far as the nostrils the membrane which lines the inside of the nostrils is likewise liable to pustules which produce ulcerations that infect the bones of the nose with a caries which being eaten away the nose falls down having lost its support the voice becomes hoarse and low the gums ulcerate and rot the teeth ach grow rotten and fall out and the breath is very offensive the miserable patient is tormented with pains in the night time when in bed and covered warm with clothes which become so intense that the patient cannot lie in bed these are either tensive pricking pulsative or rending fixed or wandering which sometimes occupy the muscular and tendious parts like the rheumatism sometimes the tendons and ligaments about the joints resembling the gout sometimes they are with swelling or inflammation sometimes without at the dawn of the morning these pains remit and become more tolerable till the succeeding evening again exasperates the pains and renews the tragedy which circumstance distinguishes venereal from all rheumatic gouty or scorbutic pains whatever all these symptoms gradually increase afterward nodes or exostoses arise on the skull shinbones and bones of the arms which being attended with constant pain and inflammation at length grow carious and rotten the lymphatic glands become hard and callous and form in the neck armpits groin and mesentery hard moveable circumscribed swellings like the kings evil the lymphatic vessels being enlarged by a thick stagnating lymph form swellings which are called gummata in the tendons it causes nodes in the nerves ganglions and in the ligaments of the joints tophs  neither do the eyes escape the fury of this disease for they are externally affected with pain redness itching and lippitude and internally being loaded with humors suppuration sometimes happens and the sight is destroyed the ears are affected with a singing noise deafness and pain while their internal substance is ulcerated and rendered carious  women have disorders peculiar to the sex as cancers in the breast a suppression or overflowing of the monthly courses the whites the hysteric passion an inflammation abscess schirrus gangrene ulcer and cancer of the womb they are either barren or subject to miscarry or the children they bring into the world have an universal erysipelas are half rotten and covered with ulcers  after this catalogue of symptoms it is no wonder that all the animal vital and natural functions should be depraved and that the unhappy sufferer should fall into a decay and at last worn out with pain die consumptive  management of the patient in relation to diet exercise etc while under the cure of the venereal disease a thin cooling attenuating diet is certainly the most proper to soften the blood and resolve the scurfy scabs which defile the skin and for this end nothing is preferable to ptisans made of sarsaparilla with milk in case the person is of a dry hectical constitution or a decoction of guaicum if he is cold or moist and consequently inclinable to breed phlegm he may eat milk light puddings eggs either boiled or poached chickenbroth mutton or veal broth chocolate tea water gruel etc if any wine is drank it should be diluted with bristolwater and this method should be continued till the cure is fully completed great care must be taken through the whole course of the cure never to indulge in any excess for a little error committed on this head will certainly prove of very pernicious consequence all violent exercise ought to be avoided as riding jumping etc for though the pox is a chronic disease and upon that account may seem to require some degree of motion or exercise yet it is frequently attendwith violent symptoms of an inflammation for which reason i should advise the patient never to use more exercise if it could possibly be avoided than moderate walking or gentle riding in a coach or chaise for the benefit of the clear serene air which is of great efficacy in the cure of the venereal disease the government of the passions is of the last consequence for it is not possible to make any considerable progress in the cure unless the sick person is resolved to prevent their breaking out in irregular excursions it therefore highly concerns the patient above all other things not to suffer his fancy to rove after women who should never come into sight if possible during the time he is under cure for these irregular desires from wanton objects will retard the cure and occasion those symptoms which some time before disappeared to return with greater fury  chap vii cure of venereal ulcers which affect the nose palate throat and parts adjoining having in the preceding part of this treatise fully treated of the cure of venereal chancres and buboes in the groins of either sex we shall now consider the most proper method to relieve and thoroughly eradicate those ulcers which affect the throat and parts adjoining in these cases most authors have advised a strong salivation to be raised with all possible speed and indeed this symptom of the venereal disease seems much more likely to be relieved by a salivation than any other species of that disorder since in this case the pocky ulcers and scabs being near the salival ducts are immediately dissolved and carried off by the salivation without passing again into the blood and mixing with the juices nevertheless if the following method be carefully pursued i am persuaded these symptoms may be as perfectly cured as if the patient underwent that disagreeable and tedious course  to abate the inflammation of the parts bleeding to the amount of ten or twelve ounces will be necessary and the parts affected should be washed frequently with the following gargle  receipt for the gargle take a quarter of an ounce of red rose leaves dired and infuse them in a pint of boiling water add ten drops of oil of vitriol and when cold sweeten it with three quarters of an ounce of loaf sugar  take half a pint of this infusion one ounce and an half of honey of roses and half an ounce of mel aegyptiacum mix them all together for a gargle to be used frequently as above directed  internally the mercurial pills directed under the article of the virulent clap or gonorrhaea must be taken night and morning till the ulcers are entirely healed drinking after each dose half a pint of the following diet drink mixed with a little milk lukewarm  receipt for preparing the diet drink take sarsaparilla and guaicum shavings each two ounces stick liquorice one ounce boil them together in two quarts of lime water till one half is wasted away then strain off the residue for use  lime water is made by pouring a gallon of boiling water on a pound of quick lime and letting it stand till the water is cold when it must be carefully poured off from the lime and kept in a stone bottle well corked  after these measures have been taken some time and the complaints are gone off i would advise instead of the pills the following electuary to be taken the quantity of a nutmeg night and morning with half a pint of the diet drink after each dose to sweeten the blood and prevent a return of the pocky complaints  receipt for the alterative electuary take aethiops mineral and gum guaicum each half an ounce camphor a scruple conserve of roses one ounce mix them together into an electuary with as much syrup of orange peels as is necessary to give it a proper consistence  n b this electuary should be taken three weeks or a month  these remedies generally effect a certain and successful cure but in some stubborn cases where the disorder is very malignant and has taken deep root the ulcers will be apt to spread notwithstanding all you have done for their relief in which case the mouth and throat must be fumigated with the smoke of artificial cinnabar every night at least for four or five nights running and then if no spitting ensues and the ulcers seem likely to heal the pills and diet drink must be made use of as above directed  receipt for the fumigating powder take vermillion and frankincense each half an ounce rub them together into a gross powder and divide them into eight papers one of which is sufficient for one fumigation the method of fumigating is by putting a paper of this powder on a red hot iron or heater and placing a tin funnel inverted on the heater then the patient receives the smoke into his mouth through the small end of the funnel which at first he may bear for six or eight minutes at each time lengthning the time a little after the fumigation is over a glass of mulled wine is proper to support the spirits  chap viii cure of venereal eruptions and ulcers which affect the skin and flesh in different parts of the body when the venereal disease is diffused through the whole habit and taints the skin and flesh with serpiginous eruptions when pustules and pocky warts beset the forehead sides of the face lips chin ampc when scabbs and spreading tettars affect the arms breast shoulders back and thighs when foul ulcers occupy the neck loins and legs attended with severe night pains in the bones of the arms and legs as if dogs were gnawing of them which go off toward morning regularly under these circumstances nothing can be done better than to assist nature to throw off the tainted juices as much as possible by the cuticular discharges  gentle purges in the beginning of the cure are very serviceable such as the following  take ten grains of calomel and make it into a pill with a little bit of conserve of roses this should be taken over night and workt off with the following purging draught  take three ounces of the infusion of senna and half an ounce of syrup of buckthorn mix them into a draught this pill and draught may be repeated four or sive times after which i recommend the mercurial pills directed under the article of the virulent gonorrhaea or clap to be taken night and morning drinking after each dose half a pint of the diet drink prepared as directed in the preceding article as warm as possible between whiles the patient should make use of the warm bath since nothing so powerfully moistens and softens the fibers of the skin and as warm bathing renders the perspiration freer and more full it consequently removes the obstructions and assists greatly the dissolution of the pocky matter so that by the assistance of the warm bath the time of cure is very much shortened the method here laid down if strictly attended to and accompanied with a sparing regular way of living will in the worst cases effect a certain cure without the least necessity of having recourse to that disagreeable and dangerous remedy a salivation sometimes the eruptions blotches ulcers ampc may require some topical application the best is the following ointment a little of which may be spread on a piece of fine rag and applied to the larger eruptions etc once in a day which in a little time will disperse them  receipt for the detergent ointment take a quarter of an ounce of quicksilver and dissolve it in as much spirit of nitre as will serve for that purpose then add by degrees a quarter of a pound of melted hogs lard and mix them into an ointment  when the cure is fully completed the patient must be very careful not to expose himself too suddenly to the cold air if the weather is extremely sharp least from a too sudden constriction of the fibers of the skin occasioned by the intense cold he should be affected with rheumatic pains frequently more tormenting and more difficult to be removed than those occasioned by the venereal disease he must also be very careful of endangering his constitution by running into excesses of eating drinking etc least from a high way of living the scabs blotches eruptions etc that disappeared under the preceding course of medicine should spring up again under the form of pustules and ulcers equally troublesome to the patient and more hard to be cured than those which arose from the effects of the venereal poison  chap ix cure of nocturnal pains in the head arms legs and other parts of the body arising from a venereal cause if the patient will strictly confine himself to a slender and regular diet the mercurial pills directed under the article of the virulent gonorrhaea or clap accompanied with the decoction of sarsaparilla prepared and given in the following manner will relieve in a very short time venereal headachs and nocturnal pains and if persisted in i have great reason to think will always cure without sweating or confinement at all seasons of the year even where a salivation or long continued courses of the decoction of the woods have failed  receipt to prepare the sarsaparilla decoction to three ounces of the sarsaparillaroot as fresh as it can be procured not spoiled with long keeping worms seawater or moisture add three quarts of riverwater and bring it to boil immediately in an open vessel and let it boil away to two pints of the strained liquor that is to about two pounds averdupoize i sometimes add a little liquoriceroot to make it more palatable this quantity must be taken at two or three doses either warm or cold as is most agreeable every twentyfour hours every other day it must be made fresh and what is not used the day it is boiled must be kept in a cold cellar  there is great reason to think that those rheumatic complaints which are so common and obstinate after a mercurial course may be cured by taking regularly for some time the decoction of sarsaparilla agreeable to the well known effects of that medicine which is only to be depended on where mercury has failed or when it is combined with it i mention this because few diseases resist more the power of medicine than this so obstinate indeed they are that often times they will not yield to a second salivation  chap x cure of carious bones from a venereal cause the proper way to relieve all cariated bones is to lay them bare and keep the wound open so long till the rotten parts are by proper applications brought to exfoliate or scale off but as in this case it is impossible for the sick person to dispense with the attendance of a skilful surgeon i shall not enter into farther particulars on this subject  chap xi cure of a consumption from a venereal cause in the first place let the patient make choice of a fine clear soft air a light thin spare diet such as both contains a large quantity of nourishment in a little compass and is at the same time easy of digestion such as asses milk jellies of hartshorn calves feet sago etc newlaid eggs chocolate welfleet oysters viper broths and crawfish soops for these thin softning and nourishing meats attenuate the viscid juices and give time for the medicines employed in the cure to open the obstructions and remove the hectic fever the following is an excellent broth in consumptive cases  receipt for making the restorative broth take two dried vipers sliced into small bits three crawfish bruised two ounces of pearl barley a crust of bread a little mace and salt and boil them together over a gentle fire in two quarts of water till one half is wasted away strain off the remainder for use of this broth half a pint may be taken every morning at two of the clock in the afternoon and at supper time nothing affords greater nourishment than this broth though it is plain and simple and not stuffed with a load of ingredients which ofther pall the appetite and load the stomach than do any real service  as the patient gathers strength and his appetite increases half a chicken or a bit of neck of mutton may be added to this broth i would advise a couple of large issues to be made between the shoulders just below the nape of the neck which always prove of great service by draining the lungs of the pocky particles which minister fresh supply for the foul expectoration when by these means the hectic fever is something abated and the strength in some measure repaired the cure must be attempted with the following gentle course two or three grains of calomel made into a bolus with conserve of roses must be taken night and morning drinking half a pint of the sarsaparilla decoction prepared as already directed after each bolus for sarsaparilla in emaciated and consumptive habits from a venereal cause is the greatest restorer of appetite color flesh and vigor yet known if the stomach will bear it the other pint of the decoction should be taken mixed with some new milk at intermediate times every day by pursuing these means with care the patient will be restored to his former health again without the least fear of a relapse  chap xi means to restore a broken constitution whether impaired by the severity of the venereal disease or shattered by the violence of quackmedicines the signs of a broken constitution are a great weakness in the loins with a pain in the small of the back a wasting away wandering pains in the head back and breast under the ribs cold clammy sweats frequently break out about the forehead temples and neck flushings in the face especially after eating a great weakness and frigidity of the private parts tremblings and sudden twitchings often in a day seize the nerves tendons and muscles of the face mouth arms and legs attended with a weakness in the joints a dizziness and swimming of the head a lowness and faintness of spirits the body is generally costive the stools are of a clay like nature and come away in small pieces lik dogs turds the urine is thick and foul and lets fall a sediment which appears through the urine as if threads were lying in the bottom of the chamber pot sometimes the surface of the urine is covered with a greasy scum which in cold weather will congeal like a thin cake of fat this arises from the oily parts of the blood melting down and discharging by the urinary passages a profuse stubborn gleet attends some a dribling of urine accompanied with hot shooting pains others the pulse is weak and soft and from any slight motion beats quicker more unequal and as it were in an hurry the digestion is bad so that the patient is miserably oppressed with wind which if it does not go off by frequent belchings occasions severe cholics  to relieve the patient under these infirmities we must first endeavor to restore the tone of the stomach for which purpose i advise the following stomachic draught to be taken every other day from which i have often found wondesul effects  receipt for the stomachic draught take tincture of rhubarb prepared with wine and tincture of hiera picra each ten drachms lavender drops one dram mix them together into a draught  after this has been taken some time to complete the cure i recommend the use of the cold bath and the following restorative tincture  receipt for the restorative tincture take two ounces of the best peruvian bark in gross powder one ounce and an half of dried orangepeels three drachms of virginia snakeroot four scruples of saffron two scruples of cochineal infuse them together in a pint and a quarter of brandy in a vessel close stopped for a week then strain off the tincture for use  a large spoonful of this tincture may be taken two or three times in a day drinking after each dose a glass of water with ten drops of acid elixir of vitriol in it  this tincture tends to strengthen the solids to prevent the further dissolution of the blood restores its crasis and in the end whether the nervous or vascular system be affected is the most powerful restorative in nature and most likely to complete the cure in all broken
