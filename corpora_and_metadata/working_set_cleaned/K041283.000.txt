chesterfield etc o chesterfield my patron and my pride in whom does all that is great and good reside noble by birth by liberal arts refined delight of heaven and darling of mankind the public patriot and the private friend to hated indolence no more impute the muses silence if hereafter mute she quits her former toils for future ease and checks that genius which perhaps might please it is time my fruitless labors to decline when all mens works can climb the stage but mine when in my stead behold a motley herd of upstart witlings to my self preferred not so when booth wilks cibber ruled the stage dramatick ornaments of this our age my small attempts to please were then approved and not for every trifling farce removed booth ever showed me friendship and respect and wilks would rather forward than reject even cibber terror to the scribbling crew would often solicit me for something new now younger rulers younger authors take these handy hirelings can in half a day steal a new ballad farce from some old play to mangled scraps of many an ancient tune tagg feetless jingle jarring and jejune the jaded playrs with equal haste rehearse till sing song limps to horrid hobbling verse though blunder follows blunder line by line the squire is taught to think it is wondrous fine it suits his taste he gives his plaudit voice and shows his understanding in his choice framing conceptions both of men and things just as sir figg directs his leadingstrings sir figg grand master of the double sneer who when he most deceives seems most sincere dissembler born but much improved by art a friendly aspect an infernal heart the mischievous the busy go between easy squire ambsace and sly harlequin who like two wrangling counselors at bar but yet in private like dear friends caress and form designs poor players to distress woe to the stage if once their schemes succeed actors will then be abject slaves indeed poets had better lay their pens aside than tamely truckle to stage tyrants pride who vain and partial keep old authors down to force their own low trumpry on the town why to such wretches should i yield my cause so lately honored with so much applause my little ballads still on every tongue are in politest conversation sung nor can severest censure trace one line that tends to vice in any verse of mine to please and yet instruct is all my aim let venal poetasters boast the same whose utmost views are to corrupt the taste to sooth the vicious and to shock the chaste and quite estranged to any sense of shame make women speak what rakes would blush to name then in excuse plead nothing else goes down a wretched compliment upon the town wretched as false  the towns not so depraved were authors and were actors less enslaved could one good piece be suffered to appear the town would gladly lend a candid ear prefer pure nature and the simple scene to all the monkey tricks of harlequin the man of taste proves this assertion true we want what is rational as well as new but this declension of the british stage booth britains roscius justly did presage that rules dramatic humor taste and wit must to that monster pantomime submit yet pantomime in all its grandeur dressed is but a pompous puppetshew at best then farewell stage be business now my boast with what was irksome once delighted most pleased and contented with my little store i scorn to prostitute my muse for more alas what fame what gain can i propose when others father fast as i compose to such a pitch is pert presumption grown it is well if this poor piece be thought my own so when long since in simple sonnet lays i made the prentice sing his sallys praise though rude the numbers yet the subject moved immortal addison the song approved then prejudice with envy did combine because twas good twas thought too good for mine so common fame did various authors choose to namby pamby offspring of my muse till pope who ever proved to truth a friend with generous ardour did my cause defend traced me obscure and in detractions spite displayed me in a more conspicuous light to mention more would prove a needless task why should they not be mine that is all i ask because i am cheerful unreservd and free can nothing good or new proceed from me what have i done injurious to mankind my works must be to other men assigned well let em go i all my right resign entirely easy had they never been mine yet this reflection consolates my fate i see my error ever it proves too late no more half mazed i hurry through the town with magazines of projects in my crown while pyrate printers rob me of my gain and reap the labored harvest of my brain like other men i walk a common pace nor run through london one continued race but know when where and what i am to do you will think it is strange my lord but yet it is true thrice welcome sweet tranquillity of mind i now a treasure in contentment find can labor or relax when ever i please and boast i have once enjoyed a moments ease of all a moderate man can wish possessed but most in such a godlike patron blessed beneath the sacred sanction of whose name i build my present peace my future fame finis
