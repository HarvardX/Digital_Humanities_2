clio founded in justice was his sway ambition never marked his way  calliope unless the best ambition that can fire a monarchs breast and all his soul inspire the generous purpose of the noble mind the best ambition  to serve human kind  apollo yes virgins yes that wish sublime ranked him with those of earliest time who for a peoples welfare strove whose spirits breathe aetherial air and for their meed of earthly care drink nectar with olympian jove  calliope oh truth fair daughter of the sky and mercy  that with asking eye near the omnipotent do stand and when mankind provoke his rage do

her dishevelled hair majesty now no more still on the sullen wave her eye is bent the trident of the main thrown idle by old thames his seagreen mantle rent inverts his urn and heaves a doleful sigh hark to the winds and waves frantic with grief she raves and cruel gods she cries each chalky cliff around each rock returns the sound and cruel gods replies  calliope see the procession sad and slow walks in a solemn pomp of woe through awful arches gloomy isles and rows of monumental piles where lie the venerable just where heroes moulder into dust now quietly inurnd he lies pale pale inanimate and cold where round him baleful vapors rise midst bones of legislators old  clio of him who sought the ambitious gaul oer thickembattled plains who felt who lived and reigned for all this only now remains  apollo bring in handfuls lillies bring bring me all the flowery spring scatter roses on his bier ever honored ever dear  chorus scatter roses etc  mercury descends no more harmonious progeny

sovereign pow the power of doing good  mars now open all your helicon explore of harmony the loftiest store let the drum beat alarms such as rouse us to arms the trumpets shrill clangor shall pierce through the sky swell the rapture swell it high and in notes sublime and clear pour the strong melody that heaven may hear  apollo nothing mortal will i found lo the flame the flame divine high i mount i quit the ground holy fury i am thine with rage possessed big swells my breast in visions rapt before my sight appears a brighter order of increasing years  mars i see the rhine devolve his flood deepcrimsond with the gallic blood i hear i hear the distant roar of ruin on yon hostile shore i see young prince to thee i see the savage indian bend the knee lo afric from her sable kings her richest stores in tribute brings and farthest ind beneath the rising day lays down her arms and venerates thy sway  calliope i see bellona banished far i see him close the gates of war while purple rage within with ghastly ire shall grin and rolling his terrific eyes where round him heaps of arms arise bound with a hundred brazen chains in vain shall foam and thirst for sanguine plains  clio sweet peace returns over albions sons she waves her dovelike wing on every plain the shepherd train their artless loves shall sing pale discord shall fly from the light of the sky to black cocytus hurled there there shall feel ixions wheel the furies with their serpents curled with the unceasing toil shall groan of the unconquerable stone and leave in harmony the british world  apollo proceed great days lead on the auspicious years such years   for lo the scene of fate appears such years the destinies have said shall roll jove nods consent and thunder shakes the pole  finis postscript it
