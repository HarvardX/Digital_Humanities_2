an essay upon prints containing remarks upon the principles of picturesque beauty the different kinds of prints and the characters of the most noted masters illustrated by criticisms upon particular pieces to which are added some cautions that may be useful in collecting prints  artificumque manus inter se operumque labores miramur aen i     london printed for j robson bookseller to the princess

in the spring notwithstanding the following work a few additions excepted has lain by the author at least fifteen years it is very far from being so perfect as he could have wished any new lights therefore and information he will be glad to receive through the hands of his bookseller in many things he fears he may have passed wrong judgments and in some points he has not had all the means of information which he could have desired for as he has taken nothing upon trust with regard to the characters of masters he sometimes wanted the opportunity he wished for of consulting their works  since his work was printed the author has seen a dictionary of engravers ancient and modern in three volumes published by f basan engraver at paris which seems to be accurate and might in some points have been of service to him it contains a very numerous catalogue of engravers the more eminent of whom only are taken notice of in the following pages of modern prints the author has purposely said little declining generally to give his opinion of living artists  he thought it necessary to introduce his work by a few observations on the principles of painting as far as those principles can be applied to prints as these observations are not always new he has endeavored at least to make them concise  in his account of artists he has paid some attention to chronology but has in many cases purposely neglected it with a view of bringing those masters together whose manners are alike  the chapter containing criticisms on particular prints is an addition to his original plan he was advised to insert something of this kind as an illustration of his principles  n b when the figures on the right side are spoken of those are meant which are opposite to the spectators right and so of the

an agreeable form given in a picture to a clownish figure repose or quietness applied to a picture when the whole is harmonious when nothing glares either in the light shade or coloring to keep down

lights strong lights which strike upon some particular parts of an object the rest of which is in shadow studies the scetched ideas of a painter not wrought into a whole freedom the result of quick

principles of painting considered as far as they relate to prints chap ii observations on the different kinds of prints chap iii characters of the most noted masters chap iv remarks on particular prints chap v cautions in collecting prints chapter i the principles of painting considered so far as they relate to prints a painting or picture is distinguished from a print only by the coloring and the manner of execution in other respects the foundation of beauty is the same in both and we consider a print as we do a picture in a double light with regard to a whole and with regard to its parts it may have an agreeable effect as a whole and yet be very culpable in its parts it may be likewise the reverse a man may make a good appearance upon the whole though his limbs examined separately may be wanting in exact proportion his limbs on the other hand may be exactly formed and yet his person upon the whole disgusting  to make a print agreeable as a whole a just observance of those rules is necessary which relate to design disposition keeping and the distribution of light to make it agreeable in its parts of those which relate to drawing expression grace and perspective  by design a term which painters sometimes use in a more limited sense i mean the general conduct of the piece as a representation of such a particular story it answers in an historical relation of a fact to a judicious choice of circumstances and includes a proper time proper characters the most affecting manner of introducing those characters and proper appendages  with regard to a proper time the painter is assisted by good old dramatic rules which inform him that one point of time only should be taken  the most affecting in the action and that no other part of the story should interfere with it thus in the death of ananias if the instant of his falling down be chosen no anachronism should be introduced every part of the piece should correspond each character should be under the strongest impression of astonishment and horror those passions being yet unallayed by any cooler passions succeding  with regard to characters the painter must suit them to his piece by attending to historical truth if his subject be history or to heathen mythology if it be fabulous  he must farther introduce them properly they should be ordered in such an advantageous manner that the principal figures those which are most concerned in the action should catch the eye first and engage it most this is an essential ingredient in a welltold story in the first place they should be the least embarrassed of the group this alone gives them distinction but they may be farther distinguished sometimes by a broad light sometimes though but rarely and when the subject requires it by a strong shadow in the midst of a light sometimes by a remarkable action or expression and sometimes by a combination of two or three of these modes of distinction  the last thing included in design is the use of proper appendages by appendages are meant animals landscape buildings and in general what ever is introduced into the piece by way of ornament every thing of this kind should correspond with the subject and rank in a proper subordination to it bassan would sometimes paint a scripturestory and his method was to crowd his foreground with cattle well painted indeed but wholly foreign to his subject while you seek for his principal figures and at length perhaps with difficulty find them in some remote corner of his picture we often see a landscape well adorned with a story in miniature the landscape here is principal but at the same time the figures which tell the story though subordinate to the landscape are the principal figures bassans practice was different in his pictures neither the landscape nor the story is principal his cattle are the ornament of his pieces to introduce a story then is absurd  when all these rules are observed when a proper point of time is chosen when characters corresponding with the subject are introduced and these ordered so judiciously as to point out the story in the strongest manner and lastly when all the appendages and underparts of the piece are suitable and subservient to the subject then the story is well told and of course the design is perfect  the second thing to be considered with regard to a whole is disposition by this word is meant the art of grouping the figures and of combining the several parts of a picture design considers how each part separately taken concurs in producing a whole  a whole arising from the unity of the subject not the effect of the object for the figures in a piece may be so ordered as to tell the story in an affecting manner which is as far as design goes and yet may want that agreeable combination which is necessary to please the eye to produce such a combination is the business of disposition in the cartoon of st paul preaching at athens the design is perfect and the characters in particular are so ordered as to tell the story in a very affecting manner yet the several parts of the picture are far from being agreably combined if rubens had had the disposition of the materials of this picture and the management of the lights it is effect as a whole had been very different  having thus distinguished between design and disposition i shall explain the latter a little farther  it is an obvious principle that one object at a time is enough to engage either the senses or the intellect hence the necessity of unity or a whole in painting the eye upon a complex view must be able to comprehend the picture as one object or it cannot be satisfied it may be pleased indeed by feeding on the parts separately but a picture which can please no otherwise is as poor a production as a machine the springs and wheels of which are finished with nicety but are unable to act in concert and effect the intended movement  now disposition or the art of grouping and combining the figures and several parts of a picture is an essential which contributes greatly to produce a whole in painting when the parts are scattered they have no dependence on each other they are still only parts but by an agreeable grouping they are massed together and become a whole  in disposing figures great artifice is necessary to make each group open itself in such a manner as to set off advantageously the several figures of which it is composed the action at least of each figure should appear  no group can be agreeable without contrast by contrast is meant the opposition of one part to another a sameness in attitude action or expression among figures in the same group will always disgust the eye in the cartoon of st paul preaching at athens the contrast among the figures is incomparably fine and the want of it in the death of ananias makes the group of the apostles a disagreeable one  nor indeeed is contrast required only among the figures of the same group but also among the groups themselves and among all the parts of which the piece is composed in the beautiful gate of the temple the figures of the principal group are very well contrasted but the adjoining group is disposed almost in the same manner which together with the formal pillars introduce a disagreable regularity into the picture  the judicious painter however whether he group combine or contrast will always avoid the appearance of artifice the several parts of his picture will be so suited to each other that his art will seem the result of chance in the sacrifice at lystra the head of the ox is bowed down with a design no doubt to group the figures around it more harmoniously but their action is so well suited to the posture of the ox and the whole managed with so much judgment that although the figures are disposed with the utmost art they appear with all the ease of nature the remaining part of the group is an instance of the reverse in which a number of heads appear manifestly stuck in to fill up vacuities  but farther as a whole or unity is an essential of beauty that disposition is certainly the most perfect which admits but of one group all subjects however will not allow this close observance of unity when this is the case the several groups must again be combined chiefly by a proper distribution of light so as constitute a whole  but as the whole will soon be lost if the constituent parts become numerous it follows that many groups must not be admitted judicious painters have thought three the utmost number that can be allowed some subjects indeed as battles and triumphs necessarily require a great number of figures and of course various combinations of groups in the management of such subjects the greatest art is necessary to preserve a whole confusion in the figures must be expressed without confusion in the picture a writer should treat his subject clearly though he write upon obscurity  with regard to disposition i shall only add that the shape or form of the group should also be considered the triangular form michael angelo thought the most beautiful and indeed there is a lightness in it which no other form can receive the group of the apostles in the cartoon of giving the keys and the same group in the death of ananias are both exceedingly heavy and this heaviness arises from nothing more than from the form of a parallelogram within the lines of which these groups are contained the triangular form too is capable of the most variety for the vertical angle of a group so disposed may either be acute or obtuse in any degree or a segment only of a triangle may be taken which still increases the variety the cartoons afford few instances of beauty in the forms of groups in the works of salvator rosa we frequently find them  the painter when he has chosen his subject should always scetch out some beautiful form of grouping which may best suit it within which bounds he should as nearly as may be without affectation confine his figures what i mean is that the form of the group should never be left at random  a third thing to be considered in a picture with regard to a whole is keeping this word implies the different degrees of strength and faintness which objects receive from nearness and distance a nice observance of the gradual fading of light and shade contributes greatly toward the production of a whole without it the distant parts instead of being connected with the objects at hand appear like foreign objects wildly introduced and unconnected diminished in size only they put you in mind of lilliput and brobdignag united in one scene keeping is generally found in great perfection in della bellas prints and the want of it as conspicuously in tempestas  nearly allied to keeping is the doctrine of harmony which equally contributes toward the production of a whole in painting the practice of this doctrine has amazing force a judicious arrangement of according tints will strike even the unpracticed eye the effect of every picture in a great measure depends on one principal and mastertint which prevails over the whole sometimes the purple tint is chosen sometimes the mellow brown one and in some subjects the greenish hue is most proper of this ruling tint whatever it is every object in the picture should in a degree participate this theory is founded on principles of truth and produces a fine effect from the harmony in which it unites every object  but although harmony shows its effect chiefly in painting yet in some measure the effect of prints may be assisted by it unless they are harmonized by the same tone of shadow if i may so express myself there will always appear a great deficiency in them by the same tone of shadow i mean not only the same manner of execution but an uniform degree of strength we often meet with hard touches in a print which standing alone are unharmonious but when every contiguous part is touched up to that tone the whole is in unison  keeping then proportions a proper degree of strength to the near and distant parts in respect to each other harmony goes a step farther and keeps each part quiet with respect to itself and the whole i shall only add that in scetches and rough etchings no harmony is expected it is enough if keeping be observed harmony is looked for only in finished compositions if you would see the want of it in the strongest light examine a wornprint harshly retouched by some bungler  the last thing which contributes to produce a whole is a proper distribution of light this in a print especially is most essential an harmony in the coloring may in some measure supply its place in painting but a print has no succidaneum were the design disposition and keeping ever so perfect beautiful and just without this essential instead of a whole we should have only a piece of patchwork nay such is the power of light that by an artificial management of it we may even harmonize a bad disposition  the general rule which regards the distribution of light is that it should be spread in large masses this gives us the idea of a whole every grand object catches the light only upon one large surface where the light is spotted we have the idea of several objects or at least of an incoherent one if the object be single which the eye surveys with difficulty it is thus in painting when we see upon a comprehensive view large masses of light and shade we have of course the idea of a whole  of unity in that picture but where the light is scattered we have the idea of several objects or at least of one broken and confused titians known illustration of this point by a bunch of grapes is beautiful and explanatory when the light falls upon the whole bunch together one side being illumined and the other dark we have the representation of those large masses which constitute a whole but when the grapes are stripped from the bunch and scattered upon a table the light shining upon each separately a whole is no longer preserved  having thus considered those essentials of a print which produce a whole it remains to consider those which relate to the parts  drawing expression grace and perspective with regard to these let it be first observed that in order they are inferior to the other the production of a whole is the great effect that should be aimed at in a picture a picture without a whole is properly only a study and those things which produce a whole are of course the principal foundation of beauty  by drawing we mean the exactness of the outline without a competent knowledge of this there can be no just representation of nature every thing will be distorted and offensive to the eye bad drawing therefore is that disgusting object which non homines non dii non concessere columnae  drawing however may be very tolerable though it fall short in a certain degree of absolute perfection the defect will only be observed by the most critical and anatomical eye and i may venture to say that drawing is ranked too high when the niceties of it are considered in preference to those essentials which constitute a whole  expression is the life and soul of painting it implies a just representation of passion and of character of passion by exhibiting every emotion of the mind as outwardly discovered by any peculiarity of gesture or the extention and contraction of the features of character by representing the different manners of men as arising from their particular tempers or professions the cartoons are full of examples of the first kind of expression and with regard to the second commonly called mannerspainting it would be invidious not to mention our countryman hogarth whose works contain a variety of characters represented with more force than most men can conceive them  grace consists in such a disposition of the parts of a figure as forms it into an agreeable attitude it depends on contrast and ease contrast when applied to a single figure means the same as when applied to a group the opposition of one part to another it may be considered with reference to the body the limbs and the head the graceful attitude arising sometimes from a contrast in one sometimes in another and sometimes in all with reference to the body contrast consists in giving it an easy turn opposing concave parts to unequal of this st paul in the sacrifice at lystra is an instance  with reference to the limbs it consists in the opposition between extention and contraction michael angelos illustration by a triangle or pyramid may here likewise again be introduced this form giving grace and beauty to a single figure as well as to a group only here a greater liberty may be allowed in grouping the triangle must always rest upon its base but in a single figure it may be inverted and stand upon its apex thus if the lower parts of the figure be extended the upper parts should be contracted but the same beautiful form is given by extending the arms and drawing the feet to a point  lastly contrast often arises from the air of the head which is given by a turn of the neck from the line of the body the cartoons abound with examples of this kind of grace it is very remarkable in the figure of st john healing the cripple and the same cartoon affords eight or nine more instances i say the less on this subject as it has been so well explained by the ingenious author of the analysis of beauty  thus contrast is the foundation of grace but it must ever be remembered that contrast should be accompanied with ease the body should be turned not twisted every constrained posture avoided and every motion such as nature which loves ease would dictate  what has been said on this head relates equally to all figures those drawn from low as well as those from high life and here i would distinguish between picturesque grace and that grace which arises from dignity of character of the former kind which is the kind here treated of all figures should partake you find it in berghems clowns and in callots beggars but it belongs to expression to mark those characteristics which distinguish the latter  i shall only observe farther that when the piece consists of many figures the contrast of each single figure should be subordinate to the contrast of the whole it will be improper therefore in many cases to practice the rules which have been just laid down they ought however to be a general direction to the painter and at least to be observed in the principal figures  if a single figure be introduced as in portrait the pyramidal form cannot well be dispensed with the figure partakes then of the nature of a group  perspective is that proportion with regard to size which near and distant objects with their parts bear to each other it answers to keeping one gives the outline and the other fills it up without a competent knowledge of perspective very absurd things would be introduced and yet to make a vain show of it is pedantic  under this head may be reduced foreshortning unless this be done with the utmost art it were better omitted it will otherwise occasion great aukwardness rubens is famous for foreshortning but the effect is chiefly seen in his paintings seldom in his prints  to this summary of the rules which relate to the whole of a picture and to its parts i shall just add a few observations upon execution which relates equally to both  by execution is meant that manner of working by which each artist produces his effect artists may differ in their execution or manner and yet all excel callot for instance uses a strong firm stroke salvator a slight and loose one while rembrandt executes in a manner different from them both by scratches seemingly at random  every artist is in some degree a mannerist that is he executes in a manner peculiar to himself but the word mannerist has generally a closer sense nature should be the standard of imitation and every object should be executed as nearly as possible in her manner thus salvators figures du jardins animals and waterlos landskips are all strongly impressed with the character of nature other masters again deviating from this standard instead of nature have recourse only to their own ideas they have gotten a general idea of a man a horse or a tree and to these ideas they apply upon all occasions instead therefore of representing that endless variety which nature exhibits on every subject a sameness runs through all their performances every figure and every tree bears the same stamp such artists are properly called mannerists tempest callot and testa are all mannerists of this kind their ideas are plainly no copies from nature perelles landskips too are mere transcripts of imagination  the artist however who copies nature if he make a bad choice as rembrandt often did is less agreeable than the mannerist who gives us his own elevated ideas touched with spirit and character though not with exact truth he is the true artist who copies nature but where he finds her mean elevates her from his own ideas of beauty such was salvator  by the spirit and freedom of execution we mean something which it is difficult to explain a certain heaviness always follows when the artist is not sure of his stroke and cannot execute his idea with precision the reverse is the case when he is certain of it and gives it boldly i know not how to explain better what is meant by spirit mere freedom a quick execution will give but unless that freedom be attended with precision the stroke however free will be so unmeaning as to lose its effect  to these observations it may not be improper to add a short comparative view of the peculiar excellences of pictures and prints which will show us in what points the picture has the advantage  in design and composition the effects of both are equal the print exhibits them with as much force and meaning as the picture  in keeping the picture has the advantage the haziness of distance cannot well be expressed by any thing but the hue of nature which the pencil is very able to give the print endeavors to preserve this haziness and to give the idea but the idea is very imperfect it is little more than an aid to memory we know the appearance exists in nature and the print furnishes an hint to recollect it  in the distribution of light the comparison runs very wide here the painter avails himself of a thousand varied tints which assist him in this business and by which he can harmonize his gradations from light to shade with an almost infinite variety an harmonious coloring has in itself indeed the effect of a proper distribution of light the engraver in the mean time is left to work out his effect with two materials only plain white and black  in the print however you can more easily trace the principles of light and shade the pencil is the implement of deception and it requires the eye of a master to distinguish between the effect of light and the mere effect of color but in the print even the unpractised eye can readily catch the mass and follow the distribution of it through all its variety of middle tints  one thing more may be added on this head if the picture have no harmony in its coloring the tints being all at discord among themselves which is very often the case in the works of reputable painters a good print from such a picture is more beautiful than the picture itself it preserves what is valuable upon a supposition there is any thing valuable in it and removes what is offensive  thus the comparison runs with regard to those essentials which relate to a whole with regard to drawing expression grace and perspective we can pursue it only in the two former in the two latter the picture and the print seem to have equal advantages  with regard to perspective indeed the lines of the print verging all to one point may mark the principles of it more strongly  drawing in a picture is effected by the contiguity of two different colors in a print by a positive line in the picture therefore drawing has more of nature in it and more of effect but the student in anatomy finds more precision in the print and can more easily trace the line and follow it in all its windings through light and shade  in metzotinto indeed the comparison fails in which species of prints drawing is effected nearly as it is in painting  with regard to expression the painter glories in his many advantages the passions receive their force almost as much from color as from the emotion of feature nay lines without color have frequently an effect very opposite to what is intended violent expressions when lineal only become often grotesque the complexion should support the distortion the bloated eyes of immoderate grief degenerate into coarse features unless the pencil add those highblown touches which mark the passion ask the engraver why he could not give the dying saint of dominichino his true expression jac freiis copy of dominichinos st jerome why he gave him that ghastly horror instead of the serene langour of the original the engraver may with justice say he went as far as lines could go but he wanted dominichinos pencil to give those pallid touches which alone could make his lines expressive  age also and sex the bloom of youth and the wan cheek of sickness are equally indebted in representation for their most characteristic marks to the pencil  in portrait the different hues of hair and complexion  in animallife the various dies of furrs and plumage  in landscape the peculiar tints of seasons of morning and evening the light azure of a summers sky the sultry glow of noon the bluish or purple tinge which the mountain assumes as it recedes or approaches the gray moss upon the ruin the variegated greens and mellow browns of foliage and broken ground in short the colors of every part of nature have all amazing force in strengthening the expression of objects  in the room of all this the deficient print has only to offer mere form and the gradations of simple light hence the sweet touches of the pencil of claude mark his pictures with the strongest expressions of nature and render them invaluable while his prints are the dirty shapes of something which he could not express  the idea also of distant magnitude the print gives only very imperfectly it is expressed chiefly by color air which is naturally blue is the medium through which we see and every object participates of this blueness when the distance is small the tinge is imperceptible as it increases the tinge grows stronger and when the object is very remote it entirely loses its natural color and becomes blue and indeed this is so familiar a criterion of distance at least with those who live in mountainous countries that if the object be visible at all after it has received the full ethertinge if i may so speak the sight immediately judges it to be very large the eye ranging over the plains of egypt and catching the blue point of a pyramid from the color concludes the distance and is struck with the magnitude of an object which through such a space can exhibit form  here the print fails this criterion of distant magnitude it is unable to give  the print equally fails when the medium itself receives a foreign tinge from a strength of color behind it the idea of horror impressed by an expanse of air glowing in the night with distant fire cannot be raised by black and white vandervelde has contrived to give us a good idea of the dreadful glare of a fleet in flames but it were ridiculous for an engraver to attempt such a subject because he cannot express that idea which principally illustrates his story  transparency is another thing which the print is very unable to express it is the united tinge of two colors one behind the other each of which in part discovers itself singly if you employ one color only you have the idea of opaqueness a fine carnation is a white transparent skin spread over a multitude of small blood vessels which blush through it when the breath departs these little fountains of life flow no longer the bloom fades and livid paleness the color of death succeeds  the happy pencil can mark both these effects it can spread the glow of health over the cheek of beauty and it can with equal facility express the cold wan tint of human clay the print can express neither representing in the same dry manner the bright transparency of the one and the inert opaqueness of the other  lastly the print fails in the expression of polished bodies which are indebted for their chief luster to reflected colors the print indeed goes farther here than in the case of transparency in this it can do very little in polished bodies it can at least give reflected shapes it can show the forms of hanging woods upon the edges of the lake though it is unable to give the kindred tinge but in many cases the polished body receives the tinge without the shape here the engraver is wholly deficient he knows not how to stain the gleaming silver with the purple liquor it contains nor is he able to give the heros armor its highest polish from the tinge of the crimson vest which covers it  a single word upon the subject of execution shall conclude these remarks here the advantage lies wholly on the side of painting that manner which can best give the idea of the surface of an object is the best and the lines of the finest engraving are harsh in comparison of the smooth flow of the pencil metzotinto though deficient in some respects is certainly in others the happyest manner of execution and the ancient wooden print in which the middle tint is used is undoubtedly in point of execution beyond either etching or engraving  chapter ii observations on the different kinds of prints there are three kinds of prints engravings etchings and metzotintos the characteristic of the first is strength of the second freedom and of the third softness all these however may in some degree be found in each  from the shape of the engravers tool each stroke is an angular incision which form must of course give the line strength and firmness if it be not very tender from such a line also as it is a deliberate one correctness may be expected but no great freedom for it is a labored line ploughed through the metal and must necessarily in a degree want ease  unlimited freedom on the other hand is the characteristic of etching the needle gliding along the surface of the copper meets no resistance and easily takes any turn the hand pleases to give it etching indeed is mere drawing and may be practiced with the same facility  but as aquafortis bites in an equable manner it cannot give the lines that strength which they receive from a pointed graver cutting into the copper besides it is difficult to prevent it is biting the plate all over alike the distant parts indeed may easily be covered with wax and the grand effect of the keeping preserved but to give each smaller part its proper relief and to harmonize the whole requires so many different degrees of strength such easy transitions from one into another that aquafortis alone is not equal to it here therefore engraving has the advantage which by a stroke deep or tender at the artists pleasure can vary strength and faintness in any degree  as engraving therefore and etching have their respective advantages and deficiencies artists have endeavored to unite their powers and correct the faults of each by joining the freedom of the one with the strength of the other in most of our modern prints the plate is first etched and afterward strengthened and finished by the engraver and when this is well done it has a happy effect that flatness which is the consequence of an equable strength of shade is taken off and the print gains a new effect by the relief given to those parts which hang in the painters language upon the parts behind to them  but great art is necessary in this business we see many a print which wanted only a few touches when it appeared in its etched proof receive afterward so many as to become labored heavy and disgustful  it is a rare thing to meet with a print entirely engraved which is free from stiffness a celebrated master of our own indeed has found the art of giving freedom to the stroke of a graver and has displayed great force of execution upon works by no means worthy of him as if he were determined to show the world he could stamp a value upon any thing  but such artists are rarely found mere engravers in general are little better than mere mechanics  in etching we have a greater variety of excellent prints the case is it is so much the same as drawing that we have the very works themselves of the most celebrated masters many of whom have left behind them prints in this way which however slight and incorrect will always have something masterly and of course beautiful in them  in the muscling of human figures of any considerable size engraving has undoubtedly the advantage of etching the soft and delicate transitions from light to shade which are there required cannot be so well expressed by the needle and in general large prints require a strength which etching cannot give and are therefore fit objects of engraving  etching on the other hand is more particularly adapted to scetches and slight designs which if executed by an engraver would entirely lose their freedom and with it their beauty landscape too in general is the object of etching the foliage of trees ruins sky and indeed every part of landscape requires the utmost freedom in finishing an etched landscape with the tool as it is called too much care cannot be taken to prevent heaviness we remarked before the nicety of touching upon an etched plate but in landscape the business is peculiarly delicate the foregrounds may require a few strong touches and the boles of such trees as are placed upon them and here and there a few harmonizing strokes will add to the effect but if the engraver ventures much farther he has good luck if he do no mischief  an engraved plate unless it be cut very slightly will cast off five hundred good impressions an etched one will not give above two hundred unless it be eaten very deep and then it may perhaps give three hundred after that the plate must be retouched or the impressions will be faint  besides the common method of engraving on copper we have prints engraved on pewter and on wood the pewter plate gives a coarseness and dirtiness to the print which is disagreable but engraving upon wood is capable of great beauty of this species of engraving more shall elsewhere be said  metzotinto is very different from either engraving or etching in these you make the shades in metzotinto the lights  since the time of its invention by prince rupert as is commonly supposed the art of scraping metzotintos is greatly more improved than either of its sisterarts some of the earliest etchings are perhaps the best and engraving since the times of goltzius and muller has not perhaps made any very great advances but metzotinto compared with its original state is at this day almost a new art if we examine some of the modern pieces of workmanship in this way the jewish rabbi the portrait of mrs lascelles with a child on her knee mr garrick between tragedy and comedy and several other prints by some of our best metzotintoscrapers they almost as much exceed the works of white and smith as those masters did becket and simons as to prince ruperts works i never saw any which were certainly known to be his but i make no doubt they were executed in the same black harsh disagreable manner which appears so strong in the masters who succeeded the invention however was noble and the early masters have the credit of it but the truth is the ingenious mechanic has been called in to the painters aid and has invented a manner of laying ground wholly unknown to the earlier masters and they who are acquainted with metzotinto know the ground to be a very capital consideration  the characteristic of metzotinto is softness which adapts it chiefly to portrait or history with a few figures and these not too small nothing except paint can express flesh more naturally or the flowing of hair or the folds of drapery or the catching lights of armor in engraving and etching we must get over the prejudices of cross lines which exist on no natural bodies but metzotinto gives us the strongest representation of a surface if however the figures are two crowded it wants strength to detach the several parts with a proper relief and if they are very small it wants precision which can only be given by an outline or as in painting by a different tint the unevenness of the ground will occasion bad drawing and aukwardness  in the extremities especially some inferior artists have endeavored to remedy this by terminating their figures with an engraved or etched line but they have tried the experiment with bad success the strength of the line and the softness of the ground accord ill together i speak not here of such a judicious mixture of etching and metzotinto as white formerly used and such as our best metzotintoscrapers at present use to give a strength to particular parts i speak only of a harsh and injudicious lineal termination  metzotinto excells each of the other species of prints in its capacity of receiving the most beautiful effects of light and shade as it can the most happily unite them by blending them together  of this rembrandt seems to have been aware he had probably seen some of the first metzotintos and admiring the effect endeavored to produce it in etching by a variety of intersecting scratches  you cannot well cast off more than an hundred good impressions from a metzotinto plate the rubbing of the hand soon wears it smooth and yet by constantly repairing it it may be made to give four or five hundred with tolerable strength the first impressions are not always the best they are too black and harsh you will commonly have the best impressions from the fiftieth to the seventieth the harsh edges will be softened down and yet there will be spirit and strength enough left  chapter iii characters of the most noted masters masters in history albert durer though not the inventor was one of the first improvers of the art of engraving he was a german painter and at the same time a man of letters and a philosopher it may be added in his praise that he was an intimate friend of the great erasmus who revised it is supposed some of the pieces which he published he was a man of business also and for many years was the leading magistrate of nuremburgh  his prints considered as the first efforts of a new art have great merit nay we may add that it is astonishing to see a new art in its first essay carried to such a length in some of those prints which he executed on copper the engraving is elegant to a great degree his hellscene particularly which was engraved in the year      is as highfinished a print as ever was engraved and as happily finished the labor he has bestowed upon it has it is full effect in his wooden prints too we are surprised to see in so early a master so much meaning and relief the heads so well marked and every part so well executed  this artist seems to have understood very well the principles of design his composition too is often pleasing and his drawing generally good but he knows very little of the management of light and still less of grace and yet his ideas are purer and more elegant than we could have supposed from the awkward archetypes which his country and education afforded in a word he was certainly a man of a very extensive genius and as vasari remarks would have been an extraordinary artist if he had had an italian instead of a german education his prints are very numerous they were much admired in his own lifetime and eagerly bought up which put his wife who was a teizing woman upon urging him to spend more time upon engraving than he was inclined to do he was very rich and chose rather to practice his art as an amusement than as a business he died in the year       the immediate successors and imitators of albert durer were lucas van leiden aldgrave pens hisben and some others of less note their works are very much in their masters style and were the admiration of an age which had seen nothing better the best of aldgraves works are two or three small pieces of the story of lot  goltzius flourished a little after the death of these masters and carried engraving to a great height he was a native of germany where he learned his art but traveling afterward into italy he there improved his ideas you plainly discover in him a mixture of the flemish and italian schools his forms have sometimes a degree of elegance in them but in general the dutch master predominates goltzius is often happy in design and disposition and fails most in the distribution of light but his chief excellence lies in execution he engraves with a noble firm expressive line which has scarce been excelled by any succeeding masters there is a variety too in his manner which is very pleasing his print of the circumcision is one of the best of his works the story is well told the groups agreably disposed and the execution admirable but the figures are dutch and the whole through the want of a proper distribution of shade is only a glaring mass  muller ingraved very much in the style of goltzius and yet with a still bolder and firmer stroke we have no where greater masterpieces in execution than the works of this artist exhibit the baptism of john is perhaps the most beautiful specimen of bold engraving that is extant  abraham bloemart was a dutch master also and contemporary with goltzius we are not informed what particular means of improvement he had but it is certain he designed in a more elegant taste than any of his countrymen his figures are often graceful excepting only that he gives them sometimes an affected twist which is still more conspicuous in the fingers an affectation which we sometimes also find in the prints of goltzius  the resurrection of lazarus is one of bloemarts master pieces in which are many faults and many beauties both very characteric  while the dutch masters were thus carrying the art of engraving to so great an height it was introduced into italy by andrea mantegna to whom the italians ascribe the invention of it the paintings of this master though they abound in noble passages are formal and disagreable we have a specimen of them at hampton court in the triumph of julius caesar  his prints which are said to have been engraved on tinplates are transscripts from the same ideas we see in them the chaste correct outline and noble simplicity of the roman school but we are to expect nothing more not the least attempt toward an agreeable whole  and indeed we shall perhaps find in general that the masters of the roman school were more studious of those essentials of painting which regard the parts and the flemish masters of those which regard the whole the former therefore drew better figures the latter made better pictures  mantegna was succeeded by parmigiano and palma both masters of great reputation parmigiano having formed the most accurate taste upon a thorough study of the works of raphael and michael angelo published many of his figures rather than designs engraved on wood which abounded with every kind of beauty if we may form a judgment of them from the few which we sometimes meet with whither parmigiano invented the art of engraving upon wood does not certainly appear his pretentions to the invention of etching are less disputable in this way he published many slight pieces which do him great credit in the midst of his labors he was interrupted by a knavish engraver who pillaged him of all his plates unable to bear the loss he foreswore his art and abandoned himself to chemistry  palma was too much employed as a painter to have much leisure for etching he has left however several prints behind him which are remarkable for the delicacy of the drawing and the freedom of the execution he etches in a very loose but masterly manner his prints are scarce and indeed we seldom meet with any that deserve more than the name of scetches  francis paria seems to have copied the manner of palma with great success but his prints are still more scarce than his masters nor have we a sufficient number of them to enable us to form a judgment of his merit  but the great improver of the art of engraving upon wood and who at once carried it to a degree of perfection which has not since been exceeded was andrea andreani of mantua the works of this master are remarkable for the freedom strength and spirit of the execution the elegant correctness of the drawing and in general for their effect few prints come so near the idea of painting they have a force which a pointed tool upon copper cannot reach and the wash of which the middle tint is composed adds all the softness of drawing the works of this master indeed are seldom seen in perfection they are scarce and when we do meet with them it is a chance if the impressions be good and very much of the beauty of these prints depends on the goodness of the impression for often the outline is left hard the middle tint being lost and sometimes the middle tint is left without it is proper termination  among the ancient italian masters we cannot omit mark antonio and augustine of venice they are both celebrated and have handed down to us many engravings from the works of raphael but their antiquity not their merit seems to have recommended them their execution is harsh and formal to the last degree and if their prints give us any idea of the works of raphael we may well wonder as picart observes how that master got his reputation  frederic barocchi was born at urbin where the genius of raphael inspired him in his early youth he traveled to rome and giving himself up to intense study he acquired a great name in painting at his leisure hours he etched a few prints from his own designs which are highly finished and executed with great softness and delicacy the salutation is his capital performance of which we seldom meet with any impressions but those taken from the retouched plate which are very harsh  anthony tempesta was a native of florence but resided chiefly at rome where he was much employed as a painter by gregory xiii  his prints are very numerous all from his own designs battles and huntings are the subjects in which he most delighted his merit lies in expression and drawing in the grandeur of his ideas and an imagination exceedingly fertile his figures are often elegant and graceful and his heads marked with uncommon spirit and correctness his horses though fleshy and illdrawn and evidently never copied from nature are however noble animals and display an endless variety of beautiful actions  his imperfections at the same time are very glaring his composition is generally bad here and there you have a good group seldom an agreeable whole he had not the art of preserving his backgrounds tender so that we are not to expect any effect of keeping his execution is harsh and he is totally ignorant of the distribution of light  but notwithstanding all his faults such is his merit upon the whole that as studies at least his prints deserve a much higher rank in the cabinets of connoisseurs than they generally find  augustine carrache has left a few etchings which are admired for the delicacy of the drawing and the freedom of the execution but there is great flatness in them and want of strength etchings indeed in this style are rather meant as scetches than finished prints  guidos etchings most of which are small are esteemed for the simplicity of the design the elegance and correctness of the outline and that grace for which this master is so remarkable the extremities of his figures are particularly touched with great accuracy but we have the same spiritless flatness in the works of guido which we find in those of his master carrache accompanied at the same time with less freedom  cantarini copied the manner of guido as paria did that of palma and so happily that it is often difficult to distinguish the works of these two masters  callot was little acquainted with any of the grand principles of painting of composition and the management of light he was totally ignorant but though he could not make a picture he was admirably skilled in drawing a figure his attitudes are generally graceful when they are not affected his expression strong his drawing correct and his execution masterly though rather labored his fair is a good epitome of his works considered as a whole it is a confused jumble of ideas but the parts separately examined appear the work of a master the same character may be given of his most famous work the miseries of war in which there is more expression both in action and feature than was ever perhaps shown in so small a compass and yet i know not whether his beggars be not the more capital performance in the miseries of war he aims at composition in which he rarely succeeds his beggars are detached figures in which lay his strength  i shall only add that a vein of drollery and humor runs through all his designs which sometimes when he chooses to indulge it freely as in the temptation of st anthony displays itself in a very facetious manner  count gaude contracted a friendship at rome with adam elshamer from whose designs he engraved a few prints gaude was a young nobleman upon his travels and never practiced engraving as a profession this would call for indulgence if his prints had less merit but in their way they are beautiful though on the whole formal and unpleasant they are highly finished but void of all freedom moonlights and torchlights are the subjects he chiefly chooses and his great excellence lies in preserving the effects of these different lights his prints are generally small i know only one the flight into egypt of a larger size  salvator rosa painted landscape more than history but his prints are chiefly historical he was bred a painter and perfectly understood his art if we except only the management of light of which he seems to have been ignorant the capital landscape of this master at chiswick is a noble picture the contrivance the composition the distances the figures and all the parts and appendages of it are fine but in point of light it might perhaps have been improved if the middle ground where the figures of the second distance stand had been thrown into sunshine  in design and generally in composition salvator is very great his figures which he drew in exquisite taste are graceful and nobly expressive beautifully grouped and varied into the most agreeable attitudes with regard indeed to the legs of his figures it must be owned he is a mannerist they are well drawn but all cast in one mould there is a stiffness too in the backs of his extended hands the palms are beautiful but these are trivial criticisms  his manner is flight so as not to admit either softness or effect yet the simplicity and elegance of it are wonderfully pleasing and bear that strong characteristic of a masters hand  sibi quivis speret idem    one thing in his manner of shading is disagreable he will often shade a face half over with long lines which in so small and delicate an object gives an unpleasant abruptness it is treating a face like an egg no distinction of feature is observed  salvator was a man of genius and of learning both which he has found frequent opportunities of displaying in his works his style is grand every object that he introduces is of the heroic kind and his subjects in general show an intimacy with ancient history and mythology  a roving disposition to which he is said to have given full scope seems to have added a wildness to all his thoughts we are told he spent the early part of his life in a troop of banditti and that the rocky and desolate scenes in which he was accustomed to take refuge furnished him with those romantic ideas in landscape of which he is so exceedingly fond and in the description of which he so greatly excells his robbers as his detached figures are commonly called are supposed also to have been taken from the life  rembrandts excellency as a painter lay in coloring which he possessed in such perfection that it almost screens every fault in his pictures his prints deprived of this palliative have only his inferior qualifications to recommend them these are expression and skill in the management of light execution and sometimes composition i mention them in the order in which he seems to have possessed them his expression has most force in the character of age he marks as strongly as the hand of time itself he possesses too in a great degree that inferior kind of expression which gives its proper and characteristic touch to drapery fur metal and every object he represents  his management of light consists chiefly in making a very strong contrast which has often a good effect and yet in many of his prints there is no effect at all which gives us reason to think he either had no principles or published such prints before his principles were ascertained  his execution is peculiar to himself it is rough or neat as he meant a scetch or a finished piece but always free and masterly it produces it is effect by strokes intersected in every direction and comes nearer the idea of painting than the execution of any other master  never painter was more at a loss than rembrandt for an idea of that species of grace which is necessary to support an elevated character while he keeps within the sphere of his genius and contents himself with low subjects he deserves any praise but when he attempts beauty or dignity it were goodnatured to suppose he means only burlesque and charicature he is a strong contrast to salvator the one drew all his ideas from nature as she appears with the utmost grace and elegance the other caught her in her meanest images and transferred those images into the highest characters hence salvator exalts banditti into heroes rembrandt degrades patriarchs into beggars rembrandt indeed seems to have affected awkwardness he was a man of humor and would laugh at those artists who studied the antique i will show you my antiques he would cry and then he would carry his friends into a room furnished with headdresses draperies household stuff and instruments of all kinds these he would add are worth all your antiques  his best etching is that which goes by the name of the hundredguildresprint which is in such esteem that i have known twenty guineas given for a good impression of it in this all his excellencies are united and i might add his imperfections also age and wretchedness are admirably described but the principal figure is ridiculously mean  rembrandt is said to have left behind him near three hundred prints none of which are dated before mdcxxviii none after mdclix they were in such esteem even in his own lifetime that he is said to have retouched some of them four or five times  peter testa studied upon a plan very different from that either of salvator or rembrandt those masters drew their ideas from nature testa from what he esteemed a superior model  the antique smit with the love of painting this artist traveled to rome in the habit of a pilgrim destitute of all the means of improvement but what mere genius furnished he had not even interest to procure a recommendation nor had he any address to substitute in it is room the works of sculpture fell most obviously in his way and to those he applied himself with so much industry copying them over and again that he is said to have gotten them all by heart thus qualified he took up the pencil but he soon found the school in which he had studied a very insufficient one to form a painter he had neglected coloring and his pictures were in no esteem disappointed and mortified he threw aside his pallet and applied himself to etching in which he became a great proficient  his prints are very valuable we are seldom indeed to expect a coherency of design in any of them an enthusiastic vein runs through most of his compositions and it is not an improbable conjecture that his head was a little disturbed he generally crowds into his pieces such a jumble of inconsistent ideas that it is difficult sometimes only to guess at what he aims he was as little acquainted with the distribution of light as with the rules of design and yet notwithstanding all this his works contain an infinite fund of entertainment there is an exuberance of fancy in him which with all its wildness is agreeable his ideas are sublime and noble his drawing most elegantly correct his heads touched with infinite spirit and expression his figures graceful rather too nearly allied to the antique his groups often beautiful and his execution in his best etchings for he is often unequal to himself very masterly some of his works are etched by caes testa perhaps no prints afford more useful studies for a painter  the procession of silenus if we may guess at so confused a design may illustrate all that has been said the whole is as incoherent as the parts are beautiful  this unfortunate artist was drowned in the tyber and it is left uncertain whether by accident or design  spaniolet etched a few prints in a very spirited manner no master understood better the force of every touch silenus and bacchus and the martyrdom of st bartholomew are the best of his historical prints and yet these are inferior to some of his charicaturas which are admirably executed  michael dorigny or old dorigny as he is often called to distinguish him from nicholas had the misfortune to be the son in law of simon vouet whose works he engraved and whose imperfections he copied his execution is free and he preserves the lights extremely well upon single figures his drapery too is natural and easy but his drawing is below criticism in the extremities especially in this his master misled him vouet excelled in composition of which we have many beautiful instances in dorignys prints  villamena was inferior to few engravers if he be deficient in strength and effect there is a delicacy in his manner which is inimitable one of his best prints is a descent from the cross  but his works are so rare that we can scarce form an adequate idea of his merit  stephen de la bella was a minute genius his manner wants strength for any larger work but in small objects it appears to advantage there is great freedom in it and uncommon neatness his figures are touched with spirit and sometimes his composition is good but he seldom discovers any skill in the management of light though the defect is less striking because of the smallness of the pieces his pont neuf will give us an idea of his works through the bad management of the light it makes no appearance as a whole though the composition if we except the modern architecture is tolerable but the figures are marked with great beauty and the distances extremely fine  some of his single heads are very elegant    la fages works consist chiefly of scetches the great excellency of this master lay in drawing in which he was perfectly skilled however unfinished his pieces are they discover him to have been admirably acquainted with anatomy and proportion there is very little in him besides that is valuable grace and expression sometimes seldom composition his figures are generally either too much crowded or too diffuse as for light and shade he seems to have been totally ignorant of their effect or he could never have shown so bad a taste as to publish his designs without at least a bare expression of the masses of each indeed we have positive proof as well as negative where he has attempted an effect of light he has shown only how little he knew of it  his genius chiefly displays itself in the gambols of nymphs and satyrs in routs and revels but there is so much obscenity in his works of this kind that although otherwise fine they scarce afford an innocent entertainment  in some of his prints in which he has attempted the sublimest characters he has given them a wonderful dignity some of his figures of christ are not inferior to the ideas of raphael and in a slight scetch entitled vocation de moyse the deity is introduced with surprising majesty  his best works are slightly etched from his drawings by ertinger who has done justice to them  bolswert engraved the works of rubens and in a style worthy of his master you see the same free and animated manner in both it is said that rubens touched his proofs and it is probable the ideas of the painter are so exactly transfused into the works of the engraver  pontius too engraved the works of rubens and would have appeared a greater master if he had not had such a competitor as bolswert  sciaminossi etched a few small plates of the mysteries of the rosary in a masterly style there is no great beauty in the composition but the drawing is good the figures are generally graceful and the heads touched with great spirit  roman le hooghe is inimitable in execution perhaps no master etches in a freer and more spirited manner there is a richness in it likewise which we seldom meet with his figures too are often good but his composition is generally faulty it is crowded and confused he knows little of the effect of light there is a flutter in him too which hurts an eye pleased with simplicity his prints are very historical the deluge at coeverden is finely described  le hooghe was much employed by the authors of his time in composing frontispieces some of which are very beautiful  luiken etches in the manner of le hooghe but it is a less masterly manner his history of the bible is a great work in which there are many good figures and great freedom of execution but poor composition much confusion and little skill in the distribution of light this master has also etched a book of various kinds of capital punishments amongst which there are many good prints  gerrard lairesse etches in a loose and unfinished but free and masterly manner his light is often well distributed but his shades have not sufficient strength to give his pieces effect though he was a dutch painter you see nothing of the dutchman in his works his composition is generally grand and beautiful especially where he has only a few figures to manage his figures themselves are graceful and his expression strong the simple and sublime ideas which appear every where in his works acquired him the title of the dutch raphael a title which he very well deserves lairesse may be called an ethic painter he commonly inculcates some truth either in morals or religion which he illustrates by a latin sentence at the bottom of his print  it may be added that his draperies are particularly excellent  castiglione was an italian painter of some eminence he drew human figures with grace and correctness yet he generally chose such subjects as would admit the introduction of animal life which often makes the most distinguished part of his piece  there is a simplicity in the designs of this master which is very beautiful in composition he excells greatly of his elegant groups we have many instances in a set of prints etched from his paintings in a slight free manner by c macee particularly in those of the patriarchal journeyings he has left us several of his own etchings also which are very valuable the subjects indeed of some of them are odd and fantastic and the composition not equal to some prints we have from his paintings by other hands but the execution is greatly superior freedom strength and spirit are very eminent in them and delicacy likewise where he chooses to finish highly of which we have some instances  one of his best prints is the entrance of noah into the ark the composition the distribution of light the spirit and expression with which the animals are touched and the freedom of the execution are all admirable  vander muilen has given us historical representations of several modern battles his prints are generally large and contain many good figures and agreeable groups but they have no effect and seldom produce a whole a disagreable monotony as the musical people speak runs through them all  otho venius has entirely the air of an italian though of dutch parentage he had the honor of being the master of the celebrated rubens who chiefly learned from him his knowledge of light and shade this artist published a book of loveemblems in which the cupids are engraved with great spirit his pieces of fabulous history have less merit  mellan was a whimsical engraver he shadowed entirely with parallel lines which he winds round the muscles of his figures and the folds of his draperies with great variety and beauty his manner is soft and delicate but void of strength and effect his compositions of course make no whole though his single figures are often elegant his saints and statues are in general his best pieces there is great expression in many of the former and his drapery is often incomparable one of his best prints is inscribed per se surgens and another very good one with this strange passage from st austin ego evangelio non crederem nisi me catholicae ecclesiae commoveret auctoritas  his head of christ effected by a single spiral line is a masterly but whimsical performance  ostades etchings like his pictures are admirable representations of low life they abound in humor and expression in which lies their great merit they have little besides to recommend them the composition is generally very indifferent and the execution no way remarkable sometimes and but seldom you see a good effect of light  cornelius bega etches very much in the manner of ostade but with more freedom  van tulden has nothing of the dutch master in his design which seems formed upon the study of the antique it is chaste elegant and correct his manner is rather firm and distinct than free and spirited his principal work is the voyage of ulysses in fiftyeight plates in which we have a great variety of elegant attitudes excellent characters of heads good drawing and though not much effect yet often good grouping his drapery is heavy  joseph parrocelle painted battles for lewis xiv he etched also several of his own designs the best of his works are eight small battles which are very scarce four of these are of a size larger than the rest of which two the battle and stripping the slain are very fine of the four smaller that entitled vesper is the best  his manner is rough free and masterly and his knowledge of the effect of light considerable  his greatest undertaking was the life of christ in a series of plates but it is a hasty and incorrect work most of the prints are mere scetches and many of them even in that light are bad though the freedom of the manner is pleasing in the worst of them the best plates are the   th   th   th   d   th   th   st   d and   d  v le febre etched many designs from titian and julio romano in a very miserable manner his drawing is bad his drapery frittered his lights illpreserved and his execution disgusting and yet we find his works in capital collections  bellanges prints are highly finished and his execution is not amiss his figures also have something in them which looks like grace and his light is tolerably well massed but his heads are illset on his extremities incorrectly touched his figures badly proportioned and in short his drawing in general very bad  claude gillot was a french painter but finding himself rivalled he laid aside his pencil and employed himself entirely in etching his common subjects are dances and revels in which he introduces satyrs nymphs and fawns by giving his sylvans a peculiar cast of eye he has introduced a new kind of character the invention and fancy of this master are very pleasing and his composition is often good his manner is slight which is the best apology for his bad drawing  watteau has great defects and it must be owned great merit he abounds in all that flutter and affectation which is so disagreable in the generality of french painters but at the same time we acknowledge he draws well gives grace and delicacy to his figures and produces often a beautiful effect of light i speak chiefly of such of his works as have been engraved by others  he etched a few slight plates himself with great freedom and elegance the best of them are contained in a small book of figures in various dresses and attitudes  cornelius schut excells chiefly in execution sometimes in composition but he knows nothing of grace and has upon the whole but little merit  william baur etches with great spirit his largest works are in the historical way he has given us many of the sieges and battles which wasted flanders in the sixteenth century they may be exact and probably they are but they are rather plans than pictures and have little to recommend them but historic truth and the freedom of the execution baurs best prints are some characters he has given us of different nations in which the peculiarities of each are very well preserved his ovid is a poor performance  coypel has left us a few prints of his own etching the principal of which is an ecce homo touched with great spirit several of his own designs he etched himself and afterward put into the hands of engravers to finish it is probable he overlooked this work but it is probable also that we should have had better prints if we had received them pure from his own needle what they had lost in force would have been amply made up in spirit  picart was one of the most ingenious of the french engravers his imitations are among the most entertaining of his works the cry in his day ran wholly in favor of antiquity no modern masters were worth looking at picart piqued at such prejudice etched several pieces in imitation of ancient masters and so happily that he almost outdid in their own excellencies the artists whom he copied these prints were much admired as the works of guido rembrandt and others having had his joke he published them under the title of impostures innocents  picarts own manner is highly finished yet at the same time rich bold and spirited his prints are generally small and most of them from the designs of others one of the best is from that beautiful composition of poussin in which truth is delivered by time from envy  arthur pond our countryman succeeded admirably in this method of imitation in which he has etched several very valuable prints particularly two oval landskips after salvator  a monkey in red chalk after carrache  two or three ruins after panini and some others equally excellent  but this method of imitation has been most successfully practiced by count caylus an ingenious french nobleman whose works in this way are very voluminous he has ransacked the french kings cabinet and has scarce left a master of any note from whose drawings he has not given us excellent prints insomuch that if we had nothing remaining from those masters but count cayluss works we should not want a very sufficient idea of them so versatile is his genius that comte de caylus with the same ease he presents us with an elegant outline from raphael a rough scetch from rembrandt and a delicate portrait from vandyke  le clerc was an excellent engraver but chiefly in the petite style he immortalized alexander and lewis xiv in miniature his genius seldom exceeds the dimensions of six inches within those limits he can draw up twenty thousand men with great dexterity no artist except callot and della bella could touch a small figure with so much spirit he seems to have imitated callots manner but his stroke is neither so firm nor so masterly  peter bartoli etched with freedom though his manner is not agreeable his capital work is lanfranks gallery  jac freii is an admirable engraver he unites in a great degree strength and softness and comes as near the force of painting as an engraver can well do he employed himself chiefly in copying and has given us the strongest ideas of the works of several of the most eminent masters he preserves the drawing and expression of his original and often perhaps improves the effect you see him in perfection in a noble print from maratte entitled in conspectu angelorum psallam tibi  s gribelin is a careful and laborious engraver of no extensive genius but painfully exact his works are chiefly small the principal of which are his copies from the banqueting house at whitehall and from the cartoons his manner is formal yet he has contrived to preserve the spirit of his original we have no copies of the cartoons so good as his it is a pity he did not engrave them on a larger scale  le bas etches in a clear distinct free manner and has done great honor to the works of teniers woverman and berghem from whom he chiefly copied the best of his works are after berghem  bischops etching has something very pleasing in it it is loose and free and yet has strength and richness many of his statues are good figures the drawing is sometimes incorrect but the execution beautiful many of the plates of his drawingbook are very well his greatest single work is the representation of joseph in egypt in which there are many faults both in the drawing and effect some of which are chargeable upon him and others upon the artist from whom he copied but upon the whole it is a pleasing print  francis perrier was the debauched son of a goldsmith in franchecompte his indiscretions forcing him from home his inclinations led him to rome his manner of traveling thither was whimsical he joined himself to a blind beggar whom he agreed to lead for half his alms at rome he applied to painting and made a much greater proficiency than could have been expected from his dissipated life he published a large collection of statues and other antiquities which are etched in a very masterly manner the drawing is often incorrect but the attitudes are well chosen and the execution spirited many of them seem to have been done hastily but there are marks of genius in them all  marot who was architect to k william has etched some statues likewise in a very masterly manner indeed all his works are admirably executed but they consist chiefly of ornaments in the way of his profession  fran roettiers etches in a very bold manner and with a good deal of spirit but there is a harshness in his outline which is disagreable though the less so as his drawing is generally good few artists manage a crowd better or give it more effect by a proper distribution of light of this management we have some judicious instances in his two capital prints the assumption of the cross and the crucifixion  nicholas dorigny was bred a lawyer but not succeeding at the bar he studied painting and afterward applied to engraving his capital work is the transfiguration which mr addison calls the noblest print in the world it is unquestionably a noble work but dorigny seems to have exhausted his genius upon it for he did nothing afterward worth preserving his cartoons are very poor he engraved them in his old age and was obliged to employ assistants who did not answer his expectation  masters in portrait among the masters in portrait rembrandt may take the lead his heads are admirable copies from nature and perhaps the best of his works there is infinite expression in them and character  van uliet followed rembrandts manner which he has in many things excelled some of his heads nothing can exceed the force which he gives to every feature the roundness of the muscle the spirit of the execution the strength of the character and the effect of the whole are all admirable    j lievens etches in the same style his heads are executed with great spirit and deserve a place in any collection of prints though they are certainly inferior to uliets  uliet and lievens etched some historical prints particularly the latter whose lazarus after rembrandt is a noble work but their portraits are their best prints  among the imitators of rembrandt we should not forget our countryman worlidge who has very ingeniously followed the manner of that master and sometimes improved upon him no man understood the drawing of an head better  many of van dykes etchings do him great credit they are chiefly to be found in a collection of the portraits of eminent artists which van dyke was at the expense of getting engraved several of these he etched himself they are done slightly but bear the character of a master luke vosterman is one of the best it is probable van dyke made the drawings for most of the rest his manner is conspicuous in them all  a very finished etching of an ecce homo passes under the name of this master it is a good print upon the whole but not equal to what we might expect  we have a few prints of sir peter peter lelys etching likewise but there is nothing in them that is extraordinary  r white was the principal engraver of portraits in charles iids reign but his works are miserable performances they are said to be good likenesses they may be so but they are wretched prints  becket and simons are names which scarce deserve to be mentioned they were both metzotintoscrapers of note only because they were the best of their time  white the metzotinto scraper son of the engraver was an artist of great merit he copied after sir godfrey kneller whom he teized so much with his proofs that it is said sir godfrey forbad him his house his metzotintos are very beautiful baptiste wing sturges and hooper are all admirable prints he himself used to say that old and young parr were the best portraits he ever scraped his manner was peculiar at the time he used it though it has since been adopted by other masters he first etched his plate and then scraped it hence his prints preserve a spirit to the last which few metzotintos do  smith was the pupil of becket but he soon excelled his master he was esteemed the best metzotintoscraper his royal highness george prince of denmark  eques pinx i smith ec sold by i smith at the lion and crown in russel street covent garden  portrait of prince george of his time though perhaps inferior to white he has left a very numerous collection of portraits so numerous that they are often bound in two large folios he copied chiefly from sir godfrey and is said to have had an apartment in his house  lord summers was so fond of the works of this master that he seldom traveled without carrying them with him in the seat of his coach  some of his best prints are two holy families anthony leigh mary magdeline scalken an halflength of lady elizabeth cromwell the duke of schomberg on horseback the countess of salisbury gibbon the statuary and a very fine hawking piece from wyke  after all it must be owned that the best of these metzotintos are inferior to what we have seen done by the masters of the present age  mellans portraits are the most indifferent of his works they want strength spirit and effect  piazzeta a venetian has lately published a set of heads in the style of mellan but in a much finer taste both as to the composition and the manner though like mellan he never crosses his stroke yet he has contrived to give his heads more force and spirit  j morins heads are engraved in a very peculiar manner they are pinx vanity i smith fec et ex stippled with a graver after the manner of metzotinto and have a good effect they have force and at the same time softness few portraits upon the whole are better guido bentivolius from vnadyke is one of the best  j lutmas heads are executed in the same way we are told with a chissel and mallet they are inferior to morins but are not without merit  edm marmion etched a few portraits in the manner of vandyke and probably from him in which there is great ease and freedom he has put his name only to one of them  drevets portraits are neat and elegant but labored to the last degree they are copied from rigaud and other french masters and abound in all that flutter and licentious drapery so opposite to the simple and chaste ideas of true taste drevet chiefly excells in copying rigauds frippery lace silk fur velvet and other ornamental parts of dress  richardson has left us several heads which he etched for mr pope and others of his friends they are slight but show the spirit of a master mr popes profile is the best  virtue was an excellent antiquarian but no artist he copied with painful exactness in a dry disagreeable manner without force or freedom in his whole collection of heads we can scarce pick out half a dozen which are good  such an artist in metzotinto was faber he has published nothing extremely bad and yet few things worth collecting mrs collier is one of his best prints and a very good one she is leaning against a pillar on the base of which is engraved the story of the golden apple  houbraken is a genius and has given us in his collection of english portraits some pieces of engraving at least equal to any thing of the kind such are his heads of hambden schomberg the earl of bedford the duke of richmond particularly and some others at the same time we must own that he has intermixed among his works a great number of bad prints in his best there is a wonderful union of softness and freedom a more elegant and flowing line no artist surely ever employed  our countryman fry has left behind him a few very beautiful heads in metzotinto they are all copied from nature have great softness and spirit but want strength metzotinto is not adapted to works so large as the heads he has published    masters in animal life berghem has a genius truly pastoral and brings before us the most agreeable scenes of rural life the simplicity of arcadian manners is no where better described than in his works we have a large collection of prints from his designs many etched by himself and many by other masters those by himself are slight but masterly his execution is inimitable his cattle which are always the distinguishing part of his pieces are welldrawn admirably characterized and generally wellgrouped few painters excelled more in composition than berghem and yet we have more beautiful instances of it in the prints etched by others than in those by himself among his own etchings a few small plates of sheep and goats are exceedingly valued  j visscher never appears to more advantage than when he copies berghem his excellent drawing and the freedom of his execution give a great value to his prints which have more the air of originals than of copies he is a master both in etching and engraving his slightest etchings though copies only are the works of a master and when he touches with a graver he knows how to add strength and firmness without destroying freedom and spirit he might be said to have done every thing well if he had not failed in the distribution of light it is more than probable he has not attended to the effect of it in many of the paintings which he has copied  hondius a native of rotterdam passed the greater part of his life in england he painted animals chiefly was free in his manner extravagant in his coloring incorrect in his drawing ignorant of the effect of light but amazingly great in expression his prints therefore are better than his pictures they possess his chief excellency without his defects they are executed indeed with great spirit and afford such strong instances of animal fury as we meet with no where but in nature itself his hunted wolf is an admirable print  du jardin understood the anatomy of domestic animals perhaps better than any other master his drawing is admirably correct and yet the freedom of the master is preserved he copied nature strictly though not servilely and has given us not only the form but the characteristic peculiarities of each animal he never indeed like hondius animates his creation with the violence of savage fury his genius takes a milder turn all is quietness and repose his dogs after their exercise are stretched at their ease and the languor of a meridian sun prevails commonly through all his pieces his composition is beautiful and his execution though neat is spirited  his works when bound together make a volume of about  0 leaves among which there is scarce one bad print  reubenss huntings are undoubtedly superior upon the whole to any thing of the kind we have there is more invention in them and a grander style of composition than we find any where else i class them under his name because they are engraved by several masters but all their engravings are poor they resemble the paintings they are copied from as a shadow does the object which projects it there is something of the shape but all the finishing is lost and indeed there is no doubt but the awkwardnesses the patchwork and the grotesque characters which every where appear in those prints are in the originals bold foreshortnings grand effects of light and noble instances of expression  but it is as difficult to copy the flights of reubens as to translate those of homer the spirit of each master evaporates in the process  wovermans composition is generally crowded with little ornaments there is no simplicity in his works he wanted a chaste judgment to correct his exuberance  visscher was the first who engraved prints from this artist he chose only a few good designs and executed them masterly  moyreau undertook him next and has published a large collection he has finished them highly but with more softness than spirit his prints however have a neat appearance and exhibit a variety of pleasing representations cavalcades marches huntings and encampments  rosa of tivoli etched in a very finished manner no one outdid him in composition and execution he is very skilful too in the management of light his designs are all pastoral and yet there is often a mixture of the heroic style in his composition which is very pleasing his prints are scarce and were they not so would be valuable  stephen de la bella may be mentioned among the masters in animal life though few of his works in this way deserve any other praise than what arises from the elegance of the execution in general his animals are neither well drawn nor justly characterized the best of his works in animal life are some heads of camels and dromedaries  anthony tempesta has etched several plates of single horses and of huntings he has given great expression to his animals but his composition is more than ordinarily bad in these prints nor is there in any of them the least effect of light  j fyt has etched a few animals in which you discover the drawing and something of that inimitable strength and spirit with which this master painted but he has only done a few detached things in this way nothing to show his skill in composition and the management of light both which he well understood  in curious collections we meet with a few of cuyps etchings the pictures of this master excel in coloring composition drawing and the expression of character his prints have all these excellencies except the first  peter de laer has left us several small etchings of horses and other animals well characterized and executed in a bold and masterly manner many of them are single figures but when he composes his composition is generally good and his distribution of light seldom much amiss often very pleasing his drawing too is commonly good  peter stoop came from lisbon with queen catherine and was admired in england till wycks superior excellence in painting eclipsed him he has etched a book of horses which are very much valued as there is in general accuracy in the drawing nature in the characters and spirit in the execution  rembrandts lions which are etched in his usual style are worthy the notice of a connoisseur  blotelings lions are highly finished but with more neatness than spirit  paul potter etched several plates of cows and horses in a masterly manner his manner indeed is better than his drawing which in his sheep especially is but very indifferent neither does he characterize them with any accuracy  barlows etchings are numerous his illustration of esop is his greatest work there is something pleasing in the composition and manner of this master though neither is excellent his drawing too is very indifferent nor does he characterize any animal justly his birds in general are better than his beasts  flamen has etched several plates of birds and fishes the former are bad the latter better than any thing of the kind we have  hollar has given us several plates in animal life which ought the rather to be taken notice of as they are the best of his works two or three small plates of domestic fowls ducks woodcocks and other game are very well his shells and butterflies are beautiful and indeed these are the subjects suited to his genius and it is a pity he did not confine himself to them  i shall close this account with ridinger who is one of the greatest masters in animal life he is still living but as he is so capital in this way he must not be omitted this artist has marked the characters of animals especially of the more savage kind with surprising expression his works may be considered as natural history he carries us into the forest among bears and tigers and with the exactness of a naturalist describes their forms haunts and manner of living  his composition is generally beautiful and his distribution of light good so that he commonly produces an agreeable whole his landscape too is picturesque and romantic and well adapted to the subjects he treats  on the other hand his manner is labored and wants freedom his human figures are seldom drawn with taste his horses are illcharacterized and worse drawn and indeed his drawing in general is but slovenly  the prints of this master are often real history and represent the portraits of particular animals which had been taken in hunting we have sometimes too the story of the chase in high dutch at the bottom of the print the idea of historical truth adds a relish to the entertainment and we survey the animal with new pleasure which has given diversion to a german prince for nine hours together  the productions of ridinger are very numerous and the greater part of them good his huntings in general and different methods of catching animals are the least picturesque of any of his works but he meant them rather as didactic prints than as pictures many of his fables are beautiful particularly the  d the  th the  th and the  0th i cannot forbear adding a particular encomium upon a book of the heads of wolves and foxes  his most capital prints are two large uprights one representing bears devouring a deer the other wildboars reposing in a forest  masters in landscape sadlers landskips have some merit in composition they are picturesque and romantic but the manner is dry and disagreeable the light is illdistributed the distances illkept and the figures bad  there were three engravers of this name but none of them eminent john engraved a set of prints for the bible and many other small plates in the historical way in which we sometimes find a graceful figure and tolerable drawing but on the whole no great merit egidius was the engraver of landskips and is the person here criticized ralph chiefly copied the designs of bassan and engraved in the dry disagreeable manner of his brother  rembrandts landskips have very little to recommend them besides their effect which is often surprising one of the most admired of them goes under the name of the three trees  gasper poussin etched a few landskips in a very loose but masterly manner it is a pity we have not more of his works  abraham bloemart understood the beauty of composition as well in landscape as in history his prints have little force through the want of a proper distribution of light neither is there much freedom in the execution but there is generally great elegance in the design and great simplicity  hollar gives us views of particular places which he copies with great truth unornamented as he found them if we are satisfied with exact representations we have them no where better than in hollars works but if we expect pictures we must seek them elsewhere hollar was an antiquarian and a draughtsman but seems to have been unacquainted with any one principle of painting stiffness to the last degree is his characteristic and a painful exactness utterly void of all taste his larger views are mere plans in some of his smaller at the expense of infinite pains something of an effect is sometimes produced but in general we consider him as a repository of curiosities a record of antiquated dresses abolished ceremonies and edifices now in ruins  stephen de la bellas landskips have little to recommend them besides their neatness and keeping there is no great beauty in his composition and the foliage of his trees resembles bits of sponge i speak chiefly of his larger works for which his manner is not calculated his great neatness qualifies him better for miniature  bolswerts landskips after reubens are composed in a very grand style such a painter and such an engraver could not fail of producing something great there is little variety in them nor any of the more minute beauties arising from contrasts catching lights and such little elegancies but every thing is simple and great the print which goes by the name of the wagon is particularly and deservedly admired of these prints you generally meet with good impressions as the plates are engraved with great strength  neulant has etched a small book of the ruins of rome in which there is great simplicity and some skill in composition and the distribution of light but the execution is harsh and disagreeable  we have a few landskips by an earl of sunderland in an elegant loose manner one of them in which is is a spaniard standing on the foreground is marked g and j sculpserunt another j g  waterlo is a name beyond any other in landscape his subjects are perfectly rural simplicity is their characteristic we find no great variety in them nor stretch of fancy he selects a few striking objects a coppice a corner of a forest a windingroad or a straggling village is generally the extent of his view nor does he always introduce an offskip his composition is generally good and his light often well distributed but his chief merit lies in execution in which he is a consummate master every object that he touches has the character of nature but he particularly excells in the foliage of trees  it is a difficult matter to meet with the works of this master in perfection the original plates are all retouched and greatly injured  swanevelt painted landscape at rome where he obtained the name of the hermit from his solitary walks among the ruins of tivoli and frescati he etched in the manner of waterlo but with less freedom his trees in particular will bear no comparison with those of that master and yet upon the whole his works have great merit we should think them excellent if the idea of waterlos superiority in the same style of etching did not constantly recur  james rousseau was the disciple of swanevelt he was a french protestant and fled into england from the persecution of lewis xiv here he was patronized by the duke of montague whose palace now the british museum he contributed to adorn with his paintings some of which are very good the few etchings he has left are very beautiful he understood composition and the distribution of light and there is a fine taste in his landskips if we except perhaps only that his horizon is often taken too high neither can his perspective at all times bear a critical examination and what is worse it is often pedantically introduced his figures are good in themselves and generally well placed  his manner is rather dry and formal  rousseau it may be added was an excellent man having escaped the rage of persecution himself he made it his study to lessen the sufferings of his distressed brethren by distributing among them the greatest part of his gains such an anecdote in the life of a painter should not be omitted even in so short a review as this  j lutma has etched a few small landskips in a masterly manner which discover some skill in composition and the management of light  israel sylvestre has given us small views some indeed of a larger size of most of the capital ruins churches bridges and castles in italy and france they are exceedingly neat and touched with great spirit this master can give beauty even to the outlines of a modern building and what is more he gives it without injuring the truth insomuch that i have seen a gentleman just come from his travels pick out many of sylvestres views one by one though he had never seen them before merely from his acquaintance with the buildings to his praise it may be farther added that in general he forms his view into an agreeable whole and if his light is not always well distributed there are so many beauties in his execution that the eye cannot find fault his works are very numerous and few of them are bad in trees he excels least  the etchings of claude lorrain are below his character we sometimes find good composition in them but little else his execution is bad there is a dirtiness in it which is disgusting his trees are heavy his lights seldom wellmassed and his distances only sometimes observed  the truth is claudes talents lay upon his pallet and he could do nothing without it  perelle has great merit his fancy is exceedingly fruitful and supplies him with a richness and variety in his views which nature seldom exhibits it is indeed too exuberant for he often confounds the eye with too great a luxuriancy his manner is his own and it is hard to say whether it excells most in richness strength elegance or freedom his trees are particularly beautiful the foliage is loose and the ramification easy and graceful and yet it must be confessed that perelle is rather a mannerist than a copier of nature his views are all ideal his trees are of one family and his light though generally well distributed is sometimes affected it is introduced as a spot and is not properly melted into the neighboring shade by a middle tint catching lights used sparingly are beautiful perelle affects them  these remarks are made principally upon the works of old perelle as he is called there were three engravers of this name the grandfather the father and the son they all engraved in the same style but the juniors instead of improving the the familytaste degenerated the grandfather is the best and the grandson the worst  overbeck etched a book of roman ruins which are in general good they are pretty large and highly finished his manner is free his light often well distributed and his composition agreeable  genoels landskips are rather free scetches than finished prints in that light they are beautiful no effect is aimed at but the free manner in which they are touched is pleasing and the composition is in general good though often crowded  boths taste in landscape is elegant his ideas are grand his composition beautiful and his execution bold and masterly his light too is commonly well distributed and his figures are excellent we regret only that we have so few of his works  marco riccis works which are numerous have little merit his human figures indeed are good and his trees tolerable but he produces no effect his manner is disgusting his cattle illdrawn and his distances illpreserved  zeeman was a dutch painter and excelled in seacoasts beaches and distant land which he commonly ornamented with skiffs and fishingboats his execution is neat and his distances well kept of the distribution of light he knows nothing and the foregrounds of many of his prints are for that reason particularly bad but his figures are good and his skiffs admirable in his seapieces he introduces larger vessels but his prints in this style are commonly awkward and disagreeable  vandiest left behind him a few rough scetches which are executed with great freedom  goupy very happily caught the manner of salvator and in some things excelled him there is a richness in his execution and a spirit in his trees which salvator wants but his figures are bad very gross instances not only of indelicacy of outline but even of bad drawing may be found in his print of porsenna and in that of diana landscape is his sort and his best prints are those which go under the titles of the latrones the augurs tobit hagar and its companion  our celebrated countryman hogarth cannot properly be omitted in a catalogue of engravers and yet he ranks in none of the foregoing classes with this apology i shall introduce him here  the works of this master abound in true humor and satyr which is generally welldirected they are admirable moral lessons and a fund of entertainment suited to every taste a circumstance which shows them to be just copies of nature we may consider them too as valuable repositories of the manners customs and dresses of the present age what a fund of entertainment would a collection of this kind afford drawn from every period of the history of britain  how far the works of hogarth will bear a critical examination may be the subject of a little more enquiry  in design hogarth was seldom at a loss his invention was fertile and his judgment accurate an improper incident is rarely introduced a proper one rarely omitted no one could tell a story better or make it in all its circumstances more intelligible his genius however it must be owned was suited only to low or familiar subjects it never soared above common life to subjects naturally sublime or which from antiquity or other accidents borrowed dignity he could not rise  in composition we see little in him to admire in many of his prints the deficiency is so great as plainly to show a want of all principles it makes us ready to believe that when we do meet with a beautiful group it is the effect of chance in one of his minor works the idle prentice we seldom see a crowd more beautifully managed than in the last print if the sheriffs officers had not been placed in a line and had been brought a little lower in the picture so as to have formed a pyramid with the cart the composition had been unexceptionable and yet the first print of this work is such a striking instance of disagreeable composition that it is amazing how an artist who had any idea of beautiful forms could suffer so unmasterly a performance to leave his hands  of the distribution of light hogarth had as little knowledge as of composition in some of his pieces we see a good effect as in the execution just mentioned in which if the figures at the right and left corners had been kept down a little the light would have been beautifully distributed on the foreground and a fine secondary light spread over part of the crowd but at the same time there is so obvious a deficiency in point of effect in most of his prints that it is very evident he had no principles  neither was hogarth a master in drawing of the muscles and anatomy of the head and hands he had perfect knowledge but his trunks are often badly molded and his limbs ill set on i tax him with plain bad drawing i speak not of the niceties of anatomy and elegance of outline of these indeed he knew nothing nor were they of use in that mode of design which he cultivated and yet his figures upon the whole are inspired with so much life and meaning that the eye is kept in good humor in spite of its inclination to find fault  the author of the analysis of beauty it might be supposed would have given us more instances of grace than we find in the works of hogarth which shows strongly that theory and practice are not always united many opportunities his subjects naturally afford of introducing graceful attitudes and yet we have very few examples of them with instances of picturesque grace his works abound  but of his expression in which the force of his genius lay we cannot speak in terms too high in every mode of it he was truly excellent the passions he thoroughly understood and all the effects which they produce in every part of the human frame he had the happy art also of conveying his ideas with the same precision with which he conceived them  he was excellent too in expressing any humourous oddity which we often see stamped upon the human face all his heads are cast in the very mould of nature hence that endless variety which is displayed through his works and hence it is that the difference arises between his heads and the affected charicaturas of those masters who have sometimes amused themselves with patching together an assemblage of features from their own ideas such are spaniolets which though admirably executed appear plainly to have no archetypes in nature hogarths on the other hand are collections of natural curiosities the oxfordheads the physiciansarms and some of his other pieces are expressly of this humourous kind they are truly comic though illnatured effusions of mirth more entertaining than spaniolets as they are pure nature but less innocent as they contain illdirected ridicule  but the species of expression in which this master perhaps most excels is that happy art of catching those peculiarities of air and gesture which the ridiculous part of every profession contract from their peculiar situation and which for that reason become characteristic of the whole his counselors his undertakers his lawyers his usurers are all conspicuous at sight in a word almost every profession may see in his works that particular species of affectation which they should most endeavor to avoid  the execution of this master is well suited to his subjects and manner of treating them he etches with great spirit and never gives one unnecessary stroke for myself i greatly more value the works of his own needle than those highfinished prints on which he employed other engravers for as the production of an effect is not his talent and as this is the chief excellence of highfinishing his own rough manner is certainly preferable in which we have most of the force and spirit of his expression the manner in none of his works pleases me so well as in a small print of a corner of a playhouse there is more spirit in a work of this kind struck off at once warm from the imagination than in all the cold correctness of an elaborate engraving if all his works had been executed in this style with a few improvements in the composition and the management of light they would certainly have been a much more valuable collection of prints than they are the rakes progress and some of his other works are both etched and engraved by himself they are well done but it is plain he meant them as furniture as works designed for a criticks eye they would certainly have been better without the engraving except a few touches in a very few places the want of effect too would have been less conspicuous which in his highest finished prints is disagreeably striking  chapter iv remarks on particular prints the resurrection of lazarus by bloemart with regard to design this print has great merit the point of time is very judiciously chosen it is a point between the first command lazarus come forth and the second loose him and let him go the first astonishment of the two sisters is now over the predominant passion is gratitude which is discovering itself in praise one of the attendents is telling the yet stupefied man that is your sister he himself collecting his scattered ideas directs his gratitude to christ jesus directs it farther to heaven so far the design is good but what are those idle figures on the right hand and on the left some of them seem no way concerned in the action two of the principal of them are introduced as gravediggers but even in that capacity they were unwanted for the place we are told was a cave and a stone rolled upon the mouth when a painter is employed on a barren subject he must make up his groups as he is able but there is no barrenness here and the painter might with propriety have introduced in the room of the gravediggers some of the pharisaical party maligning the action such we are told were on the spot they are figures of consequence in the story and ought not to have been shoved back as they are among the appendages of the piece  the composition is almost faultless the principal group is finely disposed it is form is nearly that of a rightangled triangle the hand of christ is the apex the kneeling figure and the dark figure looking up make the two other angles the group opens in a beautiful manner and discovers every part it is equally beautiful when considered as combined with the figures on the left it then forms an easy inclined plane of which the highest figure is the apex and the dark figure just mentioned on the left of lazarus is the angle at the base such combinations of triangular forms have a fine effect  the light is very illdistributed though the figures are disposed to receive the most beautiful effect of it the whole is one glare it had been better if all the figures on the elevated ground on the right had been in strong shadow the extended arm the head and shoulder of the gravedigger might have received catching lights a little more light might have been thrown upon the principal figure and a little less upon the figure kneeling the remaining figures on the left should have been kept down thus the light would have centered strongly upon the capital group and would have faded gradually away  the single figures are in general good the principal one indeed is not so capital as might be wished the character is not quite pleasing the right arm is aukwardly introduced if not illdrawn and the whole disagreably incumbered with drapery  lazarus is very fine the drawing the expression and grace of the figure are all good  the figure kneeling is not very graceful but it contrasts with the group  the gravediggers are both admirable figures it is a pity they should be encumbrances only  the drawing is good yet there seems to be something amiss in the pectoral muscles of the gravedigger on the right the hands too in general of all the figures are constrained and awkward few of them are in natural action  the manner is strong distinct and expressive it is mere engraving without any etching the drapery of the kneeling figure is particularly well touched as are also the head and leg of lazarus and the gravedigger on the left  the death of polycrates by salvator rosa the story is well told every part is fully engaged in the subject and properly subordinate to it  the disposition is agreeable the contrivance of the groups falling one into another is very pleasing and yet the form would have been more beautiful if a ladder with a figure upon it a piece of loose drapery a standard or some other object had been placed on the left side of the cross to have filled up that formal vacancy in the shape of a rightangle and to have made the pyramid more complete the groups themselves are simple and elegant the three figures on horseback indeed are had a line of heads is always unpleasing  we have no idea of keeping the whole has only one surface which might have been prevented by a little more strength on the foreground and a slighter sky  the light is distributed without any judgment it might perhaps have been improved if the group of the soldier resting upon his shield had been in shadow with a few catching lights this shadow passing through the label might have extended over great part of the foreground above it by which we should have had a body of shadow to balance the light of the centregroup the lower figures of the equestriangroup might have received a middle tint with a few strong touches the upper figures might have caught the light to detach them from the ground  with regard to the figures taken separately they are almost unexceptionably good you will seldom indeed see so many good figures in any collection of such a number the young soldier leaning over his shield the other figures of that group the soldier pointing in the middle of the picture and the figure behind him spreading his hands are all in the highest degree elegant and graceful the distant figures too are beautiful the expression in the whole body of the spectators is very striking some are more and some less affected but every one in a degree  all the figures however are not faultless polycrates hangs ungracefully upon his cross his body is too much made up of parallel lines and right angles his face is strongly marked with agony but his legs are disproportioned to his body  the three lower figures of the equestriangroup are bad they are properly placed to catch the abruptness of the centregroup and finish the pyramidal form but they might have had a little more meaning and a little more grace  one of the equestrian figures also that nearest the cross is formal and disgusting and as to an horse salvator seems not to have had the least idea of the proportion and anatomy of that animal  the scenery is inimitable the rock broken and covered with shrubs at the top and afterward spreading into one grand and simple shade is in itself a pleasing object and affords an excellent background to the figures  the execution of this print is equal to that of any of salvators works the passages in which this masters manner is more particularly characterized are the soldier sitting with the shield the pointing figure in the middle group the head in armor behind it the distant groups immediately on the right and left of the cross and the scenery in general  the triumph of silenus by peter testa p testa seems in this elegant and masterly performance as far as his sublime ideas can be comprehended to intend a satyr upon drunkenness  the design seems to be perfect the god is introduced in the middle of the piece holding an ivycrown and supported by his train in all the pomp of unwieldy majesty before him dance a band of bacchanalian rioters while intemperance debauchery and unnatural lusts complete the immoral festival in the offskip rises the temple of priapus hard by a mountain dedicated to lewdness nymphs and satyrs  in the heavens are represented the moon and stars pushing back the sun to show that the actions of which this night was a witness dreaded the approach of light  the disposition has less merit yet is not unpleasing the whole group on the left of silenus and the several parts of it are happily disposed the group of dancers on the other side is crowded and illshapen it is disagreeable too for want of contrast the two principal figures each standing on one leg appear disgusting counterparts the whole i speak only of the terrestrial groups is disposed in the form of an easy inclined plane which partakes as little as possible of the pyramidal form it might perhaps have had a better effect if an elegant canopy had been holden over silenus which would have been no improper appendage and by bringing the apex of the pyramid over the principal figure would have given more variety to the whole the sameness too in the disposition of the etherial and the terrestrial figures which is rather displeasing would have been prevented by this slight alteration  the light with regard to particular figures is very beautiful but such a light at best gives you only the idea of a picture examined by a candle every figure as you hold the candle to it appears well lighted but instead of an effect of light you have only a succession of spots indeed the light is not only ill but absurdly distributed the upper part is enlightened by one sun and the lower part by another the direction of the light being different in each  should we endeavor to amend it it might be better perhaps to leave out the sun and to represent him by his symbols as approaching only the skyfigures would of course receive catching lights and might be left nearly as they are the figure of rain under the moon should be in shadow the bear too and the lions head should be kept down thus there would be nothing glaring in the celestial figures for silenus and his train they might be enlightened by a very strong torchlight which might be carried by the dancing figures the light would then fall nearly as it does upon the principal group the other figures should be brought down to a middle tint this kind of light would naturally produce a gloom in the background but there is no occasion to make it dark as more torchlight might be supposed  with regard to the figures taken separately they are conceived with such classical purity and simplicity of taste so elegant in the drawing so graceful in every attitude and at the same time marked with such manly expression that if i were obliged to fix upon any print as an example of all the beauties of which single figures are capable of receiving i should be tempted to give the preference to this though at the same time it must be owned that some of them give you too much the idea of marble  the most striking instances of fine drawing are seen in the principal figure in the legs of the figure that supports him and in those of the figure dancing with the pipes in the man and woman behind the centaur in the figure in the clouds with his right hand over his knee in the apollo and particularly in that bold foreshortened figure of the sign capricorn  instances of expression we have in the unweildiness of silenus he appears so dead a weight so totally unelastic that every part of him which is not supported sinks with its own gravity the sensibility too with which his bloated body like a quagmire feels every touch is strongly expressed in his countenance the figure which supports him expresses in every muscle the labor of the action the dancing figures if we except that with the thyrsus are all strongly characterized the pushing figures in the sky are marked with great expression and above all the threatening capricorn who is represented in the act of drawing a bow  with regard to grace every figure at least every capital one is agreeable if we except only that figure which lies kicking its legs upon the ground but we have the strongest instances of grace in the figure dancing with the pipes in the man and woman behind the centaur which it is not improbable might be designed for bacchus and ariadne and in the boy lying on the ground  with regard to execution we rarely see an instance of it in greater perfection every head every muscle and every extremity is touched with infinite spirit the very appendages are fine and the stonepines which adorn the background are marked with such taste and precision as if landscape had been this artists only study  smiths portrait of the duke of shomberg from kneller kneller even when he laid himself out to excel was often but a tawdry painter his equestrian portrait of king william at hampton court is a very unmasterly performance the composition is bad the coloring gaudy the whole is void of effect and there is scarce a good figure in it  the composition before us is more pleasing though the effect is little better an equestrian figure at best is an awkward subject the legs of an horse are great encumbrances in grouping vandyke indeed has managed king charles the first on horseback with great judgment and rubens too at hampton court has made a noble picture of the duke of alva though his horse is very illdrawn  in the print before us the figure sits with grace and dignity but the horse is no bucephalus its character is only that of a managedpad the bush growing by the dukes trunchion is a trifling circumstance and helps to break into more parts a composition already too much broken  the execution is throughout excellent and though the parts are rather too small for metzotinto yet smith has given them all their force  pethers metzotinto of rembrandts jewish rabbi the character is that of a stern haughty man big with the idea of his own importance the rabbi is probably fictitious but the caracter was certainly taken from nature there is great dignity in it which in a work of rembrandts is the more extraordinary  the full expression of it is given us in the print the unelastic heaviness of age which is so well described in the original is as well preserved in the copy the three equidistant lights on the head on the ornament and on the hands are disagreeable in the print they could not be removed but it might have been judicious to have kept down the two latter a little more  with regard to the execution every part is scraped with the utmost softness and delicacy the muscles are round and plump and the insertions of them which in an old face are very apparent are well expressed such a variety of middle tints and melting lights were difficult to manage and yet they are managed with great tenderness the looseness of the beard is masterly the hands are exactly those of a fat old man the stern eyes are full of life and the nose and mouth are admirably touched the separation of the lips in some parts and adhesion in others are characteristic strokes and happily preserved the folds and lightness of the turban are very elegant the robe about the shoulder is unintelligible and illmanaged but this was the painters fault  in a word when we examine this very beautiful metzotinto we must acknowledge that no engraving can equal it in softness and delicacy  hondiuss hunted wolf the composition in this little print is good and yet there is too much similitude in the direction of the bodies of the several animals the shape also of the group would have been more pleasing if the vertical angle had been rather more acute the group is too much broken also and wants solidity the horizon is taken too high unless the dimensions of the print had been higher the risingground above the wolfs head had been offskip enough and yet the rock which rises higher is so beautifully touched that it would be a pity to remove it  the light is distributed without any judgment it might have been improved if all the interstices among the legs and heads of the animals had been kept down and the shadow made very strong under the fawn and the wounded dog this would have given a bold relief to the figures and might without any other alteration have produced a good effect  the drawing is not faultless the legs and body of the wounded dog are but very inaccurate nor does the attacking dog stand firm upon his right leg  with regard to expression hondius has exerted his full force the expression both of the wounded dog and of the wolf is admirable but the expression of the attacking dog is a most bold and masterly copy from nature his attitude shows every nerve convulsed and his head is a masterpiece of animal fury  we should add that the slaughtered animal is so illcharacterized that we scarce know what it is the execution is equal to the expression it is neat and highly finished but discovers in every touch the spirit of a master  the  th plate of du jardins animals the design though humble is simple and beautiful the two dogs reposing at noon after the labor of the morning the impliments of fowling the fictitious hedge and the loopholes through it all correspond together and agreeably tell the little history of the day  the composition is beautiful though it might have been improved if another dog or something equivalent had been introduced in the vacancy at the left corner this would have given the group of dogs a better form the nets and fowlingpieces are judiciously added and make an agreeable shape with the dogs the hedge also adds another pyramidal form which would have been more pleasing if the left corner of the reeds had been a little higher  the light is well distributed only there is too much of it the farther dog might have been taken down a little and the hinder parts of the nearer  the drawing and expression are pure nature and the execution elegant and masterly  waterlos tobias the landscape i mean is an upright of the largest size which this master ever used near twelve inches in height by ten on the near ground stands an oak which forms a diagonal through the print the second distance is composed of a rising ground connected with a rock which is covered with shrubs the oak and the shrubs make a vista through which you have an extensive view into the country the figures which consist of an angel tobias and a dog are descending an hill which forms the second distance the print with the description cannot be mistaken  the composition is very pleasing the trees on the foreground spreading over the top of the print and sloping to a point at the bottom give the beautiful form of an inverted pyramid which in trees especially has often a fine effect to this form the inclined plane on which the figures stand and which is beautifully broken is a good contrast the rock approaches to a perpendicular and the distance to an horizontal line all together make such a combination of beautiful and contrasting shapes that the whole is very pleasing if i should find fault with any thing it is the regularity of the rocks there is no variety in parrellel lines and it had been very easy to have broken them  the keeping is very accurate the second and third distance are both judiciously managed  the light is beautifully disposed to prevent heaviness it is introduced upon the tree both at the top and bottom but it is properly kept down a mass of shade succeeds upon the ground of the second distance and is continued upon the water the light breaks in a blaze upon the bottom of the rock and masses the whole the trees shrubs and upper part of the rock are happily thrown into a middle tint to prevent extravagance perhaps the effect of the distant country might have been better if all the lights upon it had been kept down except one easy catching light upon the town and the rising ground on which it stands  the execution is exceedingly beautiful no artist had an happier manner of expressing trees than waterlo and the tree before us is one of his capital works the shape of it we have already criticized the bole and ramification are as beautiful as the shape the foliage if i were not afraid of speaking the language of extravagance seems the work of enchantment such an union of strength and lightness is rarely found the extremities are touched with infinite tenderness the strong masses of light are relieved with shadows equally strong and yet great ease and softness are preserved the foreground is highly enriched and indeed the whole print and every part of it is full of art and full of nature  the deluge at coeverden by roman le hooghe this is an historical landscape a style very different from that of the last waterlo had nothing in view but to form an agreeable picture he had all nature before him through which his imagination might range the figures he introduced unconnected with his subject served only to embellish it any other figures would have answered his design as well but le hooghe was confined within narrower lines he had a country to describe and a story to tell the country is the environs of coeverden a dutch town with a view of that immense bank which the bishop of munster in the year      threw up and fortified at a vast expense to lay the town under water the story is the ruin of that bank which was broken through in three places by the violence of the waters in a storm the subject was great and difficult and yet the artist has acquitted himself in a masterly manner the town of coeverden fills the distant view the country is spread with a deluge the sky with a tempest and the breaches in the bank appear in all their horror  the composition in the distant and middle parts is as pleasing as such an extensive subject can be an elevated horizon which is always disgusting was necessary here to give a distinct view of the whole  the light too is thrown over the distant parts in good masses  the expression of the figures of the horses especially is very strong those which the driver is turning to avoid the horrid chasm before him are impressed with the wildest character of terror and indeed the whole scene of distress and the horrible confusion in every part of it are admirably described  the execution is not equal to that of many of le hooghes works the sky is hard and there is a dryness in the whole if in any part the master appears like himself it is in the figures on the left of the foreground  there are other faults in this print the shape of it is bad a little more length would have enlarged the idea and the town would have stood better not quite in the middle  but what is most faulty is the disproportion and littleness of the foreground on the right the spirit which the artist had maintained through the whole description flags miserably here whereas here he should have closed the whole with some vast and noble confusion which would have given keeping to the distant parts and struck the spectator with the strongest images of horror instead of this we are presented with a few pigs and calves floundering in the water the thought seems borrowed from ovid in the midst of a world in ruins not lupus inter oves  hogarths rakes progress the first print of this capital work is an excellent representation of a young heir taking possession of a misers effects the passion of avarice which hoards every thing without distinction what is and what is not valuable is admirably described  the composition though not excellent is not unpleasing the principal group consisting of the young gentleman the tailor the appraiser the papers and chest is agreeably shaped but the eye is hurt with the disagreeable regularity of three heads nearly in a line and at equal distances  the light is not illdisposed it falls on the principal figures but the effect might have been improved if the extreme parts of the mass the white apron on one side and the memorandumbook on the other had been in shade the repose had been less injured the detached parts of a group should rarely catch a strong body of light  we have no striking instances of expression in this print the principal figure is unmeaning the only one which displays the true vis comica of hogarth is the appraiser fingering the gold you enter at once into his character  the young woman might have furnished the artist with an opportunity of presenting a graceful figure which would have been more pleasing the figure he has introduced is by no means an object of allurement  the perspective is accurate but affected so many windows and open doors may show the authors learning but they break the background and injure the simplicity of it  the second print introduces our hero into all the dissipation of modish life we became first acquainted with him when a boy of eighteen he is now of age has entirely thrown off the clownish schoolboy and assumes the man of fashion instead of the countrytaylor who took measure of him for his fathers mourning he is now attended by frenchbarbers frenchtaylors poets milliners jockies bullies and the whole retinue of a fine gentleman  the expression in this print is wonderfully great the dauntless front of the bully the keen eye and elasticity of the fencingmaster and the simpering importance of the dancing master are admirably expressed the last is perhaps rather a little outre and it may be added but very indifferently drawn the architect is a strong copy from nature  the composition seems to be entirely subservient to the expression it appears as if hogarth had scetched in his memorandumbook all the characters which he has here introduced but was at a loss how to group them and chose rather to introduce them in detached figures as he had scetched them than to lose any part of the expression by combining them  the light is very ill distributed it is spread indiscriminately over the print and destroys the whole  we have no instance of grace in any of the figures the principal figure is very deficient there is no contrast in the limbs which is always attended with a degree of ungracefulness  the execution is very good it is elaborate and yet free  the satyr on operas though it may be welldirected is forced and unnatural  the third plate carries us still deeper in the history we meet our hero engaged in one of his eveningamusements this print on the whole is no very extraordinary effort of genius  the design is good and may be a very exact description of the humors of a brothel  the composition too is not amiss but we have few of those masterly strokes which distinguish the works of hogarth the whole is plain history the lady setting the world on fire is the best thought and there is some humor in furnishing the room with a set of caesars and not placing them in order  the light is illmanaged by a few alterations which are obvious particularly by throwing the lady dressing into the shade the disposition of it might have been tolerable but still we should have had an absurdity to answer whence comes it here is light in abundance but no visible source  expression we have very little through the whole print the principal figure is the best the ladies have all the air of their profession but no variety of character hogarths women are in general very inferior to his men for which reason i prefer the rakes progress to the harlots the femaleface indeed has seldom strength of feature enough to admit the strong markings of expression  very disagreeable accidents often befall gentlemen of pleasure an event of this kind is recorded in the fourth print which is now before us our hero going in full dress to pay his compliments at court on st davidsday was accosted in the rude manner which is here represented  the composition is good the form of the group made up of the figures in action the chair and the lamplighter is pleasing only here we have an opportunity of remarking that a group is disgusting when the extremities of it are heavy a group in some respect should resemble a tree the heavier part of the foliage the cup as the landskippainter calls it is always near the middle the outsidebranches which are relieved by the sky are light and airy an inattention to this rule has given a heaviness to the group before us the two bailiffs the woman and the chairman are all huddled together in that part of the group which should have been the lightest while the middle part where the hand holds the door wants strength and consistence it may be added too that the four heads in the form of a diamond make an unpleasing shape all regular figures should studiously be avoided  the light would have been well distributed if the bailiff holding the arrest and the chairman had been a little lighter and the woman darker the glare of the white apron is disagreeable  we have in this print some beautiful instances of expression the surprise and terror of the poor gentleman is apparent in every limb as far as is consistent with the fear of discomposing his dress the insolence of power in one of the bailiffs and the unfeeling heart in the other which can jest with misery are strongly marked the selfimportance too of the honest cambrian is not illportrayed who is chiefly introduced to settle the chronology of the story  in point of grace we have nothing striking hogarth might have introduced a degree of it in the female figure at least he might have contrived to vary the disagreeable and heavy form of her drapery  the perspective is good and makes an agreeable shape  i cannot leave this print without remarking the falling banbox such representations of quick motion are very absurd and every moment the absurdity grows stronger you cannot deceive the eye the falling body must appear not to fall objects of that kind are beyond the power of representation  difficulties crowd so fast upon our hero that at the age of twentyfive which he seems to have attained in the fifth plate we find him driven to the necessity of marrying a woman whom he detests for her fortune the composition here is very good and yet we have a disagreeable regularity in the climax of the three figures the maid the bride and the bridegroom  the light is not illdistributed the principal figure too is graceful and there is strong expression in the seeming tranquillity of his features he hides his contempt of the object before him as well as he can and yet he cannot do it she too has as much meaning as can appear through the deformity of her features the clergymans face we are well acquainted with and also his wig though we cannot pretend to say where we have seen either the clerk too is an admirable fellow  the perspective is well understood but the church is too small and the wooden post which seems to have no use divides the picture very disagreeably  the creed lost the commandments broken and the poorsbox obstructed by a cobweb are all excellent strokes of satirical humor  the fortune which our adventurer has just received enables him to make one push more at the gamingtable he is exhibited in the sixth print venting curses on his folly for having lost his last stake  this is upon the whole perhaps the best print of the set the horrid scene it describes was never more inimitably drawn the composition is artful and natural if the shape of the whole be not quite pleasing the figures are so well grouped and with so much ease and variety that you cannot take offense  in point of light it is more culpable there is not shade enough among the figures to balance the glare if the neckcloth and weepers of the gentleman in mourning had been removed and his hands thrown into shade even that alone would have improved the effect  the expression in almost every figure is admirable and the whole is a strong representation of the human mind in a storm three stages of that species of madness which atattends gaming are here described on the first shock all is inward dismay the ruined gamester is represented leaning against a wall with his arms across lost in an agony of horror perhaps never passion was described with so much force in a short time this horrible gloom bursts into a storm of fury he tears in pieces what comes next him and kneeling down invokes curses upon himself he next attacks others every one in his turn whom he imagines to have been instrumental in his ruin  the eager joy of the winning gamesters the attention of the usurer the vehemence of the watchman and the profound reverie of the highwayman are all admirably marked there is great coolness too expressed in the little we see of the fat gentleman at the end of the table the figure opposing the madman is bad it has a drunken appearance and drunkenness is not the vice of a gamingtable  the principal figure is ill drawn the perspective is formal and the execution but indifferent in heightening his expression hogarth has lost his spirit  the seventh plate which gives us the view of a jail has very little in it many of the circumstances which may well be supposed to increase the misery of a confined debtor are well contrived but the fruitful genius of hogarth i should think might have treated the subject in a more copious manner the episode of the fainting woman might have given way to many circumstances more proper to the occasion this is the same woman whom the rake discards in the first print by whom he is rescued in the fourth who is present at his marriage who follows him into jail and lastly to bedlam the thought is rather unnatural and the moral certainly culpable  the composition is bad the group of the woman fainting is a round heavy mass and the other group is very ill shapen the light could not be worse managed and as the groups are contrived can hardly be improved  in the principal figure there is great expression and the fainting scene is well described  a scheme to pay off the national debt by a man who cannot pay his own and the attempt of a silly rake to retrieve his affairs by a work of genius are admirable strokes of humor  the eighth plate brings the fortunes of our hero to a conclusion it is a very expressive representation of the most horrid scene which human nature can exhibit  the composition is not bad the group in which the lunatic is chained is well managed and if it had been carried a little further toward the middle of the picture and the two women who seem very odly introduced had been removed both the composition and the distribution of light had been good  the drawing of the principal figure is a more accurate piece of anatomy than i should have expected from hogarth the expression of this figure is rather unmeaning and very inferior to the strong characters of all the other lunatics the fertile genius of the artist has introduced as many of the causes of madness as he could well have collected though there is a little tautology there are two religionists and two astronomers yet there is variety in each and strong expression in all the characters the selfsatisfaction and conviction of him who has discovered the longitude the mock majesty of the monarch the moody melancholy of the lover and the superstitious horror of the popish devotee are all admirable  the perspective is simple and proper  chapter v cautions in collecting prints the collector of prints may be first cautioned against indulging a desire to become possessed of all the works of any master there are no masters whose works in the gross deserve notice no man is equal to himself in all his compositions i have known a collector of rembrandt ready to give any price for a print or two which he wanted to complete his collection though it had been to rembrandts credit if those prints had been suppressed there is no doubt but if one third of the works of this master should be tried by the rules of just criticism they would appear of little value the great prince eugene it is said was a collector of this kind and piqued himself upon having in his possession all the works of all the masters his collection was bulky and cost fourscore thousand pounds but when sifted could not at that time of day be worth so many hundreds  the collector of prints may secondly be cautioned against a superstitious veneration for names a true judge leaves the master out of the question and only examines the work but with a little genius nothing sways like a great name it carries a wonderful force covers glaring faults and creates imaginary beauties that species of criticism is certainly just which examines the different manners of different masters with a view to discover in how many ways a good effect may be produced and which produces the best but to be curious in finding out a master in order there to rest the judgment is a kind of criticism very paultry and illiberal it is judging of the work by the master instead of judging of the master by the work hence it is that such vile prints as the woman in the cauldron and mount parnassus obtain credit among connoisseurs if you ask wherein their beauty consists you are informed they are engraved by mark antonio and if that do not satisfy you you are further assured they are after raphael this absurd taste raised an honest indignation in that ingenious artist picart who having shown the world by his excellent imitations how ridiculous it is to pay a blind veneration to names tells us that he had compared some of the engravings of the ancient masters with the original pictures and found them very bad copies he speaks of the stiffness which in general runs through them  of the hair of children which resembles pothooks  and of the ignorance of those engravers in anatomy drawing and the distribution of light  a third caution which may be of use in collecting prints is not to rate their value by their scarceness scarceness will make a valuable print more valuable but to make scarceness the standard of a prints value is to mistake an accident for merit this folly is founded in vanity and arises from a desire of possessing what no body else can possess the want of real merit is made up by imaginary and the object is intended to be kept not looked at yet absurd as this false taste is nothing is more common and a trifling genius may be found who will give ten guineas for hollars shells which valued according to their real merit the scarcity of them being added to the account are not worth more than as many shillings  instances in abundance might be collected of the prevalence of this folly le clerc in his print of alexanders triumph had given a profile of that prince the print was shown to the duke of orleans who was pleased with it on the whole but justly enough objected to the sideface the obsequious artist erased it and engraved a full one a few impressions had been taken from the plate in its first state which sell among the curious for ten times the price of the impressions taken after the face was altered  callot once pleased with a little plate of his own etching made an hole in it through which he drew a ribbon and wore it at his button the impressions after the hole was made are very scarce and amazingly valuable  vandyke etched a print of the holy family in which st john was represented laying his hand upon the virgins shoulder the print before it was published was shown among his critical friends some of whom thought the action of st john too familiar the painter was convinced and removed the hand but he was mistaken when he thought he added value to his print by the alteration the impressions which got abroad with the hand upon the shoulder would buy up all the rest three times over in any auction in london  many of rembrandts prints receive infinite value from little accidental alterations of this kind a few impressions were taken from one plate before a dog was introduced from another before a white horsetail was turned into a black one from a third before a signpost was inserted at an alehouse door and all the scarce prints from these plates though altered for the better are the prints of value the rest are common and cheap  i shall conclude these instances with a story of a late celebrated collector of pictures he was showing his collection with great satisfaction and after expatiating upon many noble works by guido marratti and other masters he turned suddenly to the gentleman whom he attended and now sir said he i will show you a real curiosity there is a woverman without a horse in it  the circumstance it is true was uncommon but was unluckily that very circumstance which made the picture of little value  let the collector of prints be cautioned fourthly to beware of buying copies for originals most of the works of the capital masters have been copied and many of them so well that if a person be not versed in prints he may easily be deceived were the copies really as good as the originals the name would signify nothing but like translations they necessarily fall short of the spirit of the original and contract a stiffness from the fear of erring when seen apart they look well but when compared with the originals the difference easily appears thus callot s beggars have been so well copied that the difference between the originals and the copies would not immediately strike you but when you compare them it is obvious there is a plain want of freedom the characters are less strongly marked and the extremities are less accurately touched  it is a difficult matter to give rules to assist in distinguishing the copy from the original in most cases the engravers name or his mark which should be well known will be a sufficient direction these the copyist is seldom hardy enough to forge but in anonymous prints it is matter of more difficulty all that can be done is to attend carefully to the freedom of the manner in the extremities especially in which the copyist is more liable to fail when you are pretty well acquainted with the manner of a master you cannot well be deceived when you are not your best way is to be directed by those who are  the last caution i shall give to the collector of prints is to take care he purchase not bad impressions  there are three things which make an impression bad  the first is it is being ill taken off some prints seem to have received the force of the roller at intervals the impression is double and gives that glimmering appearance which illudes the eye  a second thing which makes an impression bad is a worn plate there is as much difference between the first and the last impression of the same plate as between two different prints the effect is wholly lost in a faint impression and you have nothing left but a vapid design without spirit and without force in metzotinto especially a strong impression is desirable for the spirit of a metzotinto quickly evaporates without which it is the most insipid of all prints in engraving and etching there will be always here and there a dark touch which long preserves an appearance of spirit but metzotinto is a flat surface and when it begins to wear it wears all over too many of the works of all the great masters which are commonly hawked about at auctions or sold in shops are in this wretched state it is difficult to meet with a good impression the salvators rembrandts and waterlos which we meet with now except here and there in some choice collection are seldom better than mere reverses you see the form of the print but the elegant and masterly touches are gone backgrounds and foregrounds are jumbled together by the confusion of all distance and you have rather the shadow of a print left than the print itself  the last thing which makes a bad impression is retouching a worn plate sometimes this is performed by the master himself and then the spirit of the impression may be still preserved but most commonly the retouching part is done by some bungler into whose hands the plate has fallen and then it is most execrable in a worn plate at least what you have is good you have the remains of something excellent and if you are versed in the works of the master your imagination may be agreeably exercised in making out what is lost but when the plate has gone through the hands of a bungler who has worked it over with his infamous scratches the idea of the master is lost and you have nothing left but strong harsh and unmeaning lines upon a faint ground which is the most disagreeable compound with which the eye can be presented such prints and many such there are though offered us under the name of rembrandt or waterlo are of little value those masters would not have owned such works  yet as we are often obliged to take up with such impressions as we can get let us rather choose the faint impression than the retouched one  the end
