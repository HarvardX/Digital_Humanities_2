the pasquinade with notes variorum  book the first  ay it is a crust a lasting crust for the rogues i would be glad to see the proudest of them all but dare to nibble at this  if they do it will rub their gums for them i promise you bays london printed and sold by c mountfort near the royal exchange mdccliii price one shilling  the pasquinade book the first pasquinade as it is highly necessary that every writer who publishes his works for the instruction and emolument of the public should write in such a manner as to be understood by those of a common capacity as well as by those who as the poet says  peruse a work of wit with the same spirit that its author writ or if he does not as it is highly becoming the scholiast to make them familiar to such readers i should think myself very unworthy to illustrate the following poem did i pass over the name itself which though some critics may understand i am persuaded many do not  know then that pasquin was cobbler who worked in his stall at rome about the beginning of the fifteenth century and being a fellow of ready wit and a satirical disposition the people flocked about him to hear him rally and talk politics at which he was very expert after his decease the statue of a gladiator being dug up near his stall it was set up and called pasquin the wits his pupils taking it in their heads in honor to their dead master to stick their lampoons satires and libels thereon all which were termed pasquinades if thou doubtest reader whether this poem was ever hung on the said statue if thou take a walk to a certain corner of the palace of ursines in rome thou may enquire further concerning it o chief in verse o every muses care line   o chief in verse the great personage here addressed from what we may gather from the following lines can be no other than dr john hill acad rege scient burd etc soc and inspector general of great britain  pride of each mortal and immortal fair whether enraptured with uranias charms lines     whether enraptured etc these lines seem to hint at the amors of mr inspector who has so often celebrated in his works his chloes daphnes and amandas all ladies of quality whose favors some have been bold enough to say have been of the same nature with those he received from the muses purely imaginary but we presume not to assert this opinion till we have some authority to suppose those ladies as chaste as the sisters of parnassus  or sunk in chloe or amandas arms whether eternal bays thy temples grace or thy laced nightcap well supplies their place line   or thy laced nightcap a

libitina fine conflictu woodwards letter etc  or in philosophy profoundly wise you pore intent with microscopic eyes line  0 you pore intent with microscopic eyes from the contradiction this passage seems to imply to that of another great author and philosopher who says why has not man a microscopic eye  it might possibly be concluded that some mistake had happened either in transcribing or printing this line and that our author intended it through microscopic eyes meaning the eyes or the glasses of his microscope but if any credit may be given to this gentlemans discoveries in natural philosophy we must conclude he himself is possessed of eyes infinitely more discerning than the rest of the virtuosi having found out such animalculae and their method of existence as no other philosopher ever did or ever will though assisted by all the helps of the most improved microscope unless possessed of the same kind of eyes the visual rays to which are so ductile that they not only are directed from real objects but from no objects at all  which accomplishment alone should sufficiently establish this great man as the prince of philosophers and empower him to correct and censure the researches of others as we must own the eye that can see what is invisible is certainly more able to explore the secrets of nature than that which can see only what is to be seen  i find no reason therefore to vary the reading in the text    new worlds discover in a catharine pear line    new worlds discover in a catharine pear among the philosophic researches hinted in the preceding annotation take the following made by this gentleman on a rotten pear   it was but a very small portion of the covered furface of the pear that could be brought within the area of the microscope but this appeared under its influence a wide extent of territory varied with hills and lawns with winding hollows open plains and shadowy thickets inspector a very material objection indeed arises against our author in respect that he calls it a catharine pear as this philosopher in his preamble to the experiment expressly says it was a french pear in which we cannot think him mistaken as he took such particular notice of the said pear for says he it was cut by a person very fond of pears who out of that excessive fondness eat a thin slice and reserved the rest to another opportunity that he cried pah at seeing it again when rotten and that it was cut at the largest end  vide inspector     so that from these circumstances we must remark this as an error in our author    or monsters animate in sour small beer serenely trace their fundamental breath line    fundamental breath alluding to an animal which this profound enquirer into nature discovered whose organs of respiration are situated in its fundament and which continually swims with its head under water and its tail above for fear of being drowned a very singular kind of creature it must be owned and it is presumed a very clean one as to no other part of its body are assigned the offices which we should readily suppose were those of the part mentioned vide inspector      in this passage our author like other great writers it must be confessed does not pay the strictest regard to historical truth as the monster here spoken of is not said to be engendered in small beer but was the polite inhabitant of kensington    whilst thy grim lion grinds thy foes to death line    whilst thy grim lion grinds thy foes to death our author seems here to have an eye to a very curious piece of history in the london daily advertiser of january        which runs thus  we hear from the bedford coffeehouse in covent garden that an unhappy gentleman of that neighborhood having yesterday morning in wantonness thrust his head into the mouth of the lion that resides there felt the jaws unexpectedly close upon him on this enquiring with a hollow voice whether he shook his tail and being answered in the affirmative he begged the bystanders to pray for him a terrible crash was immediately after heard and notwithstanding the uncommon resisstance of the skull it is credibly reported that the teeth met through it he was immediately after conveyed home but his surgeons are afraid the wounds will prove mortal dr hill it is not material to consider how much wit or truth is in this paragraph if it serves to give the public a great idea of the said lion    o let my humble verse attention claim nor deem the friend beneath the poets name blessed in thy own inspectatorial style line    inspectatorial style a manner of writing peculiar to this great man which has so often been imitated by the superficial writers of the present age and which our author seems to speak of as inimitable the reader if any such there be who is unacquainted with this style will conceive some idea of it from the following specimens  speaking of a little rivulet or ditch he says  the translucent waves coursed one another down the light declivity with an inexpressibly pleasing variety of form and a confused but very soft noise of bubbling lashing and murmuring among against and along the inequalities and meanders of its rough sides and various hollows of a pond he says  the surface of the basin was a polished plane unfurrowed by the least motion unruffled by the gentlest breeze the setting sun threw a glow of pale splendour over one half of it the rest was silent shade  on weeds etc gathered to one corner of a ditch  the fresh breeze had blown together into this part of the watery expanse whatever floated on or near its surface  how philosophically exact among against and along  on or near at the same time how poetical and florid translucent waves meanders gentlest breeze the glow of splendour and expanse hence reader if thou have perchance seen only the faint imitations of this beautiful style thou may conceive a more correct idea of what our author here so pathetically laments the want of vide inspectors                you nobly scorn to hear the numbers toil to see them fettered down to mood and tense and groan beneath the infirmity of sense void of politeness elegance and ease ah what is

abler critics to complain of a misfortune which he fears will prevent his success in poetry for no less a critic and poet than the great mr dryden says he who servilely creeps after sense is safe but never can reach to excellence   hear then ye daughters of immortal jove by the soft vows of your inspectors love if not too jealous of each others flame you slight the lover for a rivals claim or if

my song and crown me with applause i sing dire faction and the cruel strife of bards that live and bards that write for life line    of bards that live and bards that write for life i am apprizd that this line may be taken in a varied sense  some may imagine that by a mans writing for life is intended his writing for a livelihood and that by bards that live are meant those who live independent of writing as it is expressed by this line  these live to write and those must write to live a kind of distinction which seems to have been handed down from that immortal philosopher lord chancellor bacon who is said to have complained to king james the first lest he should be reduced to study to live rather than live to study i cannot however think this our authors drift but that by writing for life he meant writing as hard as one can drive and that he had in his eye that part of the old ballad of the wife of bath when adam heard her say these words he ran away for life in which case as adam according to the tradition is in paradise or heaven he could not be supposed to run to preserve his life so that it is clear our author intended only to convey the eagerness of the pursuit of those bards who had the measure allowed he might have said write away for life    of fiddlers coxcombs harlequins and playrs physicians parsons fools and dancing bears line  0 dancing bears the reader is not to take this expression literally or think the poet celebrates real four legged bears or that he had any view to the famous ursi domestici mirabili that yielded the inspector an opportunity of being so very witty last summer or to those gentle bruins that now expose themselves by dancing hornpipes in the streets it is plain he intends no more by the word bear than as sir alexander drawcansir has defined that appellation in his complete modern glossary  bear  a country gentleman or any creature on two legs that does not make a good bow covent garden journal no   neither does our author proceed only on precedent having also philosophical authority for carolus linnaeus suecus whom i must own i have never read  the first of natural philosophers as the world with justice styles
