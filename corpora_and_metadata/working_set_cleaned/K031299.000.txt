avenge her unmoved by rage my soul maintains her purpose through one unaltered course and often before as i have guided thy unruly spirit against its wildness will i now protect thee and from a base inhuman action save thee  boadicia thy boasted calmness is the child of fear thou tremblest to exasperate the foe well was it britons in our former conquests that i presided over the scene of slaughter else had those thousands of the roman youth whose bodies lie extended on our fields stood at this hour a threatening host against you come then ye warriors follow your conductress and drag these slaves to death  dumnorix they will not move fixed with amazement at thy matchless frenzy do thou revere these warriors who with scorn observe thy folly  venusia husband sister hear oh if my humbled voice my prostrate limbs if tears and sighs of anguish may atone for this pernicious discord i have raised   boadicia to venusia hence with thy despicable sighs and tears to dumnorix and thou presumptuous what invidious power foe to thy safety animates thy pride still to contend with boadicias wrath  dumnorix no by andate i contend not with thee at this important season when the soldier thirsts for the conflict it would ill become me to trifle here in discord with a woman nay do not swell that haughty breast in vain when once the sacred evidence of justice illuminates my bosom on a rock which neither tears can soften nor the gusts of passion move my resolution stands  boadicia now heaven fulfill my curses on thy head may every purpose of thy soul be frustrate may infamy and ruin

yonder hill  boadicia to the britons ungrateful and perfidious now would i draw my spirit from your camp leave you with him defenseless and exposed then should your shattered chariots be overthrown

scene the seventh dumnorix venusia ebrancus and trinobantians venusia my lord and husband  dumnorix wherefore do thou hold me and in my passage thy endearments plant i must prepare this moment to confront the foul and ghastly face of cruel war and by the gods i rather court at present that shape of horror than thy beauteous form then go thou dear intruder and remove thy softness from me  venusia i will stay no longer than brave tenantius has performed thy orders long have i known thy valor skilled to throw the rapid dart and lift the unconquered shield a confidence like this has still diffused enough of firmness through my womans heart never to molest thee with a womans fears this day excepted now my weakness governs and terror too importunate will speak have thou encountered yet such mighty powers as down that mountain suddenly will rush from every part the romans are assembled all versed in arms and terrible in valor  dumnorix tell me thou lovely coward am not i as terrible or falls the roman sword on the tough buckler and the crested helm with deadlier weight than mine away and fear not secure and calm repose thee in thy tent think on thy husband and believe he conquers amid the rage of battle he will think on thee for thee he draws the martial blade for thy loved infants gripes the pointed ash go and expect me to return victorious thy hand shall dress my wounds and all be well  venusia far better be our fortune than for thee to want that office from my faithful hand or me to stain thy triumphs with my tears  dumnorix fear not i tell thee when thou see my limbs with dust bespread my brows with glorious sweat and some distinguished wound to grace my breast thou in the fullness of thy love shallt view me and swear i seem most comely in thy fight thy virtue then shall show me worthier of thee than did thy fondness on our nuptial day  venusia it shall be so all wounded thou shall find my heart prepared to stifle its regret and smooth my forehead with obedient calmness yet hear me further something will i offer more than the weak effects of female dread thou go to fight in discord with thy colleague it is a thought which multiplies my fears  dumnorix well urged thou dearest counselor who best can heal this mischief let thy meekness try the soft persuasion of a private confrence to win from error a bewildered sister while none are present to alarm her pride  venusia i go but trembling doubt my vain attempt unless commissioned with thy dear injunctions my soul exerted to perform thy pleasure could give persuasion all my force of duty

to begin the onset my trinobantians it is time to seek thembattled foe and you alljudging gods look down benignant on a righteous cause indeed we cannot give you like the romans a proud and sumptuous offering we abound not in marble temples or in splendid altars yet though we want this vain luxurious pomp rough though we wander on the mountains head through the deep vale and over the craggy rock we still demand your favor we can show hands which for justice draw the avenging steel firm hearts and manners undebasd by fraud to you my dauntless friends what need of words your cities have been sacked your children slain your wives dishonored lo on yonder hills you see the spoilers there the ruffians stand your hands are armed then follow and revenge  end of the first act act ii scene the first flaminius and aenobarbus flaminius ho aenobarbus thou may now come forward what has thy angry soul been brooding over  aenobarbus well thou have sud and have obtained thy suit of these barbarians meanly have implored thy wretched life and have it must i thank thee for this uncommon privilege to stand a tame spectator of the roman shame to see exulting savages oerturn our walls and ramparts see them with the spoils of our waste dwellings with our captive eagles and ancient trophies ravished from our temples march in rude triumph over the gods of rome  flaminius what thou had rather die  aenobarbus and thou had rather live like a dog in chains than die with courage thou most unworthy of the roman name  flaminius did those who now inhabit rome deserve the name of romans did the ancient spirit of our forefathers still survive among us i should applaud this bold contempt of life our ancestors who lived while rome was free might well prefer a noble fate to chains they lost a blessing we have never known born and inured to servitude at home we only change one master for another and dumnorix is far beyond a nero  aenobarbus meanst thou to mock me  flaminius no i mean to show thy stern opinions suit not with the times  aenobarbus still by our valor we control the world and in that duty will i match the foremost if our forefathers manners be neglected free from that blame i singly will maintain them my sentiments are molded by my spirit which wants thy pliant qualities to yield with every gust of fortune rude or mild and crouch beneath example base or worthy  flaminius well if thou can not brook a british master   aenobarbus no nor thy wanton folly will i brook which sports alike with slavery or freedom insensible of shame  flaminius suppose i free thee  aenobarbus free me  flaminius this day if fortune be propitious  aenobarbus ha do not cheat me with delusive fables and trifle with my bonds  flaminius by all my hopes i do not trifle  aenobarbus willt thou give my bosom once more to buckle on the soldiers harness and meet in battle our insulting foes shall my keen falchion gore the flying rout and raise a bleeding trophy to revenge for each indignity which rome has borne hold me no longer in suspense instruct me from whence these hopes proceed  flaminius thou know i loved the british princess  aenobarbus have thou raised my hopes to freedom future victory and honor and do thou talk of love  flaminius that love shall save us thou saw the gentle emmeline but now stole to our tent and gave her tenderest welcome unchanged i found her soft and artless still the generous maid already has suggested the means of flight the battle once begun while every briton is intent on war herself will guide us to a place of safety  aenobarbus now i commend thee  flaminius thou approvst then  aenobarbus ay  flaminius and see the joyful moment is approaching see where thunnumberd trinobantians spread in rude disorder over the vale beneath whose broad extent this eminence commands mark their widewaving multitude confused with mingling standards and tumultuous cars but far superior to the rest behold the brave and generous dumnorix erect with eager hope his lofty javelin shakes and with unpolished majesty adorns the front of war  aenobarbus i mark the rabble well and soon shall view the romans from their station between those woods which shade the adverse hills sweep with resistless ardour to the vale and trample over the savages like dust  flaminius that smiling vale with pity i contemplate and wish more gentle footsteps might be seen to press its verdure and that softer notes than wars terrific clamours might be tuned from those surrounding shades to join the murmurs of that fair channel whose sonorous bed receives the stream descending from this grove to form the limpid maze which shines below  aenobarbus i see it glistning in the noonday sun but british gore will change its glassy hue  flaminius oh might we rather on its friendly banks erect a grateful monument to peace that she her sway resuming might afford me to clasp the gallant dumnorix and style him my friend my benefactor and preserver  stand from before this tempest while it passes  scene the second boadicia icenians aenobareus and flaminius at a distance boadicia oh i could drive this javelin through my heart to ease its tortures disobeyed controlled

indignation pauses the trinobantians are advanced before me let them sustain the onset let the romans on dumnorix with every cohort press till he entreat for boadicias aid then shall my eager eyes enjoy his ruin and when the insulting boaster is overthrown his bands dispersed or gasping in the dust then will i rush exulting in my car like fierce andate on the wearied foe lead rout and slaughter through a tide of gore impel my clotted wheels redeem the day and from the mouth of danger snatching conquest crown my revenge with glory  scene the third boadicia icenians aenobarbus and flaminius at a distance and venusia venusia stand apart at my request icenians o unbend to boad that louring brow and hear a suppliant sister so prone to error is our mortal frame time could not step without a trace of horror if wary nature on the human heart amid its wild variety of passions had not impressed a soft and yielding sense that when offenses give resentment birth the kindly dews of penitence may raise the seeds of mutual mercy and forgiveness  boadicia weak wretch and yet whose impotence aspires to mix in warlike councils and determine the fate of captives won in fields of death thou would do better to reserve thy tears thou shallt have cause for penitential torrents  venusia they will not wait a second birth of woe at thy severity they burst already why turns on me that formidable aspect wont with commanding sternness to behold its foes abashed and victory its vassal yet how much brighter is the wreath of glory when interwove with clemency and justice thou go to battle there obtain renown but learn compassion from my tears nor think benignity enfeebles or dishonours the most exalted valor  boadicia shall the tears of abject importunity detain me while vengeance striding from his grizly den with fell impatience grinds his iron teeth and waits my nod to satisfy his hunger hence to the employment of thy feeble distaff  venusia not skilled like thee in wars ennobling toils inferior praise and humbler tasks i court and own my safety in thy loftier virtues yet not like thee with unforgiving wrath could i resign a sister to her grief at this tremendous hour so near deciding the fate of both one gentle word bestow and i will leave thee with obedient haste nay i will seek the altars and request that in the future triumphs of this day heaven may refuse to dumnorix a share and give thee all  boadicia does dumnorix consent to sacrifice the romans art thou mute still does he brave me but your favored captives shall not escape they soon shall join the victims which this unconquered javelin shall reserve to solemnize the fall of romes dominion then to my glory dumnorix shall bend in sight of britain shall his baffled pride the pomp of public sacrifice behold behold and pine you take a band of soldiers to an icenian watch well around the trinobantian tents and guard these romans as your lives i tell thee to venus their gore shall yet besmear andates altar  venusia in silent awe i heard thy first resentment yet hoped the well known accents of affection in kindness whispered to thy secret ear might to thy breast recall its exiled pity that gentle inmate of a womans heart  boadicia durst thou presumptuous entertain a thought to give this bosom nervd with manly strength the weak sensations of a female spirit  venusia when i remind thy elevated soul that we by mutual interests are but one and by the indissoluble ties of birth are those sensations weak which nature prompts with justice strengthened can her powerful voice find no persuasion   boadicia none provoke no more with plaintive murmurs my indignant ear thou and thy husband authors of my shame before the assembled chiefs may rest assured no prayers shall soften no atonement bribe and no submission shall appease the wrong may desolation trample on my dwelling a second time rapacious force again and insult revel through my inmost chambers if i forgive you thou have food for anguish go and indulge its appetite at leisure  venusia yes i will hasten to the holy shrine there wring my hands and melt in copious sorrow not for my injured self but thee remorseless to mourn thy faded honors which deformed by harsh injustice to thy blameless friends never will revive in beauty not success not trophies rising round thee not the throng of circling captives and their conquered standards nor glorious dust of victory can hide from just reproach thy unrelenting scorn while none deplore thee but the wronged venusia  scene the fourth boadicia icenians aenobarbus

thou yon dreadful woman will return from us she moves though slowly then take comfort  flaminius far other cares than terror fill my breast  aenobarbus what means this languor wherefore heaves that sigh  flaminius o aenobarbus willt thou bear my weakness i see the moment of deliverance near yet pine with grief  aenobarbus whatever the folly be with which thy bosom teems the gods confound it  flaminius to see the dearest object of my soul just see her after such a tedious absence then vanish from her sight perhaps for ever when these reflections rise the sweet exchange from bonds to freedom which to her i owe is mixed with bitterness and joy subsides  aenobarbus why did thou leave the fair italian fields thou silken slave of venus what could move thee to explore these boisterous northern climes and change yon radiant sky for britains clouds what do thou here effeminate by heaven thou should have loiterd in campanias villas and in thy garden nursed with careful hands the gaudyvested progeny of flora or indolently paced the pebbled shore and eyed the beating of the tuscan wave to waste thy irksome leisure will it thou tell me what thou do here in britain do thou come to sigh and pine could italy afford no food for these weak passions must thou traverse such tracts of land and visit this cold region to love and languish answer me what motive first brought thee hither but forbear to urge it was in quest of honor for the god of war disclaims thee  flaminius well suppose i answer that friendship drew me from the golden tiber with thee to combat this inclement sky will it offend thee  aenobarbus no i am thy friend and i will make a roman of thee still but let me see no languishing dejection more on thy brow nor hear unmanly sighs gods can thou dream of love when yonder se the roman legions all arrayed for battle are now descending see their dreaded eagles their dazzling helmets and their crimson plumes a grove of javlins glitters down the steep they point their terrors on the astonished foe soon will they charge the britons in the vale and with the auspicious glories of this day enrich the annals of imperial rome o cursed captivity with double weight i feel thee now malicious fate to suffer a roman thus to stand confined in bondage and see the triumphs which he cannot share by heaven flaminius i will never bear it where is thy briton will she lead us hence else by the god of war unarmed i rush to join the glorious scene which opens there  flaminius i see her coming and will fly to meet her  aenobarbus our time is short remember do not dally  scene the sixth aenobarbus i have a thought lies ripening in my breast and teems with future glory if the fight prove undecisive and these tents subsist soon will i bid thee hostile camp farewell thou saw me come in thraldom i depart a fugitive if ever i return thou shallt receive me in another guise then shallt thou feel me when my shining helm shall strike cold terror through thy boldest guards and from its lofty crest destruction shake  end of the second act act iii scene the first flaminius and aenobarbus flaminius our lovely guide attends us thy impatience has called me

destiny is fixed whatever her merciless revenge may purpose elate with conquest or incensed by loss if on the rack to strain our bursting sinews if from the bleeding trunks to lop our lims or with slow fires protract the hours of pain we must abide it all collect thy spirit and like a roman dauntless wait thy doom  flaminius i hear thee but thy meaning   aenobarbus hear again before the tent

then called a numerous band who prowl around us as a destined prey  flaminius malicious fortune  aenobarbus now thou see my meaning  flaminius our flight were vain while these observe us  aenobarbus
