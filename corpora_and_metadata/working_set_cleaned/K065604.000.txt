etc cambridge june         sir i freely own to you when i sat down to write my defense of sir isaac newton and the british mathematicians i was not a little moved at the treatment you had been pleased to give to one or two of those great men whom i am proud to call my master and whose memories on that account i shall always reverence and honor but now you tell me i may be supposed cool i am so partly through the length of time that has intervened and partly by considering the severity of the discipline you have undergone it has had i see a mavelous effect upon you one may plainly perceive an alteration notwithstanding your endeavors to conceal it not only in your sentiments but in your language your behavior and your very air you no longer breathe that superiority and contempt of all mankind you were wont to show this change in you has greatly mitigated the passion with which i was before overcome  in this calm and cool state therefore when i reflect upon what is past i am not a little startled at my own audaciousness and presumption in entering the lists against so redoubtable an adversary as the author of the minute philosopher to you likewise i find this presumption of mine appeared so extraordinary that though you are so good as to qualify it by the softer name of courage you could not but admire it it seemed unaccountable to you till you reflected on my seeming secure in the favor of one part of my readers and the ignorance of the other  nevertheless you are persuaded there are fair and candid men among the mathematicians i likewise am persuaded not only that there are fair and candid men among the mathematicians but that generally speaking mathematicians are fair and candid men what should make them otherwise are their opinions digested into creeds and articles and established by law has the public thought fit to bestow dignities and large possessions on them which are not to be obtained without embracing those opinions nor to be retained without persevering in them were even this the case yet surely there would be found among them fair and candid men i am sure i know many such among another set of men in these very circumstances  ay but this other set of men you will say have nothing but truth to defend i grant it and i take this to be the case of the mathematicians likewise they are at least as good reasoners as any other set of men whatsoever and consequently are as likely to know truth when they meet it and have nothing to hinder them from embracing it it is therefore on their judgment not their favor that i depend  but you speak of the ignorance of the other part of my readers alas sir of what advantage can that be to me to me philalethes who aim at truth alone who have no interest in deceiving them  were i indeed the author of the minute philosopher had i any other end to serve than truth were i master of assurance enough to mislead my reader at the instant that i call out to him to mind his way to desire him to examine while i am misinforming him to throw dust in his eyes and bid him see then undoubtedly much might be done but these are arts i neither need nor practice i content my self with the plain honest way of giving my reader the best light i can neither misleading him my self nor suffering him to be misled by others with this view it is that i divide my reply into the same number of sections with your defense and confine my sections to the same matter with yours this will indeed make what i have to say somewhat less methodical but then it will enable the reader more easily to compare us together and to make a more certain decision between us  the taking this method sir will make it plainly appear that what i aim at is only manifesting the truth and consequently that the reason of my courage in encountering you is my being verily persuaded that i have truth and justice on my side i know and am aware of your superior accomplishments but philalethes is my name and truth will prevail against the pens of men or angels your vanity has engaged you in a difficulty from which all your abilities shall never extricate you  verte omnes tete in facies and contrahe quicquid sive animis sive art vales your arms are wedged in the oak you have presumptuously attempted to rend your strength is no longer of any use to defend you a woman a child may be too hard for you  ii your second section teaches us that things obscure are not therefore sacred and that it is no more a crime to canvass and detect unsound principles or false reasonings in mathematics than in any other part of learning i agree with you i go farther it can never be a crime but on the contrary is highly laudable to canvass and to examine the principles and reasoning made use of in any science whatsoever and that with the utmost freedom and impartiality all ingenuous minds will be pleased with such an examination they will readily consent that the science they profess be brought to the severest and strictest trial truth can never be hurt by inquiry truth loves the light but error falsehood and imposture dread and abhor it  iii i am much at a loss here you speak of men who reject that very thing in religion which they admit in human learning do they admit that fluxions are to them most incomprehensible mysteries do they notwithstanding this concession believe them to be clear and scientifick do they notwithstanding this belief entertain an implicit faith in the author of that method these things seem hard to reconcile  iv i do not ask why you chose to defame mathematicians in the month of march ann dom      rather than at any time before the only question with me was whether vanity or christianity were the motive to writing the analyst quae relligio aut quae machina belli i have fully proved there was no religion no christianity in it it was partly vanity partly machine  v here i would observe that whoever admires fluxions must admire them for something of excellence he sees in the method of fluxions and consequently cannot justly be said to yield faith to the inventor of that method but this whole section seems to me to be matter of secret history and declamation of the worst sort namely the defamatory  vi more secret history and declamation partly about what no body denies and partly about what no body believes you give us to understand you have a right to examine fluxions even though religion were quite unconcerned and though you had no end to serve but truth no body disputes your right of examining but surely no good can be expected from the examination of a person who has any end to serve but truth let that end be what it will but pray what is this other end this end different from truth that you have to serve it looks as if religion were meant but i hope better things of you a christian and a preacher of the gospel truth and the christian religion are one i profess i am greatly puzzled i have taken as much pains to understand this passage as i sincerely believe you have done to make sense of sir isaac newton s principles a friend of mine is of opinion the passage has been corrupted either by the transcribers or the printer and bids me for religion read promotion ita legendum censeo says he reclamantibus centum tonsonis i am apt to think he is in the right partly because i take him to be a very able critic and partly because this emendation though considerably differing from the vulgar reading serves to confirm the proof i had before given that your end was neither truth nor religion  you tell me i am very angry and refer to page    and    of my defense i have looked over those pages to see what signs of anger i have there shown what injury what affront i have there offered you all i can find is that i have proposed to you the example of our savior and of st paul i beg your pardon sir i took you for one of their followers  you will not take upon you to say you know me to be a minute philosopher i am much obliged to you for this tenderness and should be more so if it appeared that you knew so much as one letter of my name but it seems you would not be concerned if others should take me to be such a one you speak of my spleen against the clergy and you tell me the minute philosophers make just such compliments as i do to our church here i apprehend you mistake the compliments i make to yourself and a few of your credulous friends for compliments to the body of the clergy i assure you i look upon the body of the clergy as a body of learned and useful men i know and am known to a great many individuals among them whom i highly esteem and honor i have spoke of some of them in my defense with singular respect if i laugh at any it is at such as think you do service to the church in writing the analyst if i dislike any they are such as are perpetually grasping at dominion and riches no wonder i am a layman if the clergy obtain more power i shall have less liberty if they will have more wealth i am one of those must pay to it  vii the chief purport of this section seems to be to strengthen the proof you had before given of the infidelity of mathematicians you had told us in the analyst you were not a stranger to it it was known you were credibly informed now you go farther you make no doubt of it you have seen shrewed signs you have been very credibly informed can any thing be plainer i declare myself fully satisfied with this proof even without the story told you by mr addison of a witty man who was an infidel because of the infidelity of a certain noted mathematician surely this witty man was in jest at least he was no wise man  viii ix x in these three sections i meet with nothing but declamation the subject of it is my passion and injustice my railing and raging my rhetoric and writing tragedy your own sincerity and laudable endeavors to do service to mathematical learning the proper respect you treat sir isaac newton with and the decency with which you dissent from him for which last the reader is desired to have recourse to the analyst particularly to the thirtyfirst query where sir isaac newton is plainly charged with writing nonsense  as to my frightful visions and tragical uproars about the inquisition and the gallows you may laugh at them as much as you please but i have heard of persons hanged and burnt upon as slender evidence as that which you bring against mathematicians and what has been may be especially if the wholesome ancient discipline should ever be restored which some persons say is much to be wished i confess i am not of their mind and i hope the body of the british laity see too plainly the use that would be made of such a power ever to trust you gentlemen with it  hoc regnum dea gentibus esse si qua fata sinant jam jam tenditque fovetque xi you say you heartily abhor an inquisition in faith upon my word you have a great deal of reason you have been a grievous freethinker in your time i do not mean in mathematics only as great a bigot as i am possessed with the true spirit of an inquisitor i assure you i should be very sorry that you and i were at the mercy of some men i could name they seem to me to be singularly well qualified to preside in the holy office and i doubt they would make us confess that something else existed in nature besides spirit and ideas  xii more declamation about my declaiming and your own modesty and the compliment you pay to sir isaac newtons understanding but sir i dont like that word sophism it seems not very consistent with the decency and proper respect you so lately talked of  xiii xiv xv xvi you tell me the adoration that i pay to sir isaac newton you will pay only to truth that i may be an idolater of whom i please but i have no right to insult and exclaim at other men because they do not adore my idol that i inveigh against you because you are not guilty of my mean idolatry   to deify his power who from the terror of this arm so late doubted his empire that were low indeed now give me leave to ask you a question do you really and bona fide believe that i pay idolatrous worship to sir isaac newton that i make him the object of that adoration which you say you will pay only to truth and which i will pay only to the god of truth and this because i apply to sir isaac newton a verse which an inferior poet applied to virgil is adorare vestigia to be literally taken think you what can be meant by these vestigia the mark of his foot in crane court or the truths discovered by him if the last to what purpose all this declamation and ridiculous rant about idolatry for four sections together   quo numine laeso you seem to dislike my professing that the highest honor i can ever arrive at or even desire is in any the lowest degree to imitate sir isaac newton s example you think it might have suited better with my appellation of philalethes and been altogether as laudable if my highest ambition had been to discover truth why so it is the discovering of truth and his clear candid humane way of making it known to mankind is the very thing in which i should desire to imitate sir isaac newton  you say i speak of it as a sort of crime to think it possible i should ever see farther or go beyond sir isaac newton but there are others who think it no crime to desire to know not only beyond sir isaac newton but beyond all mankind you intimate your self to be one of these now sir i am for seeing as much beyond sir isaac newton as you can be but first let us see as far as he has done i agree with you in this desire of knowledge make it as unbounded as you please i assure you i think it no crime the only difference between us is this you seem to think you have this knowledge already i am sensible i have it not  i make no doubt but such a man as you or one much inferior to you may carry a particular point or many particular points farther than sir isaac newton has done but that such a man as sir isaac newton after long consideration of one thing after touching and retouching it at different times for above half a century after setting it in several various lights after applying it in an infinite number of examples after giving several different demonstrations of it such as had satisfied all the mathematicians in europe should all this while have taken error for truth and given sophisms for demonstrations and thereby deceived all the world except my dear friend the author of the minute philosopher is what must be very clearly made out before i believe it   magnis tamen excidis ausis xvii you begin this section with addressing your self to me in the following manner i have said and i venture still to say that a fluxion is incomprehensible that second third and fourth fluxions are yet more incomprehensible that it is not possible to conceive a simple infinitesimal that it is yet less possible to conceive an infinitesimal of an infinitesimal and so onward what have you to say to this truly very little only i dont well comprehend how one incomprehensible can be more incomprehensible than another incomprehensible how it can possibly be less possible to conceive one thing than to conceive another thing which other thing it is not at all possible to conceive  for clearing up these assertions i have had recourse pursuant to your directions to the fourth section of the analyst which is the only one relating to fluxions of the three you refer me to but all the satisfaction i there meet with is that your imagination is very much strained and puzzled with one thing that it seems still more difficult to conceive another thing that a third seems an obscure mystery that a fourth exceeds if you mistake not all human understanding that take another in what light one pleases the clear conception of it will if you mistake not be found impossible this to me seems to amount to thus much the author of the minute philosopher cannot comprehend the principles of fluxions therefore no man living can comprehend them he cannot understand them therefore they exceed all human understanding a notable proof of my hypothesis that that gentleman has too good an opinion of himself and too mean a one of all other men  you go on addressing your self to me do you attempt to clear up the notion of a fluxion nothing like it very true nor did i ever undertake it sir isaac newton has done it incomparably well to those who are qualified to read his works and thither i refer you may not i expose your blunders without pretending to explain his doctrine better than he has done it himself  but you tell me i only assure you upon my bare word from my own experience and that of several others whom i could name that the doctrine of fluxions may be clearly conceived and distinctly comprehended why pray sir what did you require more you appealed to the trial of every thinking reader i am one of your thinking readers i have made the trial you desired i acquaint you with the result of that trial and all the return you make me is can you think i will take your word when i refuse to take your masters i appeal to all my thinking readers whether this be civil usage you say you dont understand fluxions i say i do i believe you and yet you will not believe me  this sir my judgment tells me is all the answer i ought to make to the invitations you so frequently give me upon this head i am sensible it were better to hold so slippery an adversary to the points we have already in hand than before these are settled to go upon new matter besides i am afraid of incurring the common fate of sir isaac newtons interpreters to be less intelligible than my master i apprehend likewise that let me take ever so much pains to satisfy and oblige you i shall meet with no better usage than when you appealed to me that all the return i am to expect is alas i find no sense or reason in what you say and yet i am so desirous of contributing my assistance toward your laudable design of putting this controversy in such a light as that every reader may judge thereof that i think i must run that hazard but i desire it may be remembered that i do not here intend nor indeed think my self at all qualified to write a complete treatise of fluxions that being expected from better hands all that you require of me is to show that the principles of fluxions may be clearly conceived this therefore is what i shall endeavor to do and in order to render those principles as intelligible as i can i shall make use of the plainest and easiest example possible that i may give my reader no other trouble than only that of comprehending the principles themselves  the foundation of the method of fluxions i take to be contained in the following  postulatum mathematical quantities may be described and in describing may be generated or destroyed may increase or decrease by a continued motion  definitions   a mathematical quantity increasing or decreasing by a continued motion is called a flowing quantity    the velocity with which such flowing quantity increases or decreases is called the fluxion of that flowing quantity    a part of such flowing quantity generated in a very small particle of time is called the augment or increment of the flowing quantity if the flowing quantity be increasing or its decrement if the flowing quantity be decreasing    a nascent increment is an increment just beginning to exist from nothing or just beginning to be generated but not yet arrived at any assignable magnitude how small soever an evanescent increment is the same thing as a nascent increment but only considered in a different manner as by a continual diminution becoming less than any assignable quantity and at last vanishing into nothing or ceasing to exist  explanation of the postulatum by an example if a point as a move in one direction from a to b with a continued motion it will describe and generate the right line ab and if the same point return from b to a it will describe and may thereby be supposed to destroy or annihilate the same right line ab  the definitions explained by the same example   while the generating point is in motion either way the line described by it is called a flowing line this flowing line perpetually increases while the generating point is moving in the direction ab and perpetually decreases while the generating point is moving in the direction ba    the velocity with which the generating point moves either way or the velocity with which the flowing line increases or decreases is called the fluxion of the flowing line ex gr the velocity of the generating point in c is called the fluxion of the flowing line ac and the velocity of the generating point in b is the fluxion of the flowing line ab    if in a very small particle of time the generating point move from c to c or from c to c the small line cc is in the first case called the increment of the flowing line ac and in the second case is called the decrement of the flowing line ac    when the generating point in describing the line ab is arrived at the point c and proceeds from thence toward b at the instant of time that it sets out or departs from the point c at that very instant of time an increment begins to be generated or begins to exist which therefore is properly called a nascent increment and as the generating point at that instant of time is supposed to be just setting out and not as yet to have moved to the least imaginable distance from the point c nor consequently to have generated the least imaginable increment it is plain that the nascent increment here considered will be less than any quantity that can be assigned  in like manner when the generating point returns back from c to c in order to annihilate the increment cc that increment will continually grow less and less will become less than any assignable quantity and will at last entirely vanish and become nothing by the return of the generating point to the point c at that instant of time therefore that the generating point returns to c at that very instant i say the increment vanishes and therefore is then properly called an evanescent increment  behold good reader the difficult the obscure the mysterious the incomprehensible principles of fluxions i am much mistaken if a little attention do not enable thee clearly to conceive them when thou have done this then will thou be rightly prepared for understanding the following fundamental proposition upon which sir isaac newton has established his method of fluxions the whole business of which method is from the proportion between the fluxions or between the nascent increments of flowing quantities to determine the proportion between the flowing quantities themselves and vice versa  proposition the fluxions or velocities of flowing quantities are very nearly as the increments of those flowing quantities generated in very small equal particles of time and they are exactly in the first proportion of the nascent increments or in the last proportion of the evanescent increments  demonstration   if the velocities are uniform it is plain that the increments generated in any equal times must be as those velocities    and if the velocities are not uniform but are perpetually changing yet in a very small particle of time their change will be very little and the increments will be very nearly the same as if the velocities were uniform i e the increments will be very nearly as the velocities with which they begin to be generated    and as the first ratio of the nascent increments must be the same whether the velocities be uniform or variable it follows that the nascent increments must be exactly as the velocities with which they begin to be generated q e d  here sir i must beg leave to observe to you that if sir isaac newton had proceeded no farther than the first part of this proposition and had contented himself with establishing the proportion between the increments and their velocities very nearly without going to the utmost exactness yet his method had been no less scientifical and no less demonstrative than it now is consequently you were very much overseen in charging him and his followers with proceeding blindfold and not knowing what they were doing even though you had succeeded in proving that his method did not come up to the rigor of geometry  to prevent cavils i must farther observe that the third part of this demonstration might easily be put into a more diffusive form and might be deduced step by step from the methodus rationum primarum and ultimarum but this at present is no way necessary especially as you admit the proposition to be true all that i have to do therefore is to explain it a little more particularly and this i shall be the more careful in doing because this proportion of nascent or evanescent increments is what i apprehend you are so often pleased to call a proportion between nothings with what justice you do so the reader may easily judge if he gives himself the trouble of considering what follows  in the first place and above all it is here to be diligently attended to that sir isaac newton no where settles or determines the magnitude of nascent or evanescent increments any farther than to say it is less than any finite magnitude on the contrary he expressly declares that their magnitude cannot be assigned or determined nor indeed has he any occasion to determine their magnitude but only the proportion between them this being all that is requisite in his method  now the proportion between two evanescent increments is easily to be conceived though the absolute magnitude of those increments is utterly imperceptible to the imagination for those increments may be expounded or represented by any two finite quantities bearing the same proportion to one another and as these finite quantities may be clearly conceived the proportion between them may likewise be clearly conceived i e the proportion of the evanescent increments may be clearly conceived by this means of this several examples may be found in sir isaacs methodus rationum primarum and ultimarum and one in imitation of him may be seen in this letter sect xxxii  this being premised i come now to illustrate and explain the proposition to which end i shall make use of the following easy example  let the right line abb divided into two equal parts in the point b revolve about the point a and with any continued motion even or uneven remove into the situation acc then will the points b and b describe the circular arcs bc bc the velocity of the point b will be always double of the velocity of the point b the arc bc will be double of the arc bc and the increment bd will be double of the increment bd in all this there is no difficulty between us  i say farther the nascent or evanescent increment of the arc bc is double of the nascent or evanescent increment of the arc bc this you will not understand i explain it thus beginning first with the nascent increments  as soon as the line abb begins to revolve upon the point a and thereby begins to depart from the situation abb at that instant of time do the points b and b begin to generate their several increments and as the velocity of the point b is always double of the velocity of the point b it is manifest that the increment of the arc bc begins to be generated with twice the velocity that the increment of the arc bc begins to be generated with ie that the nascent increment of bc is generated with twice the velocity that the nascent increment of bc is generated with and consequently that the former nascent increment is by this proposition double of the latter nascent increment  to come now to the evanescent increments let us suppose the line abb to have removed into the situation add very near to abb whereby the increments bd bd have been generated next let us imagine the line abd to return gradually to its first situation abb and thereby let the increments bd bd grow continually less and less and at last entirely vanish and become nothing then as the first of these two increments is double of the second and decreases twice as fast as the second it must perpetually bear the same proportion to the second and consequently the last proportion of these two increments their proportion at the instant of evanescence will be the same as at first namely that of   to   you tell me when they vanish they become nothing i allow it you say to talk of a proportion between nothings is to talk nonsense i agree with you but their last proportion is not their proportion after they are vanished and are become nothing it is their proportion when they vanish it is the proportion with which they vanish  you will tell me perhaps this is unintelligible i expect it i ask you therefore which vanishes first the increments themselves or the proportion between them i think sir even you will not venture to say that the increments vanish before their proportion vanishes or that the proportion vanishes before the increments vanish if so we are agreed thus far that the increments vanish and their proportion vanishes at one and the same instant of time this proportion therefore which vanishes at the same instant of time that the increments vanish is the proportion with which the increments vanish or in other words is the last proportion of the evanescent increments  this i hope will appear sufficiently clear to an attentive reader but for his farther satisfaction i shall beg leave to lay before him another example  let the point a with a given uniform velocity describe or generate the flowing line ab and let the point d with a velocity continually increasing describe or generate the flowing line de also let both points arrive at the line cf cutting the two flowing lines at the same instant of time and with velocities exactly equal  then it is plain that if we take two increments ff cc generated in the same particle of time ff will a little exceed cc but if we suppose the generating points to return toward the line cf and their respective velocities in every point of the increments ff cc to be the very same in returning as they had been before in proceeding from the line cf it is manifest that the more the increments are diminished by the gradual return of the generating points toward the line cf the nearer will the proportion between them approach to that of a perfect equality this is easily conceived and admits of no dispute  farther if the generating points be supposed to return exactly to the line cf and thereby by the increments vanish and become nothing the ratio with which the increments vanish into nothing or the last proportion of the evanescent increments will be that of a perfect equality for as during the time that the generating points are returning toward the line cf the increments ff cc are continually more and more diminished and the velocities with which the increments decrease approach more and more to the ratio of equality so at the instant of time that those points actually arrive at the line cf at that same instant the increments entirely vanish and at the very same instant the velocities with which they decrease and in decreasing vanish arrive at the ratio of perfect equality which therefore is the ratio of the velocities with which the increments vanish and consequently by this proposition is the ratio of the evanescent increments  it is to be carefully attended to that the proportion here given as the proportion of the evanescent increments is not their proportion before they vanish for then ff will exceed cc nor is it their proportion after they have vanished for then they are become nothing and  proportion but it is their proportion at the instant that they vanish or the proportion with which they vanish  i might observe farther that as the increments do not come to this proportion before they vanish so neither do they vanish before they come to this proportion but at one and the same instant of time they come to this proportion and vanish they vanish and come to this proportion but i am now afraid i have taken up too much of my readers time in explaining a point sufficiently clear before    xviii i am not of your opinion that every reader of common sense may judge as well of the principles of fluxions as the most profound mathematician how well the most profound mathematician can judge can i think be certainly known to the most profound mathematician only and i am sure i am not the man consequently i cannot take upon me to pronounce upon this point with the same assurance and certitude that you seem to do but this i well know that sir isaac newton did not write for every reader of common sense he wrote for mathematicians  nor can i agree with you that the simple apprehension of a thing defined is not sometimes at least made more perfect by any subsequent progress in mathematics it happened to me and i believe it happens to all or most other beginners in geometry that the definitions of an angle of a figure of parallel lines and of proportion all become clearer upon seeing the application of the things defined in different examples than upon only reading and considering those definitions with what care and attention soever  xix i will venture to say that you have taken as much pains as i sincerely believe any man living except a late philosopher of our university to make non sense of sir isaac newton s principles your success indeed has been equally bad with his but that is not your fault but your misfortune i must needs say you have done pretty well considering you never had a master in mathematics   neque ego tibi detrahere ausim haerentem capiti multa cum laud coronam xx i find by this section as well as by the eighteenth that you are perfectly well acquainted with what may or may not be done by any progress though ever so great in the analysis by the best of mathematicians by the most profound analyst such a man as you one would think might give one a little light into some very strange things i meet with toward the latter end of this section such as velocity without motion motion without extension magnitude which is neither finite nor infinite a quantity having no magnitude which is yet divisible a figure where there is no space proportion between nothings and a real product from nothing multiplied by something to me i must own these seem to be mysteries utterly incomprehensible but then i take them to be mysteries of your own making i can find no more sign of them in sir isaac newtons writings than of transubstantiation and some other mysteries in the new testament  xxi the picture you here draw is really a very ingenious portraiture but it has no manner of resemblance to sir isaac newton i should sooner have taken it for a picture of bellarmine or for a handsome likeness of the author of the minute philosopher drawing up an answer to philalethes a man driven to arts and shifts in order to defend his principles can hardly take them for true must entertain more than some doubt thereof for instance let any man breathing observe the arts and shifts you make use of throughout your answer and he will plainly see you are convinced of your being in an error but will not own it  xxii a new way of passing over a thing is never to have done with it the reader will easily judge who colors most is most clamorous reproaches most and reasons least  xxiii in the fourth section of the analyst instead of fairly giving sir isaac newtons plain easy intelligible definition of a second fluxion you are pleased to lay down three or four definitions of your own as obscure mysterious and absurd as you can possibly devise  eripiunt subito nubes coelumque diemque lectorum ex oculis after which you appeal to the trial of every thinking reader whether the clear conception of them is not impossible this i had taken notice of as a pious art of misleading and confounding your reader instead of instructing him and had put the two following questions to you which i shall here transcribe at large because with another pious art you have thought fit to truncate the one and to leave out the other for particular reasons which i shall by and by lay before the reader where said i do you find sir isaac newton using such expressions as the velocities of the velocities the second third and fourth velocities the incipient celerity of an incipient celerity the nascent augment of a nascent augment is this the true and genuine meaning of the words fluxionum mutationes magis aut minus celeres  to these two questions you are sensible it is incumbent upon you to seem to give an answer and you are likewise sensible you have none to give in this perplexity it is worthy the observation of a curious reader to see what arts and shifts a great genius may be driven to in grappling with an insuperable difficulty  in the first place you curtail my first question cutting off the latter part of it with an etc by this means you hide from your reader one of your definitions and that the least justifiable of them all namely the incipient celerity of an incipient celerity there is one difficulty cleverly got over  in the next place you entirely cut off my second question in which i find you have two advantages the first is to avoid giving an answer to it the second not to let your reader see sir isaac newtons definition which i had inserted into that question  but setting all this aside after you have proposed my question in your own manner what answer do you give to it do you show me where sir i n uses such expressions no you dont pretend to it what then why truly you endeavor to show by comparing together two independent passages taken from two different treatises of sir i n that you may justifiably call a second fluxion so and so be it so though i think otherwise yet still this will only show that a definition of your own may be used but will not show it to be sir isaac newtons definition nor to be equally clear with sir isaac newtons definition therefore the pious art i at first mentioned still subsists with the addition of two or three more pious arts to support it as it generally happens when such arts come to be examined into by any of our family of philalethes  in order to get out of this egyptian darkness in which you have studiously involved the matter in debate as well as to complete what i had begun in my seventeenth section toward clearing up the first principles of fluxions i shall now endeavor to give my reader and you too sir if you please a clear and intelligible conception not only of second but of third fourth and fifth fluxions etc ad infinitum upon the foot of sir isaac newtons definition of second fluxions  adspice namque omnem quae nunc obducta tuenti mortales visus hebetat tibi and humida circum caligat nubem eripiam that great man making use of the liberty which has always been allowed to inventors of giving new names to new conceptions and of defining those names as they thought fit has been pleased to call by the name of fluxion the velocity with which a flowing quantity increases or decreases if this velocity do not always continue the same but undergo any change the velocity of that change is called a fluxion of a fluxion or a second fluxion and as the change is swifter or slower the second fluxion is said to be greater or less for instance if the first fluxion or velocity of the flowing quantity continually increase the second fluxion is the velocity with which the first velocity increases and is proportional to the momentaneous increase of that first velocity  in like manner the third fluxion is the velocity of the change of the second fluxion the fourth fluxion is the velocity of the change of the third the fifth the velocity of the change of the fourth etc ad infinitum  here perhaps it may not be amiss to assist the readers imagination by representing the proportions between fluxions of all the several orders in a sensible manner i say their proportions for as i said before sir isaac newton makes no enquiry into nor ever considers the absolute magnitude of fluxions or moments or nascent increments but only the proportion between them and this i desire may be carefully remembered  a  a   f    f   f    f   f    f   f    f   let a be a flowing line and let the velocity with which it flows be always represented by the line   f then if the line a flow uniformly that is if the velocity with which it flows do never change or alter the line   f will be a constant quantity and the line a will have only a first fluxion and no second fluxion but if the line a flow with an accelerated velocity that is if the velocity with which it flows do continually increase the line   f will be a flowing line and the fluxion of this line   f or the velocity with which that line flows will be the fluxion of the fluxion   f or the second fluxion of the line a  now let the velocity with which this line   f flows be always represented by the line   f then if the line   f flow uniformly or the velocity with which it flows do never change or alter the line   f will be a constant quantity and the line   f will have only a first fluxion and no second fluxion and the line a will have a first and second fluxion but no third fluxion but if the line   f flow with an accelerated velocity or the velocity with which it flows do continually increase the line   f will be a flowing line and the fluxion of this line   f or the velocity with which it flows will be the fluxion of the fluxion   f or the second fluxion of the fluxion   f or the third fluxion of the line a and this fluxion or velocity may be represented by the line   f  in like manner   f may represent the first fluxion of   f the second fluxion of   f the third fluxion of   f and the fourth fluxion of the line a and it is visible that after this manner we may proceed ad infinitum  observing the same analogy let   f represent the first fluxion of the flowing line a   f the first fluxion of   f or the second fluxion of the line a   f the first fluxion of   f the second fluxion of   f or the third fluxion of a   f the first fluxion of   f the second fluxion of   f the third fluxion of   f or the fourth fluxion of a etc ad infinitum  then is it manifest that the proportion between the first fluxion of a and the first fluxion of a will be the same as that of the two finite lines   f and   f the proportion between the two second fluxions of a and a will be the same as that of the two finite lines   f and   f the proportion between the third fluxions will be that of the finite lines   f and   f the proportion of the fourth fluxions that of   f and   f etc to infinity  from this methinks it follows that second third and fourth fluxions are not more incomprehensible than a first fluxion  xxiv xxv xxvi i do not remember to have met with a greater instance of distingenuity and wilful misrepresentation in any controversy i have ever looked into than what the reader will observe to run through these three sections you had in the analyst charged the mathematicians with unjustly omitting a certain rectangle in their computation of the increment of the rectangle of two flowing quantities and thereupon had thought fit to represent them as not proceeding scientifically as not seeing their way distinctly as proceeding blindfold as arriving at the truth they know not how nor by what means with abundance of the like compliments plentifully dispersed all over the analyst  to this i had replied first that this omission at the worst could not cause them to deviate from the truth the least imaginable quantity in computing the most immense magnitude secondly that as they clearly saw and could plainly demonstrate this insignificancy of the omission they could not justly be said to proceed blindfold thirdly that this pretended error or omission of theirs was only a blunder of your own  in answer to this you spend three sections in endeavoring to make your reader believe that the main stress of my defense of sir isaac newton and his followers is that this error of theirs is of no significancy in practice without taking the least notice of the second part of my reply and barely mentioning the third upon this you declaim very abundantly in the style which the learned call the tautological  you tell me and it might have been sufficient once to have told me that the application in gross practice is not the point questioned i grant it is not why then have i said so much about the smallness of the error i will even tell you the plain truth though as you take notice i live in the university yet i have been in london too and am a little acquainted with the humor of the times and the characters of men now sir i had observed some of those gentlemen who are not greatly pleased that other persons should be possessed of any learning which they themselves have not to be not a little tickled with the rebuke that you had given to the pride of mathematicians i found them curious to know what this discovery was that was like to do so much service to the church i did my best to give them satisfaction and to let them see the greatness and importance of it they see it plainly and apply the old saying parturiunt montes  one of them indeed could make nothing of what i had said about the length of a subtangent or the magnitude of the orb of the fixed stars but was fully satisfied by the information given him by one of his acquaintance to the following effect the author of the minute philosopher has found out that if sir isaac newton were to measure the height of st pauls church by fluxions he would be out about three quarters of a hairs breadth but yonder is one philalethes at cambridge who pretends that sir isaac would not be out above the tenth part of a hairs breadth hearing this and that two books had been written in this controversy the honest gentleman flew into a great passion and after muttering something to himself about some bodys being overpaid he went on making reflections which i dont care to repeat as not being much for your honor or mine any more than for that of another person whom i too highly reverence to name upon this occasion  xxvii now gentle reader we come to the point you are to be shown the first instance of my courage in affirming with such undoubting assurance things so easily disproved my antagonist entreats you to observe how fairly i proceed i desire you to be upon your guard to look well about you after this if either of us endeavor to throw dust in your eyes knock him down whichsoever of us shall attempt to falsify the words of sir isaac newton or those of his opponent to the pump to the thames to the liffy with him pump him duck him for a pickpocket the dispute here is about a matter of fact and i will endeavor to state the case so plainly that it shall be impossible either to mistake or to evade it  in sir isaac newtons demonstration of the rule for finding the moment of the rectangle of two flowing quantities mention is made of three several rectangles to each of which the flowing rectangle is equal at three different times or in three different states  the first of these is the rectangle a a x b b  the second is the rectangle ab  the third is the rectangle a a x b b  i had observed sir that you were mistaken in taking it for granted that what sir isaac newton was endeavoring to find by the suppositions made in this demonstration was the increment of the second of these rectangles the rectangle ab the reason i gave for supposing you in a mistake was expressed in the following words for neither in the demonstration it self nor in any thing preceding or following it is any mention so much as once made of the increment of the rectangle ab this therefore is a matter of fact that you dispute with me but how you dispute it is worth observing it greatly imports you to contradict me and yet you cannot you dare not contradict what i say notwithstanding this you will contradict me methinks i see my reader stare i shall be taken for a madman and yet i speak the words of truth and soberness i affirm say you the direct contrary contrary to what to what i have said no you cannot you dare not do it your reader would immediately turn to sir isaac newton and detect you but you can first alter what i say and then contradict me instead of my words alone you can give the reader other words which are not mine and yet are so intermixed with mine and distinguished by inverted commas that every reader shall take them for mine and then you can affirm the direct contrary you cannot say sir isaac newton makes mention of the increment of the rectangle ab but you can affirm that he makes mention of the rectangle of such flowing quantities that he makes express mention of the increment of such rectangle of the increment of that rectangle whose sides have a and b for their incrementa tota that he understands his incrementum as belonging to the rectangulum quodvis you go on declaiming about the words the sense the context the conclusion of the demonstration and the thing to be demonstrated  involvere diem nubes nox humida coelum abstulit  and when the reader has lost all sight of the point in question you refer it to his own eyes  i refer it to him likewise and reply to all you have here said that the first of the three rectangles mentioned above namely the rectangle a a x b b is the rectangle of two flowing quantities but is not the rectangle ab is a rectangle whose sides have a and b for their incrementa tota but is not the rectangle ab is the rectangulum quodvis in its first state but still is not the rectangle ab the question is as your self declare about matter of fact it is not therefore about what sir isaac newton means but what he mentions not about what he understands but what he declares not about his sense but his words and in all his words throughout this demonstration and every thing preceding and following it i affirm and aver that he does not so much as once mention the increment of the rectangle ab deny it if you dare   vim duram and vincula capto tend doli circa haec demum frangenturinanes xxviii you tell me i would fain perplex this plain case by distinguishing between an increment and a moment but it is evident to every one who has any notion of demonstration that the incrementum in the conclusion must be the momentum in the lemma and to suppose it otherwise is no credit to the author now sir to show you how little i am inclined to perplex the case i hereby declare that i absolutely and fully agree with you that the incrementum in the conclusion is the momentum in the lemma let us now see whither this our agreement will lead us  the momentum in the lemma we both agree to be the momentum of the rectangle ab the incrementum in the conclusion is manifestly the excess of the rectangle a a x b b above the rectangle a a x b b ie the increment of the rectangle a a x b b therefore we are agreed that the moment of the rectangle ab is the increment of the rectangle a a x b b consequently you were mistaken in supposing that the moment of the rectangle ab was the increment of the same rectangle ab  you quote sir isaac newtons words against me to show that a moment is an increment or decrement why sir you make me stare did not i plainly tell you in my defense that the moment of ab was an increment did not i likewise tell you what increment it was namely the increment of a a x b b if you will be pleased to put on your mathematical spectacles or rather to put on the ingenuity of a scholar and a gentleman for your eyes are good enough you will plainly see that the distinction i make is not between a moment in general and an increment in general but between a particular moment and a particular increment between the moment of the rectangle ab and the increment of the rectangle ab ie the excess of the rectangle a a x b b above the rectangle ab  observe me well sir what i have affirmed and what i still affirm and what before i have done i shall prove past a possibility of being denied is this the moment of ab is neither the increment nor the decrement of ab neither the excess of a a x b b above ab nor the defect of a a x b b from ab this seems to you a wonderful assertion but one of yours which you call a very plain and easy one is to me much more wonderful  i asked which of these two quantities the increment of ab or the decrement of ab you would be pleased to call the moment of ab your answer is either of them this to me is a very wonderful answer for so great and so accurate a mathematician to make and if i have not quite forgot my logic i shall draw as wonderful an inference from it the moment of ab is equal to the increment of ab the same moment of ab is equal to the decrement of ab ergo the increment of ab is equal to the decrement of ab that is ab ba ab ab ba ab ie   ab o therefore the rectangle ab about which the author of the minute philosopher has made such a pother is by his own confession equal to nothing  your example in numbers does by no means come up to our case i shall beg leave to state it a little more pertinently it is agreed that all numbers are either odd or even upon this you pronounce an unknown number to be even without giving any reason for it i represent to you that since the number is unknown it may as well be odd as even and therefore to pronounce it either the one or the other without any reason for so doing is no better and no more like an arithmetician than to toss up cross or pile what you shall call it you may call this mirth if you please but the argument is not the less strong against you for this seeming levity  nor is the accommodation i proposed in the dispute between an increment and a decrement for the title of moment at all the less reasonable for being delivered in a ludicrous manner under which other persons can plainly discern a serious argument and i perceive you find it much easier to rally than to answer that argument to say truth there is no answer to be given to it it is a demonstration against you as strong as any in euclid that the moment of the rectangle ab is a middle arithmetical proportional between the increment and decrement of the same rectangle ab if so  ridentem dicere verum quid vetat xxix you are pleased to take notice that i very heartily represent my case to be that of an ass between two pottles of hay i find by this you are duly sensible of my candor had i been less candid you see plainly i had a fair occasion of representing another person in that perplexity who might not have had a ghost so ready at hand to help him out  the question with me was whether the velocity of the flowing rectangle ab was the velocity with which the increment or the velocity with which the decrement of the same rectangle ab might be generated i could see no possibility of a reason to determine me either way this led me to fix upon a middle arithmetical proportional between these two velocities for the velocity of the rectangle ab as i had before shown its moment to be a middle arithmetical proportional between the increment and decrement but you who talk so much of reasoning and logic and who set up for the great and sole master of the  geometrica are of opinion that either of these velocities may be deemed the velocity of the rectangle ab that is in your opinion of two unequal velocities either the one or the other may be deemed equal to a third velocity or two velocities may be deemed equal and unequal at the same time  you tell me for your part in the rectangle ab considered simply in itself without either increasing or diminishing you can conceive no velocity at all nor i neither but in the rectangle ab considered as flowing whether increasing or diminishing i can conceive some velocity or other and if it flow with an accelerated velocity i can conceive that velocity to be different in every point of time and if we suppose the increment of the rectangle to be generated in a given particle of time and the decrement of the same rectangle to be generated in another equal particle of time i can conceive the uniform velocity that would generate the increment in the given time to exceed the uniform velocity that would generate the decrement in the same time and these two velocities being unequal i can conceive an arithmetical mean between them in like manner as i had before supposed an arithmetical mean between the increment and decrement of ab which mean is the moment of ab and lastly while ab flows i can conceive that the first arithmetical mean is constantly proportional to the last ie that the velocity of ab is proportional to the moment of ab  upon my asserting that the moment of the rectangle ab is neither the increment nor decrement of that same rectangle ab you tell me this is in direct opposition to what sir isaac himself has asserted in a passage you quote from him and you bid the reader not believe you but believe his eyes now certainly would any reasonable man that did not thoroughly know the author of the minute philosopher conclude that i denied what is expressed in the passage here quoted against me viz that moments are either increments or decrements that increments are affirmative moments and decrements are negative moments little would any one imagine from the assurance with which you here express yourself that all i maintain is as i said a while ago that one particular determined moment is not one particular determined increment but your chicaneries are so many so gross and every way so shameful for a scholar a gentleman and above all for one professing piety and christian zeal that i grow weary of exposing and refuting them i solemnly aver that after i have detected so many almost in every paragraph of your reply i have knowingly and voluntarily passed by many more particularly those scandalous ones of almost perpetually changing the words i use for others that seem to make more for your advantage one would think your aim was to show that whatever care can be used in expression it shall be no fence against such an adversary as you  xxx you entreat me in the name of truth to tell what this moment is which is acquired which is lost which is cut in two or distinguished into halves is it say you a finite quantity or an infinitesimal or a mere limit or nothing at all you go on to make objections to every one of those senses if i take it in either of the two former you say i contradict sir isaac newton very true if in either of the latter i contradict common sense very true again but what then can i take it in no other sense but those four you propose i assure you i never had a thought of taking it in any one of those senses  but in the name of falsehood what is the meaning of this question would you have me tell you what a moment is or what the magnitude of a moment is if the former i tell you what sir isaac newton has told you before a moment is a momentaneous or nascent increment proportional to the velocity of the flowing quantity if the latter i have no business at all to consider the magnitude of a moment princ lib    lemm   neque enim spectatur says sir isaac newton magnitudo momentorum sed prima nascentium proportio i may tell you farther that the magnitude of a moment is nothing fixed nor determinate is a quantity perpetually fleeting and altering till it vanishes into nothing in short that it is utterly unassignable princ lib   sect   schol dantur ultimae quantitatum evanescentium rations non dantur ultimae magnitudines  you seem much at a loss to conceive how a nascent increment a quantity just beginning to exist but not yet arrived to any assignable magnitude can be divided or distinguished into two equal parts now to me there appears no more difficulty in conceiving this than in apprehending how any finite quantity is divided or distinguished into halves for nascent quantities may bear all imaginable proportions to one another as well as finite quantities one example of this i have already given in sect    p    where the nascent increments bd bd bear to each other the proportion of   to   and consequently the nascent increment bd is equal to one half of the nascent increment bd and by dividing the revolving line abb into any other assignable parts it is very easy to conceive what number one pleases of nascent increments bearing any assignable proportions to one another  it is possible you may be so exceedingly scrupulous as to object that though a moment as bd is here shown to be equal to half of another moment bd yet still this does not come up to the case of sir isaac newtons demonstration where one moment is supposed not only to be double of another as in this case but to be actually divided into two equal parts i am willing to have all possible regard for the tenderness and delicacy of your understanding in conceiving any thing that makes against you and therefore shall readily you give the best assistance i can toward overcoming this difficulty likewise and perhaps it may be most easy to your imagination if we first suppose our moments to be finite quantities and afterward to become evanescent as sir isaac newton generally does and observes to be agreeable to the geometry of the ancients  let therefore the line ac be bisected in the point b and at a given instant of time let a point set out from a to describe the line ac with any given velocity it is plain this point will arrive at c in a given time let another point at the same given instant of time set out from b with one half of the former velocity to describe the line bc then will this second point arrive at c in the same given time as the first point will arrive there now let us suppose the lines ac bc to be gradually destroyed by this motion of their respective describing points a and b it is manifest that these lines will be to one another as   to   not only at the first but all the time they are diminishing and as by the approach of the points a and b to the point c these lines will be diminished sine fine and will at last vanish into nothing by the actual arrival of those points at c the proportion beforesaid of   to   will still subsist between them to the instant of their evanescence and even at that very instant here then we have the evanescent line ab actually divided into two equal parts as was above proposed for this division does not cease before the line vanishes any more than the line vanishes before the division ceases the whole line ac does not vanish before its half bc nor the half bc before the whole ac but the whole line ac and the half line bc vanish at one and the same instant of time  i am satisfied that what i have here laid before you in order to assist you in conceiving an evanescent quantity distinguished into two equal parts will be of little use unless i clear up the rest of those strange conceits if words without a meaning may be called so which you say i utter with that extreme satisfaction and complacency that unintelligible account in which you find no sense or reason and bid the reader find it if he can  and here i own you have fairly gravelled me i am at a stand at a loss in as great a perplexity as when my hunger was equally divided between the two bottles of hay without seeing any possibility of its being satisfied oh for a whisper from another ghost but alas what would even that avail me against a freethinker in mathematics against a man so hardened in infidelity that he will not believe though one should arise from the dead not upon the word of a ghost how venerable soever what then can be done i had i thought rendered that account as clear as words could make it i had shown not only what a moment was but to prevent as far as possible all mistakes about it i had most carefully and circumspectly shown what it was not since that account was published i had observed several persons to be greatly satisfied with that paragraph and some to have rectified their notions by it what then can be the reason of this phenomenon that the perspicacious author of the minute philosopher cannot comprehend what every body else so easily understands cannot see what to others appears as clear as the day is it that he has hurt his sight by poring so long upon objects too small to be discerned as a triangle in a point or has he blinded himself by gazing upon a light too strong for his eyes with endeavoring to find spots in the sun or has he cracked his brain by his meditations upon a science too hard for an essay on vision sect cliii to clix angel hark is not that he exclaiming yonder  o thou that with surpassing glory crowned look from thy sole dominion like the author of this new method at whose sight the sages hang their unfurnished heads to thee i call but with no friendly voice and add thy name isaac to tell thee how i hate thy wreaths that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell elated far above thy sphere till pride and lust of me threw me down warring in vain against thee matchless knight ah wherefore he deserved no such return from me twas he that taught me all i knew of fluents moments and of increments nascent or evanescent with his science upbraiding none nor were his fluxions hard bless us how the poor gentleman raves hush he begins again  o then at last relent is there no place left for repentance none for pardon left none left but recantation and that word disdain forbids me and my dread of shame amongst aarons lordly sons whom i deluded with other promises and other vaunts than to recant boasting i could subdue the analysts ay me they little know how dearly i abide that boast so vain under what torments inwardly i groan while brs adore me on the thre of cl with me and with crr high advanced but hold these circumstances surely can never suit my correspondent and besides i remember he abominates the very sound of miltonick verse i must certainly be mistaken  is it then that by having been long in the dark and fixing his attention upon dim and obscure objects which he had not light enough to perceive distinctly his pupil is so dilated as not to be able to distinguish things in open day i was going to say like a cat that had lost her membrana nictitans but perhaps this comparison though with so sagacious an animal may give him offense what then shall i say i have it i beg his pardon for these offensive guesses it was my own fault i was not understood by him this comes of saving sixpence to ones reader had i put a figure in that place all had been right but i was resolved to have none for i knew my bookseller who understands his business as well as jacob tonson would not have failed of clapping on the other sixpence to the price of my performance which would have disappointed me in my design of making truth come cheaper than error but it will be asked why the want of a figure to that account should be of greater disadvantage to him than to other readers i answer this proceeds from an infirmity that i have long observed in him though every body may not have taken notice of it and though it is as i believe unknown to himself it is that his ideas are almost all sensible he has few or none of those ideas which are purely or partly intellectual and which have no sensible images to represent them but of this disease i may perhaps speak more largely another time at present i shall endeavor to obviate this defect in him by the following figure  let therefore ralb or rl represent the flowing rectangle ab in sir isaac newtons demonstration ra the side a and rb the side b ei ia ao and ou each one half of a and bc cb bd and df each one half of b and complete the rectangles erbq ircr ords urft  then will the rectangle a a x b b be represented by the rectangle rr the rectangle a a x b b by the rectangle rs and the difference between these two rectangles or the moment of the rectangle ab or rl will be represented by the gnomon rs lying partly within and partly without the rectangle rl  the rectangle a a x b b will be represented by rq and the difference between this rectangle and the rectangle ab or the decrement of ab will be represented by the gnomon lq lying within the rectangle rl  likewise the rectangle a a x b b will be represented by rt and the difference between this rectangle and the rectangle ab or the increment of ab will be represented by the gnomon lt lying without the rectangle rl  let us now see if by the help of this figure my unintelligible account of a moment can be cleared up  first then the moment of the rectangle ab or rl is neither the increment from ab to a a x b b nor the decrement from ab to a a x b b ie rs is neither lt nor lq  it is not a moment common to ab and a a x b b which may be considered as the increment of the former or as the decrement of the latter i e rs is not lt common to rl and rt which may be considered as the increment of rl or as the decrement of rt  nor is it a moment common to ab and a a x b b which may be considered as the decrement of the first or as the increment of the last ie rs is not lq common to rl and rq which may be considered as the decrement of rl or as the increment of rq  but it is the moment of the very individual rectangle ab itself and peculiar to that only and such as being considered indifferently either as an increment or decrement shall be exactly and perfectly the same ie rs is the moment of rl and peculiar only to rl and if rl be considered as an increasing quantity rs may be considered as an increment if rl be looked upon as decreasing rs may be considered as a decrement but whether rs be considered as increment or decrement of rl it is one and the same quantity  and the way to obtain such a moment  viz such as being considered either as an increment or decrement of the rectangle rl shall be exactly the same such as is not common to rl and some other rectangle but peculiar to rl only is not to look for a moment lying between ab and a a x b b ie between rl and rt nor to look for one lying between ab and a a x b b ie between rl and rq not to suppose ab as lying at either extremity of the moment but as extended to the middle of it ie not to suppose lt to be the moment and rl lying at the inner extremity of it nor to suppose lq to be the moment and rl lying at the outer extremity of it but to suppose rs to be the moment and rl extended to the middle of it as having acquired rl the one half of the moment and being about to acquire the other half ls or as having lost ls the one half of the moment and being about to lose the other half lr  i hope by this time sir you may have discovered some sense and reason in what i say in my account of a moment but if you cannot or will not discover any i flatter myself the reader both will and can and having now a figure before me i shall take the opportunity of showing you that there is some reasoning couched under what you are pleased to take for mirth and humor in the proof that i have given page       of my defense that the moment of the rectangle ab is not the increment or decrement of ab but a middle arithmetical proportional between them  after proposing to you what by your own confession is the increment and what the decrement of the rectangle ab i ask you say with an intention to puzzle you which of these you will call the moment of ab i supposed it impossible for you to give any answer to that question and therefore i decided it my own way you now say either of them and you call this a plain and easy answer my question was what is the moment of the rectangle rl you answer either lt or lq i ask again how can i take either lt or lq for the moment of rl when lt and lq are unequal if the moment be equal to lt then must lq be less than the moment and if the moment be equal to lq then must lt be greater than the moment which then must i take for the moment since each of them can never be equal to the moment all the answer i can get out of you is either of them  things standing thus i offer this argument to your consideration since according to you i may take lt for the moment of rl and since according to you i may likewise take lq for the moment of rl it is manifest that according to you i may take lt and lq added together for twice the moment of rl consequently according to you i may take the half of lt and the half of lq added together for the moment of rl ie i may take rs for the moment of rl i hope i may now be allowed to say believe me there is no remedy you must acquiesce   frustra cerno te tendere contra i suppose sir you may now comprehend my meaning when i say that the moment of ab is not the increment of ab though i allow the moment of ab to be an increment agreeably to sir isaac newtons definition of the word moment but still it is possible you may doubt whether the sense i assign to the word moment be sir isaac newtons sense of that term or a new one that i have affixed to it in opposition to you this is the next point to be cleared up  and here i beg leave to observe in the first place the presumption is strong in my favor that by the moment of ab sir isaac means something different from the increment of ab for if these two words signified precisely the same thing it is probable he would have used them indifferently sometimes the one and sometimes the other whereas the fact is that after he has done with defining his terms he never mentions the word increment but in one place and then he does not speak of the increment of the rectangle ab but only of the increment of the rectangle ie of the flowing rectangle taken at large but where he names his rectangle or other flowing quantity as ab abc a  a  etc he never mentions the increment of ab of abc of a  etc but always the moment of ab the moment of abc the moment of a  of a  etc and when such a writer as sir isaac newton chooses constantly to use one term rather than another seemingly of the same signification it is to be presmed he has some reason for so doing  but farther we are to take notice that according to sir isaac newton the moment of a flowing quantity is ever proportional to the velocity of the same flowing quantity let the velocity and the moment of a flowing quantity vary as they will yet if any instant of time be taken these three things will be given such as they are at that same instant namely the rectangle itself its velocity and its moment and this velocity and moment are always proportional if therefore it shall be shown that the moment of a flowing quantity such as i suppose it is proportional to the velocity of that same flowing quantity it will follow that what i suppose to be the moment is the same with the moment intended by sir isaac newton  in order therefore to render the conception of this point as easy and as clear as possible i shall once more have recourse to that well known and familiar instance of a flowing quantity i have so often made use of viz that of a line described by the motion of a point  let x represent the time in which a flowing line is generated in all the following cases and since time flows uniformly let the constant quantity x represent the moment or increment for in this particular case they are both one of the time x  case   if the velocity of the generating point be uniform the flowing line will be as the time in which it is generated and consequently the line may also be represented by x and its moment or increment may be represented by x in this case therefore the moment x being constant must be proportional to the velocity which is likewise constant  case   let the velocity be equably accelerated as in the case of a falling body according to galileos theory then will the velocity be as the time and consequently the velocity likewise may be represented by x and the flowing line being as the time and velocity jointly that line may be represented by x  now the supposed moment of this line x  is   xx and i say   xx is proportional to x the velocity of the flowing line for since x is a constant quantity it is evident that   xx is as   x and   x is as x therefore   xx is as x in this case therefore the supposed moment is as the velocity of the flowing quantity  case   let the velocity be as the square of the time and be represented by x  then will the flowing line still be as the velocity and the time jointly and consequently may be represented by x  the supposed moment of which viz   x  x is evidently as x  or as the velocity  case   in general let the velocity be as any power of the time and consequently be represented by x n  then may the flowing line be represented by the time and the velocity jointly or by x x x n  ie by x n and the supposed moment of this line will be nx n  x which is manifestly as x n  that is as the velocity  the moment therefore supposed by me is ever proportional to the velocity and consequently is the moment supposed by sir isaac newton  while i am upon this consideration it may not be amiss for a more complete illustration of what we have been talking of to consider a little more particularly the second case or that of the flowing quantity x  answering to the rectangle ab of sir isaac newton i shall therefore take the liberty of laying before my reader in one view the decrement the moment and the increment of the flowing quantity x  together with the several velocities that would generate them respectively with an uniform motion in a given time  the decrement moment increment   xx xx   xx   xx xx velocity velocity velocity x x  x x x   here it appears that as the moment is a middle arithmetical proportional between the decrement and increment so is the velocity of the flowing line or the velocity that would generate the moment in the given time   x a middle arithmetical proportional between the velocities that would respectively generate the decrement and increment in the same given time and this proportion equally holds whether the moments be evanescent or finite quantities of whatsoever magnitude  whence i infer that although it were not possible to conceive an evanescent moment divided into two equal parts yet as finite ones may be conceived to be so divided that demonstration of sir isaac newtons which you object against will still hold firm and entire by substituting finite moments in the room of evanescent moments which is a secret you were not aware of  one more observation and i have done you would have us take the increment of ab or in this case the increment of x  for the moment of x  that is you would have us take   xx xx and not   xx for the moment of x  and yet you allow that the moment of x  is proportional to the velocity of x  but the velocity of x  is x and the quantity you give us as the moment namely   xx xx is not proportional to this velocity x therefore by your own concession that quantity is not the true moment but the quantity that sir isaac newton assigns namely   xx has just now been shown to be proportional to x the velocity of x  and therefore is the true moment now therefore i may safely repeat my question and ask with my accustomed air what say you sir is this a just and legitimate reason for sir isaacs proceeding as he did i think you must acknowledge it to be so  but hark you why all this outcry about ghosts and visions pray who first introduced them if i brought in one you might consider it was to a very good purpose to help my self out or rather to help you out at a dead lift whereas you had before needlessly introduced an innumerable multitude of ghosts of departed quantities for no other intent or purpose in the world but your own diversion  in consideration of which i hope i may be pardoned for bringing in one more though i can give no better reason for it than that the apparition runs strongly in my fancy  see where the phantom comes a sable wand before his decent steps of regal port but faded splendor wan his flowing hair circled with golden tiar a gorgeous vest dyed meliboean from his shoulders broad hangs graceful down in sable armor clad sable his body but in whitest mail his sinewy arms refulgent such the bird majestic treads the albent cliffs or wings the air roystonian passion dims his face thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair his gestures fierce and mad demeanor mark his form disfigured more than can befall spirit of happy sort for heavenly minds from such distempers foul are ever clear the thought both of lost fame and lasting scorn torments him round he throws his baleful eyes that witness huge affliction and dismay mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate and breaking silence horrid thus begins fallen from what height so much the stronger proved he with his moments and till then who knew the force of these dire arms yet not for those nor what the potent victor in his rage can else inflict do i repent or change though changed in outward luster that fixed mind and high disdain from sense of selfweighd merit that with proud newton raised me to contend and shook his throne what though the field be lost all is not lost thunconquerable will and study of revenge immortal hate and courage never to submit or yield as at the head of battle still defies him undaunted since by fate the wings of ganders and sepia sableblooded cannot fail so spoke thapostate analyst though in pain vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair frowning he ended and his look denounced desperate revenge and battle dangerous to less than philalethes when upstood one next himself in crime in strength superior nisroc of principalities the prime and to that eminence by merit raised nisroc the strongest and the fiercest spirit that fought in this bad cause the strongest far the fiercest once now broken with despair his trust was with great isaac to be deemed a match in strength and rather than be less cared not to be at all grown humbler now as one he stood escaped from cruel fight sore toiled his riven arms to havoc hewn mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail clouded his brow deep on his front engraven sat meditation silent in his eye shone piercing contemplation thought profound and princely counsel in his face yet shone majestic though in ruin sage he stood with atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of loftiest theories his look drew audience and attention still as night or summers noontide air while thus he spoke o prince o chief of many wronghead powers that led the imbattled increments to war under thy conduct and with dreadful blunders brainless endangered newton s deathless fame and put to proof his high supremacy by chance upheld or science and that strife was not inglorious though the event was dire the dire event too well i see and rue that with sad overthrow and foul defeat has lost thy fame and all this muddy host in horrible destruction laid thus low as far as ghosts and shadowy entities can perish the vision would lead me a great deal farther and i might proceed to relate in heroic verse the rebuke given by the fallen chief to this his associate for pusillanimity in abandoning the noble undertaking  if thou be he but o how fallen how changed from him from that sworn friend whom mutual league united thoughts and counsels equal hope and hazard in the glorious enterprise joined with me once now misery has joined in equal ruin  but i am afraid sir you begin to be tired possibly this vision of mine may give you as little pleasure as the ghosts you introduced some time ago afforded to any of your readers i shall therefore stop here and hope from your known candor that if you chance to spy any inconsistencies or any little marks of vanity in this my vision you will be so just as to consider there are but few visions apparitions dreams or castles built in the air that are not liable to some objection  xxxi it is now so evident even to your self that the moment of the rectangle ab is not the increment of the rectangle ab that i expect to be complimented upon my civility in charging you with want of caution only in putting the one for the other you have indeed replied that this charge is as untrue as it is peremptory but that was in your state of blindness and i forgive you without your asking pardon you say in your justification sir isaac newton in the first case of this lemma expressly determines it to be an increment yes he determines it to be an increment but an increment of what an increment of ab methinks i see the good old knight hold up his finger and cry cave it is the increment of a a x b b  you say take it increment or decrement as you will the objections still lie and the difficulties are equally insuperable very true but i will not take it for either increment or decrement and then all difficulties and objections vanish before me they become nothing there are no difficulties no objections i meet with nothing in my way but the ghosts of departed difficulties and objections  xxxii before i proceed to vindicate that assertion of mine which makes the subject of this section i crave leave to observe that this assertion true or false is no way material to the point in debate between us you were fully answered before i laid down that assertion and all the subterfuges you have since made use of are clearly removed before i vindicate it why therefore did i make that assertion dear sir the true reason is a secret i see plainly it never entered your pericranium any more than that of some other persons much superior to you in this part of science in due time it may come out in the mean while all i shall say is it was made to guard not against present but future objections  do not mistake me sir i am not going to excuse that assertion much less to give it up i intend to vindicate it to the last drop of my pen like mackbeth in blood   i am in ink stepped in so far that should i wade no more returning were as tedious as go over my assertion was that the moment of the rectangle ab determined by sir isaac newton namely ab ba and the increment of the same rectangle determined by your self namely ab ba ab are perfectly and exactly equal supposing a and b to be diminished ad infinitum and this by lemma   sect   libr   princip  you answer if a and b are real quantities then ab is something and consequently makes a real difference but if they are nothing then the rectangles whereof they are coefficients become nothing likewise and consequently the momentum or incrementum whether sir isaac s or mine are in that case nothing at all  by giving this for an answer to my assertion it is plain you have no notion of what sir isaac newton means by a quantity being infinitely diminished though he has so fully and clearly explained himself in the scholium of that section of the principia which i so often refer you to  suppose a given line to be gradually diminished during a given time by the continued motion of a point so that at the end of the given time the line would entirely vanish and become nothing then if the motion of the point and the gradual diminution of the line consequent thereupon be supposed to stop before the expiration of the given time it is plain that the line will not as yet have been diminished ad infinitum it will still be something it will be a real quantity it will be a finite quantity but if the motion go on without stop or stay to the end of the given time it is manifest that the line must be diminished sine fine sine limite it must be diminished ad infinitum it must vanish it must become nothing the end of this diminution ad infinitum the vanishing of the line and its becoming nothing these three must all happen at one and the same instant of time namely at the expiration of the given time so that an instant before the expiration of the given time or before the quantity becomes nothing it cannot truly be said to be actually diminished ad infinitum therefore while a and b are real quantities they are not yet diminished ad infinitum they may be farther diminished and consequently the first part of your answer is quite beside the purpose it tends only to show that there is a real difference between the moment and increment before the instant of time when i suppose them to become equal that while they are unequal there is a difference between them a great discovery and undoubtedly true  you proceed in your answer if they ie a and b are nothing then the rectangles whereof they are coefficients become nothing likewise and consequently the momentum or incrementum whether sir isaac s or mine are in that case nothing at all  this likewise is undoubtedly true but it is so far from contradicting sir isaac newtons doctrine that it is perfectly agreeable to it what he says and what i contend for is this  though so long as a and b are real quantities their rectangle ab is a real quantity and there is a real difference between the two quantities ab ba and ab ba ab yet when by a continual diminution ad infinitum a and b vanish their rectangle ab or the difference between the two quantities ab ba and ab ba ab vanishes likewise and there is no longer any difference left between those quantities ie those quantities are equal but you say when ab when the difference between these two quantities vanishes the quantities themselves do likewise vanish i agree with you their difference therefore vanishes when they vanish and they vanish when their difference vanishes or the quantities themselves and the difference between them vanish at one and the same instant of time  you see i agree perfectly with you that the moment and increment vanish at the same instant that their difference vanishes all i contend for is this that the moment and increment vanish with a ratio of equality and that they do so i am going to demonstrate after sir isaac newtons manner  let the rectangle ae represent   xx the moment and let the rectangle af represent   xx xx the increment of the flowing square x  i say when x vanishes the moment   xx and the increment   xx xx will vanish with a ratio of equality  demonstration produce the lines ad be cf to the distant points d e f and draw the right line def parallel to def then will the rectangles ae af be proportional to the rectangles ae af now let cb be diminished ad infinitum and vanish into nothing by the coincidence of the point c with the point b at the instant that these points coincide the lines cff be will likewise coincide ie the rectangles ae af will coincide and become perfectly equal and at the same instant the rectangles ae af ie the moment and increment will vanish but at the instant that the rectangles ae af become equal the rectangles proportional to these ae and af must likewise become equal therefore these rectangles vanish and become equal at one and the same instant of time or vanish with a ratio of equality qed  i am so desirous of leaving both you sir and my reader without any scruple upon this point that i cannot content myself with only demonstrating that in fact the thing is as i say unless i likewise show you by what means it comes to be so the case is this  while x is gradually diminished the ratio between the increment and moment is likewise perpetually diminished and tends to a certain limit which it can never pass and can never arrive at till x is diminished ad infinitum and vanishes into nothing that limit is equality  likewise while x is gradually diminished the increment and moment are perpetually diminished and tend to a certain limit which they can never arrive at till x is diminished ad infinitum and vanishes into nothing that limit is nothing  so that the ratio of the increment and moment and the increment and moment do both arrive at their several limits ie at equality and at nothing at one and the same instant of time that is the increment and moment become equal and vanish vanish and become equal at the same instant  methinks sir you and i are now so far agreed that it is pity there should be any difference between us about the lemma i quoted to you but as it may be of some service to you and may possibly save trouble to us both another time i am willing to take a little farther pains for your information though i greatly fear it will be lost upon you and that you will make no better use of it than you did of the friendly advice i gave you in my last letter to weight very well what sir isaac newton says before you censure him for i see my hypothesis about the cause of your errors still holds good you have too good an opinion of your own understanding to think you can ever be mistaken else how was it possible for you to say when such a man as sir isaac newton was laying down the foundation of the method of fluxions that his very first and fundamental lemma was incompatible with and subversive of the doctrine of fluxions that it seemed the most injudicious step that could be taken that it was directly demolishing the very doctrine i would defend pray let us see what this lemma is  lemma i quantitates ut and quantitatum rations quae ad aequalitatem tempore quovis finito constanter tendunt and ante finem temporis illius propius ad invicem accedunt quam pro data quavis differentia fiunt ultimo aequales  in this lemma are manifestly contained the following suppositions   that the quantities or ratios of quantities tend to equality   that this tendency to equality constantly holds during a given time   that they come nearer to equality than to have any assignable difference between them   that they come thus near to equality before the expiration of the given time   upon these suppositions sir isaac affirms and demonstrates that the quantities do at last become equal ie do become equal at the end of the given time  we come now to see what you object to this you i say who have long since consulted and considered this lemma you who very much doubt whether i have sufficiently considered this lemma its demonstration and its consequences you who have taken as much pains as you sincerely believe any man living to understand that great author and to make sense of his principles you on whose part you assure me no industry nor caution nor attention have been wanting so that if you do not understand him it is not your fault but your misfortune i am going to take my candle and lanthorn as harlequin did a while ago at paris to look for the complete victory at parma and shall make a diligent search after your industry caution and attention in considering this short lemma it certainly deserves all the caution you can use since it contains according to sir isaac newton the foundation not only of the method of fluxions but of the principia themselves of that book which is the admiration and astonishment of all mankind except the author of that greater and more stupendous work the minute philosopher  you suppose sir isaac newton to argue that quantities must be equal because they have no assignable difference is this then the only supposition he makes that quantities have no assignable difference does he not plainly make the first the second and fourth supposition abovementioned as well as the third are the following words ad aequalitatem tempore quovis finito constanter tendunt and ante finem temporis illius left out of your copy if not where were your eyes that you overlooked them or your integrity that you suppressed them might not the most orthodox father of the church or the great apostle st paul himself be proved an errant heretic by such a proceeding for shame go and look over that lemma again read it diligently consider it thoroughly understand it if you can and till you have done so never dare to take the venerable name of sir isaac newton within your lips much less to condemn him  xxxiii we come now to the method for obtaining a rule to find the fluxion of any power of a flowing quantity which is delivered in the introduction to the quadratures and considered in the analyst and here say you the question between us is whether i have rightly represented the sense of those words evanescant jam augmenta illa in rendering them let the increments vanish ie let the increments be nothing or let there be no increments and so sir you would have the reader believe that this is the whole of the question between us that we have each of us spent four or five pages and may possibly spend twice as many more before we have done in wrangling about the translation of four latin words if so methinks his best way will be to let us wrangle by our selves and to translate those four words himself as he thinks fit without ever troubling his head about us  but i take the question between us to be of a little more extent and of somewhat more importance what i have endeavored to establish the sense of is not those four words alone but the whole passage taken together ie in the style of divines the text and the context the whole passage is evanescant jam augmenta illa and eorum ratio ultima erit and i have endeavored to settle the meaning of this whole passage taken together by comparing it with an equivalent passage but expressed in such terms as not to be liable to any sophistication nascantur jam augmenta illa and eorum ratio prima erit  the question therefore between us is not barely how those four words may be translated if they stood alone they might be translated twenty different ways but the question is how these four words ought to be translated in conjunction with the other words that follow how the whole passage ought to be translated so as to let the reader understand the meaning and design of sir isaac newton in that passage his design is manifestly to consider the proportion between the evanescent augments or to consider the proportion with which the augments vanish he plainly makes two suppositions in this passage the first is that the augments vanish or become nothing the second that the augments have a last ratio and his business is to determine what this last ratio is now the question between you and me is when at what instant of time sir isaac newton supposes the augments to have this last ratio you will needs have it that he supposes the augments first to vanish to become nothing and then considers the proportion between those nothings i maintain that he considers the proportion between the augments not after they are vanished but at the instant that they vanish in the very point of evanescence and i am justified by his own words where he more fully explains himself schol sect   libr   princip intelligendam esse rationem quantitatum non antequam evanescutn non postea sed quacum evanescunt you see therefore sir the hard words you say i have used do not fall upon my friends but fall where i intended them the blunder of making the quantities first become nothing and then settling the proportion between those nothings stands just as it did it puts me in mind of an evidence who was instructed to swear that a certain will was made just as the testator was dying and was therefore subsequent to another will made some time before his death this person resolved to make sure work and swore positively that this was the last will for it was made after the testator was dead  you see likewise you had no reason to despair of making me acknowledge that vanishing and becoming nothing were equivalent terms with sir isaac newton indeed how was it possible to think otherwise a nascent augment must have been nothing before it began to exist and an evanescent augment must be nothing after it ceases to exist  as it is my business chiefly to keep upon the defensive and i have hitherto had very little occasion to act offensively i did in my first letter consider your important lemma and reasoning upon it no farther than was necessary to justify sir isaac newton against the consequences you draw from that lemma but now as you are pleased to show more than ordinary arrogance in this and the following section i hope the reader will excuse me if i step out of my way to call you a little to account a vigilant general who is assaulted in his entrenchments by an overbearing and insolent enemy may sometimes observe that enemy in the heat of his attack to lay himself so open as to give a fair opportunity of sallying out and chastising him  and it may not be amiss to show that mathematicians are not the only persons who falsely imagine their rational faculties to be more improved than those of other men which have been exercised in a different manner and on different subjects that there are other persons who erect themselves into judges and oracles concerning matters which they have never sufficiently considered nor comprehended and if this appear it will surely furnish a fair argumentum ad hominem against men who reject that very thing in geometry which they admit in logic it will be a proper way to abate the pride and discredit the pretensions of these logicians and metaphysicians who insist upon clear ideas in points of mathematics if it be shown that they do without them in their own science  the substance of your lemma is this if one supposition be made and be afterward destroyed by a contrary supposition then every thing that followed from the first supposition is destroyed with it this being laid down you proceed thus sir isaac newton supposes certain increments to exist or that there are certain increments in consequence of their supposed existence he forms certain expressions of those increments with intent to deduce the proportion of the increments from those expressions he afterward supposes that those increments vanish ie say you that the increments are nothing that there are no increments  i forbear making any remarks upon your interpretation of the word vanish i admit it to be as you are pleased to make it that the first supposition is there are increments and that the second supposition is there are no increments what do you infer from this the second supposition say you is contrary to the former and destroys the former and in destroying the former it destroys the expressions the proportions and every thing else derived from the former supposition not too fast good mr logician if i say the increments now exist and the increments do not now exist the latter assertion will be contrary to the former supposing now to mean the same instant of time in both assertions but if i say at one time the increments now exist and say an hour after the increments do not now exist the latter assertion will neither be contrary nor contradictory to the former because the first now signifies one time and the second now signifies another time so that both assertions may be true the case therefore in your argument does not come up to your lemma unless you will say sir isaac newton supposes that there are increments and that there are no increments at the same instant of time which is what you have not said and what i hope you will not dare to say  but perhaps you will still maintain that whether the second supposition be esteemed contrary or not contrary to the first yet as the increments which were supposed at first to exist are now supposed not to exist but to be vanished and gone all the consequences of their supposed existence as their expressions proportions etc must now be supposed to be vanished and gone with them i cannot allow of this neither  let us imagine your self and me to be debating this matter in an open field at a distance from any shelter and in the middle of a large company of mathematicians and logicians a sudden violent rain falls the consequence is we are all wet to the skin before we can get to covert it clears up and the sun shines you are for going on with the dispute i desire to be excused i must go home and shift my clothes and advise you to do the same you endeavor to persuade me i am not wet the shower say you is vanished and gone and consequently your coldness and wetness and every thing derived from the existence of the shower must have vanished with it i tell you i feel my self cold and wet i take my leave and make haste home i am persuaded the mathematicians would all take the same course and should think them but very indifferent logicians that were moved by your arguments to stay behind  another example may make all clear i know a certain gentleman who about the first day of april      was verily persuaded he saw more clearly into the principles of fluxions than sir isaac newton had ever done the consequence of this persuasion was that he published a book which immediately convinced all mankind of the contrary he has since had such reasons given him as have entirely altered his opinion his former persuasion is vanished and gone but the book that was the consequence of that persuasion is not vanished and gone with it it would have been much for his credit and for the quiet of the poor genlemans mind if it had  xxxv you mistake me sir what i dislike in you is not your modesty but your arrogance it is your unparalled and amazing insolence to the greatest discoverer of truth of a mere mortal that ever appeared in the world  i am of opinion that placing the same point in various lights is of great use to explain it  you have not shown sir isaac newton s various accounts of fluxions to be inconsistent i find them perfectly consistent and do again profess my self greatly obliged to him for his condescension in setting his doctrine in several different lights without which i still doubt i should never have understood it  but you seem to think it great vanity in me to talk as if i understood the doctrine of fluxions why sir i hope sir isaac newton wrote so as to be understood by somebody i have taken pains to understand him and i suppose many others to understand him likewise i prefer my self to no body and i never compare my self with any body but one it is where i speak of such ordinary proficients in mathematics as you and me even there you see i have the good manners to place you first had i said no body understands him but i or i dont understand him and therefore no body can understand him it were unpardonable vanity  you say i insult you in asking what it is you are offended at who do not still understand him i neither insult you nor blame you for not understanding him but it is i think pretty extraordinary for a man who so often professes not to understand sir isaac newton to complain that sir isaac takes too much pains to explain and illustrate his doctrine by setting it in several different lights as to your request to help you out of the dark i have done my best and hope you see much better than you did the eyewater i have applied might possibly give you some pain but it will do you a power of good e coelo descendit   xxxvi i flatter my self i have already done to your mind what you here request  xxxvii if i were to say there are a hundred mean and low artifices in a certain pamphlet scarce a section without one or more too scandalous and too trifling to mention this is plain to me but i will not undertake to demonstrate it to others is this the same as to say i cannot demonstrate it to others no but it would take up too much of my time it would swell my letter to too great a bulk to demonstrate it you say below i neither will nor can you make therefore a difference between the meaning of these two words  xxxviii in this section you address yourself to me in the following words you will have it that i represent sir isaac newtons conclusions as coming out right because one error is compensated by another contrary and equal error which perhaps he never knew himself nor thought of that by a twofold mistake he arrives though not at science yet at truth that he proceeds blindfold etc all which is untruly said by you who have misapplied to sir isaac newton what was intended for the marquis de lhospital and his followers if this was untruly said by me i assure you it was not a wilful untruth you see mr walton fell into that mistake as well as i and i do not know a single person who has read the analyst but is in the same mistake however a mistake it undoubtedly is no body ought in the least to dispute it after a person of your character has made the public declaration just now recited and has farther assured us that this double error does concern the marquis alone and not sir isaac newton far be it from me to call the truth or sincerity of this declaration in question on the contrary i ask your pardon for my mistake and to make you all the satisfaction in my power i do hereby retract recant and abjure my error and abandon my picture my ingenious portraiture of sir isaac newton and dame fortune to the flames if you are not yet satisfied i beg leave to allege the following reasons in mitigation of my offense    your discourse seemed to me to be directed to a follower of sir isaac newton and as in sect xx of the analyst where this affair of the double error begins you perpetually address yourself to him in the second person as you demonstrate you are conversant you conceive you proceed you apply your conclusions your logic and method etc i too hastily judged that the double error related to this follower and consequently to his master    as this affair is pursued through eleven sections beginning at sect xx and ending with sect xxx i find sir isaac newtons way of notation to be used in three of those sections and the marquiss notation in two i find sir isaacs language and expression as increments moments fluxions infinitely diminished vanish etc to be used in nine of those sections and the marquiss language and expression as differences infinitesimals etc in seven of those sections whence it seemed to me that sir isaac newton was as much concerned in this matter as the marquis    in one of those sections namely sect xxvi you refer to sect xii and xiii in the first of which sections viz sect xii i find this quotation philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica lib   lemm   and sect xiii contains nothing else but your instance of false reasoning taken from sir isaac newtons book of quadratures likewise in another of those sections namely sect xxviii i find the same thirteenth section quoted from all which it seemed to me that sir isaac newton was rather more concerned in this affair than the marquis whose works i do not find to be quoted in any of those sections so much as once    the arguments used in the analyst seemed to me to bear equally hard against sir isaac newton and the marquis so that i could not see how you could condemn the one and acquit the other of either of the two errors  these considerations had so fully possessed my mind that sir isaac newton was supposed by you to be guilty of this double error that nothing but my firm persuasion of your veracity and integrity could ever have removed that apprehension i must own i have still one scruple upon my thoughts if you will be so good as to remove that my mind will be perfectly easy about this affair it is this  the first error in giving   xdx for the difference or   xx for the moment of xx is common to the marquis and sir isaac newton  the marquis makes a second error which perfectly corrects the first whence his conclusion comes out right  sir isaac newton makes no second error to correct his first and therefore his conclusion ought to come out wrong  and yet sir isaacs conclusion comes out exactly right and is the same with the marquiss conclusion the more i consider this the more it puzzles me possibly for want of the philosophia prima which you are so great a master of  xxxix as you do not persist nay on the contrary desist and entirely disown your accusing sir isaac newton of this double error methinks there is now no occasion for my producing any evidence to justify him but you are pleased to call publicly upon me to produce it to deny as strongly as i affirm to aver that my declaring i have such evidence is an unquestionable proof of the matchless contempt that i philalethes have for truth why this indeed is matchless  blindness or assurance shall i call it i beg the reader will turn to p  0 of my defense there he will see i have already produced my evidence and have named the passages where these very objections of yours appear to have been foreseen and to be clearly and fully removed i have there named the passages i say though you have suppressed them and every reader who is qualified to examine those passages will find what i say to be true and that the pretense of your first error is fully removed by lemma   and that of the second by lemma    xl i have nothing to say to the principles of the marquis de lhospital i defend nothing but his reasoning you say he rejects infinitesimals in virtue of a postulatum and this you venture to call rejecting them without ceremony i know of no greater ceremony used by euclid than to reject a thing in necessary and unavoidable consequence of a postulatum you tell me he infers a conclusion accurately true contrary to the rules of logic from inaccurate and false premises this i deny for if his premises be allowed his conclusion will follow by the strictest rules of logic though those premises are false allow him his first postulatum and then   xdx will be equal to   xdx dxdx allow him his second postulatum and then rn in your figure analyst p    will be equal to rl and his conclusion must come out right it seems therefore that the marquis is acquitted of this double error as well as sir isaac newton and that it is you alone who have acted blindfold as not knowing the true reason of the conclusions coming out accurately right which i show not to have been the effect of a double error but of his two postulata  xli to all this declamation i shall need to give no other reply than one you furnish me with p    of this very answer it must be owned say you that after you have misled and amused your less qualified reader as you call him you return to the real point in controversy and set your self to justify sir isaac s method in getting rid of the abovementioned quantity i think i have already told you that i had talked so much of the smallness of the error only for the information of some great churchmen to make them sensible of the consequence of your discovery in order to induce them the more readily to join in the hymn to your honor  you say to me you affirm and indeed what can you not affirm that the difference between the true subtangent and that found without any compensation is absolutely nothing at all these are not my words you will perhaps affirm that they express my sense i deny it i neither speak thus nor mean thus nor have any meaning like this but the direct contrary with regard to the subtangent determined without any compensation upon the principles of the marquis de lhospital who alone is here referred to  xlii empty childish declamation  xliii the same or something worse i apprehend it was as you say discreetly done to fix upon two or three of the main points and to overlook the rest of the difficulties proposed in the analyst particularly the queries threescore and seven in number you tell me i am not afraid nor ashamed to represent the analysts as very clear and uniform in their conceptions of these matters where have i so represented them i know there is a great diversity of opinions among analysts some follow monsieur leibnitz some the marquis de lhospital some other writers and some whom i take to be the better judges follow sir isaac newton and these are uniform so far as they follow their master and clear so far as they understand him  xliv if you have met with all these different opinions in conversation with analysts in ten months time and some analysts perhaps   or   of every one of those opinions one would think that country where you have resided for those ten months must be better stocked with mathematicians than all the rest of europe i hope they are not all infidels if they are it is a mercy they are not very able infidels at least so far as one can judge of them by their mathematical opinions otherwise i should apprehend religion to be in great danger there unless that country be well stocked with men able to deal with them at their own weapons and to show they are by no means those masters of reason which they would fain pass for  xlv xlvi xlvii xviii you come now to the point of metaphysics in dispute between us about which you write contrary to your usual manner so very inaccurately and unintelligibly as plainly convinces me you have some other end to serve than truth and upon revising what i had before addressed to you upon this subject i think i neither can nor need set that matter in a clearer light than i have already done i perceive likewise my rebukes have had a good effect upon you you make excuses it was not you say with intent to carp or cavil at a single passage you talk no more of manifest staring contradictions no you express your self with some modesty all this looks very like a contradiction with some other signs of grace that give me hopes as you are now made to see your errors you may in time be brought to acknowledge them  it must be owned in your favor you have already recanted the principal of them and that which led to all the rest as amply and fully as from you could possibly be expected you had expressed your self in art cxxv of your new theory of vision in the following words after reiterated endeavors to apprehend the general idea of a triangle i have found it altogether incomprehensible but now ut primum discussaeumbrae and lux redditamenti your eyes being opened pardon me this vanity by the arguments i have done my self the honor of laying before you you are pleased to say this implies that i hold there are no general ideas but i hold the direct contrary that there are indeed general ideas but not formed by abstraction in the manner set forth by mr lock  i am so much pleased with this piece of ingenuity and candid proceeding that for the sake of it i willingly excuse all that follows however inconsistent with this recantation particularly your making no difference between a round square and a space comprehended by three right lines for the same reason i willingly pass by your supposing that the words of my definition have no ideas or conceptions of the mind joined with them and consequently that the definition has no meaning for to make the definition have a meaning some particular idea simple or compound must be joined to every word used in it and a compound idea made up of all those particular ideas must be joined to and always go along with the whole definition and these two the compound idea and the definition are inseparable if the definition be understood methinks therefore instead of separating these it were better to make a distinction between this compound idea answering to the definition of a triangle and the image or sensible representation of a triangle two things which i have observed you often to confound both here and in your other writings the compound idea is general but the image if exactly attended to and adequately perceived by the mind must always be particular  xlix you here propose some points for the reader to reflect upon and examine by my light when you well know i never endeavored to give him any light about them in this second letter indeed i have at your request endeavored to explain some part of them but there are some others which i am so far from being able to explain that i never heard of them before and cannot imagine what you mean by them possibly they may be some arcana of the boeotian analysis explicable only by the philosophia prima  l as these queries are not proposed to me i leave it to the consideration of my learned friends of this university whether they deserve or need any answer  i am sir your most obedient servant philalethes cantabrigiensis  finis
