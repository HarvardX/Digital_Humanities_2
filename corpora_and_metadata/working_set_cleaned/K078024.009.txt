as a distinct species from their very dissimilar appearance in one sex the upper surface is brown and in the other a fine blue this is not however peculiar to the p argus for several of the papilio tribe known amongst english collectors by the trivial name blues differ in the same manner  we suspect that our insect has not been described by any author it is certainly unnoticed by fabricius in
