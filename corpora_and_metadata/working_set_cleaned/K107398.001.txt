mr denniss letters familiar moral and critical  original letters familiar moral and critical  by mr dennis  in two volumes  volume the first  london printed for w mears at the lamb without temple bar mdccxxi  preface i here present the reader with a volume of letters writ upon very different occasions at very different times they are far from being all of them equal but i hope their variety will make amends for their inequality i make no doubt but that upon perusal of the critical part of them the old accusation will be brought against me and there will be a fresh outcry among thoughtless people that i am an illnatured man it is very odd that i should have that character only from persons who never knew me and who never were once in my company but there are people in the world who imagine that criticism must be the effect of ill nature these persons know not what is meant by either of the terms either criticism or ill nature otherwise they would be convinced that a good criticism is the bestnaturd thing in the world for by goodness of nature must be meant something that comes up to the true nature of man else it would be a term of reproach instead of commendation but the true nature of man is a reasonable and a social nature and a good criticism is both reasonable and social it detects error illustrates truth advances art and consequently has a direct tendency to the advancement of the national honor if this last is true of good criticism in general it must be most true of a just criticism upon the tragedy of cato that tragedy met with success which never any other did it was acted for a month together it has been translated into french and into italian which never happened to any of our dramatick poems before and it is plain to all the judges of poetry that it has a thousand shameful faults and very few natural beauties what must the knowers in france and italy say upon reading these translations must they not discourse after this manner the english nation boast much of their poetry they extol to the skies their shakespeare their ben johnson their milton but yet they applaud nothing so loudly as this tragedy of cato they have got it translated both into french and italian and have sent it to us as a masterpiece to insult us else why has this tragedy only been translated and yet this tragedy at the same time that it has a thousand faults and most of them very gross ones has very few beauties and those which it has are perhaps not of british growth but are derived from lucan and seneca what then must we think of those other poets their shakespeare their ben johnson their milton whom they formerly so much extolled but not half so much as cato must we not conclude that these islanders are very indifferent poets and more indifferent judges  i appeal to the reasonable and impartial reader if this must not be the sense of all the knowing french and italians who have seen these translations let the reasonable and impartial reader judge then if a just criticism upon cato was not absolutely necessary both for the advantage of dramatick poetry to which the undeserved success of this tragedy has done infinite harm and for the vindication of the national honor let the reader judge if it was not necessary that a man who owns that he admires the noble genius of shakespeare admires the unparalleled sublimity of the paradise lost of milton that he is infinitely pleased with the masterpieces of ben johnson and exceedingly delighted with several of our other comic poets should give his reasons to all the world why he has no esteem for cato  if what i have said is not sufficient to appease the fury of a headlong cabal but they will still cry out that the critical letters in this volume upon the tragedy of cato are the effects of ill nature i must beg leave to exclaim in my turn that those persons let them be who they will show a deplorable want of public spirit who can prefer the reputation of one man and a reputation which he does not deserve to possess before the advantage of a noble art and the honor of their country  but perhaps it is not the author of cato that these persons are so much concerned for it is themselves it is themselves and their own satisfaction which they prefer to the prosperity of the commonwealth of learning and to the good and honor of their country there are in the world very vain persons who are resolved to maintain the good opinion which they have of themselves at the expense of every thing and utterly detest the man who shall dare to disturb them in the possession of it by showing them that they have passed a very foolish judgment  if any are disgusted that these observations are published after the death of the author of that tragedy i can assure them that they were writ in two long letters to a friend immediately after the remarks which were printed by what artifice those two letters were got out of my hands by what fortune i recovered the substance of them and how it came to take the form which it now has i shall not here declare not the first through regard to the memory of the dead nor the two latter through respect to the precious time of the living  before i take my leave of this subject i think my self obliged to do justice to the memory of mr addison who was certainly a learned and very ingenious man and several of the tatlers and spectators which were writ by him deserved the applause which they met with  i hope that what i have said will suffice to satisfy every reasonable impartial reader who is a true lover of his country

   read it is letters familiar moral and critical december        to sir richard blackmore on the moral and conclusion of an epick poem sir when i sent you my observations upon the two first acts of the play i sent you so many reasons which obliged me to differ from you with respect to the encomium which you give to that tragedy in your essay upon epick poetry and whenever you think fit to lay your commands upon me i shall lay before you the reasons for which i dissent from you with regard to the commendation which you give to a late translation at present i shall pass to things more general and consequently of far great importance  in the chapter which treats of the moral you are pleased to affirm two things the first is that one who writes an epick poem need not in his first intention pitch upon some considerable moral and then contrive his fable suitable to that design the second thing is that there is no occasion that an epick poem should end fortunately with regard to the principal character  but sir before i give my reasons for dissenting from you with regard to these two points the first of which is of consequence and the second of the utmost importance i desire that you would give me leave to enumerate some things in which we perfectly agree that by this method we may facilitate an agreement in things in which we differ  we agree then sir in the following points    that there must be a fable essay p      that there must be an action ess p      that the action must be one p ibid   that there must be a moral p      that the fable and the action must be only for the moral ibid and p      that the moral must be the genuine result of the fable and the action p      that admiration ought to be the predominant passion in the narration of the action p      nothing that is common or ordinary can excite admiration p    and      that there ought to be an allegory p    these sir are things in which we agree expressly there are other things in which we agree implicitly because if these last are false they destroy the truth even of those in which we agree expressly as that    the moral must contain an undeniable truth or else it cannot be a moral for falsehood may delude but only truth can instruct   that the instruction which the poem gives must be general moral philosophy being the law of nature and consequently instructive to mankind   that the poetic action must remain general even after the imposition of names for if the action is particular there can be no general instruction deduced from it the conclusion being false to generals from particulars   that for the same reason the characters at the bottom must be general likewise even after the imposition of names   that the action and characters being both general even after the imposition of names they must be consequently both allegorical let us come now sir to the two forementioned particulars  you say that an epick poet is not obliged to have the moral first in his mind for say you no author can form the narration of any great and memorable action but some moral will arise from it whether the writer intends it or not suppose this were true a poet is to instruct by his art and not by chance but the very contrary of this is true a poet may form the narration of a hundred great and memorable actions if these actions are particular and historical and not one moral shall arise from them all as the battle of pharsalia the death of brutus and cassius the death of cato the death of king lear the death of hamlet the death of harry the fourth and i defy any poet to form a general action and general characters but he must form them upon a moral and consequently that moral must be first in his head can any one believe that aesop first told a story of a cock and a bull and afterward made a moral to it or is it reasonable to believe that he made his moral first and afterward to prove it contrived his fable now i know no difference that there is between one of aesops fables and the fable of an epick poem as to their natures though there be many and great ones as to their circumstances it is impossible for a poet to form any fable unless the moral be first in his head  you say that since homer and virgil does not expressly draw any doctrine from their fables it is not certain whether they designed any and it is still more uncertain you say whether they intended those particular morals which are generally ascribed to them which is as much as to say that though we can see a design a good a just and a great design in those admirable poems yet the authors of them saw none and that perhaps that is not their design which appears to us and others but something which after so many ages has appeared to no man could homer or virgil if they had studied a thousand years have contrived morals which would have been more the genuine result of all the parts of their fables and of their actions than those which are generally ascribed to them or can those morals be made to appear the genuine result of any other poetic actions unless they are copies of those  you continue to say that as from pulpit discourses on divine subjects many useful inferences may be deduced by the preacher so in these superior poems etc but here sir you appear not to consider that the grand moral of every sermon is the text which certainly is or ought to be first in the mind of every preacher  to conclude my remarks on this first point it appears to me evident that every man who undertakes any great action has the chief design which he proposes by it first of all in his head but you yourself are pleased to own p    that the principal end of an epick poet is to give pleasure and instruction and p    that the pleasure is only in order to the instruction and p    that the most important part of the instruction ought to arise from the whole fable because the instruction that arises from the whole must be more important than that which arises from the parts by owning all which it is clear to me that you implicitly own that the moral of an epick poem must be first in the head of the poet  i now sir come to the second point concerning which we differ you are pleased to affirm that it is not necessary that an epick poem should end happily with relation to the principal character but that the poets and mere critics have laid down this rule without consulting reason in the case being led into it by the iliad and odysses of homer and the aeneis of virgil and here you deplore that servile submission which the poets and commentators have made to naked anthority by which they have advanced maxims out of reverence to great names without any discussion of the subject or entering upon any enquiry which supports their assertion because say you the end of the epick poet may be equally attained though the event should be unfortunate into which we are now to enquire  the principal character of an epick poem must be either morally good or morally vicious if he is morally good the making him end unfortunately will destroy all poetical justice and consequently all instruction such a poem can have no moral and consequently no fable no just and regular poetical action but must be a vain fiction and an empty amusement oh but there is a retribution in futurity but i thought that the reader of an epick poem was to owe his instruction to the poet and not to himself well then the poet may tell him so at the latter end of his poem ay would to god i could see such a latter end of an epick poem where the poet should tell the reader that he has cut an honest mans throat only that he may have an opportunity to send him to heaven and that though this would be but an indifferent plea upon an indictment for murder at the old bailey yet that he hopes the goodnatured reader will have compassion on him as the gods have on his hero but raillery apart sir what occasion is there for having recourse to an epick poet to tell our selves by the bye and by occasional reflection that there will be a retribution in futurity when the christian has this in his heart constantly and directly and the atheist and freethinker will make no such reflection tell me truly sir would not such a poet appear to you or me not to have sufficiently considered what a poetical moral is and should not you or i sir be obliged in order to make him comprehend the nature of it to lay before him that universal moral which is the foundation of all morals both epick and dramatick and is inclusive of them all and that is that he who does good and perseveres in it shall always be rewarded and he who does ill and perseveres in it shall always be punished should we not desire him to observe that the foresaid reward must always attend and crown good actions not sometimes only for then it would follow that sometimes a perseverance in good actions has no reward which would take away all poetical instruction and indeed every sort of moral instruction resolving providence into chance or fate should we not sir farther put him in mind that since whoever perseveres in good actions is sure to be rewarded at the last it follows that a poet does not assert by his moral that he is always sure to be rewarded in this world because that would be false as you have very justly observed p  0 and therefore never can be the moral of an epick poem because what is false may delude but only truth can instruct should we not let him know sir that this universal moral only teaches us that whoever perseveres in good actions shall be always sure to be rewarded either here or hereafter and that the truth of this moral is proved by the poet by making the principal character of his poem like all the rest of his characters and like the poetical action at the bottom universal and allegorical even after distinguishing it by a particular name by making this principal character at the bottom a mere poetical phantom of a very short duration through the whole extent of which duration we can see at once which continues no longer than the reading of the poem and that being over the phantom is to us nothing so that unless our sense is satisfied of the reward that is given to this poetical phantome whose whole duration we see through from the very beginning to the end instead of a wholesome moral there would be a pernicious instruction viz that a man may persevere in good actions and not be rewarded for it through the whole extent of his duration that is neither in this world nor in the world to come  but though the principal character of an epick poem is morally vicious yet the poem ought not to end unfortunately with relation to that principal character but here sir i think my self obliged to explain my self by a character morally vicious i by no means mean a villainous character because a villain can never have greatness of mind nor greatness of capacity sufficient to perform things deserving to be admired but admiration is as it were the instrument by which the poet works his end which is instruction as has been acknowledged  by a character morally vicious then i mean such a character as is compounded of good and bad qualities the good at the same time overcoming the bad and hiding them as the sun does mercury by the greatness of their neighboring luster now a poet is not to make an heroic poem end unfortunately with relation to such a character because such an end would weaken and destroy that admiration which is requisite for the poets attaining his end and destroy or weaken it in the very place where its influence is most requisite for as the greatest impression that a poem is to make ought to be made at the end of it the reigning passion of that poem ought to predominate most there as therefore terror and compassion ought to be most violently moved at the catastrophe of a tragedy and laughter at that of a comedy admiration ought to be raised to its utmost height at the end of an epick poem but if that poem should end unfortunately with relation to such a compounded character as we have just mentioned above it would cause great indignation in some and great compassion in others now as great indignation and great compassion are always attended with grief admiration is constantly accompanied with joy an epick poet therefore by exciting compassion or indignation at the latter end of his poem instead of admiration would make that poem throw off its nature and assume that of tragedy which is as directly contrary to its own as grief is to joy or as light is to darkness  nor would such a prosperous end in relation to such a character be in the least a violation of poetic justice though for the most part in tragedy it would be a very great one because the hero of an epick poem always carries on some good and great design for the advantage of that society of which he is the chief or an illustrious member at least it has been so in all the epick poems i have yet seen though this is far from being always the case in tragedy now that public virtue makes compensation for all faults but crimes and he who has this public virtue is not capable of crimes the ancient romans and athenians while liberty flourished among them would have looked very coldly upon a poet who should have shown a great patriot unfortunate only for being a great patriot in order to encourage public virtue and public spirit and the love of their country they obliged their epick poets to show those virtues crowned with glory and felicity nay the ancients made the very future happiness of their heroes depend upon the success of their good and great designs for the welfare of their country witness that famous passage in the fragment of cicero de somnio ciceronis sed quo sis africane alacrior ad tutandam rempublicam sic habeto oomnibus qui patriam conservaverint adjuverint auxerint certum esse in caelo ac definitum locum ubi beati aevo sempiterno fruantur  for my part i have no notion that a suffering hero can be proper for epick poetry milton could make but very little even of a suffering god who makes quite another impression with his lightning and his thunder in paradise lost than with his meckness and his stoicism in paradise regained that great spirit which heroic poetry requires flows from great passions and from great actions if the suffering hero remains insensible the generality of readers will not be much concerned for one who is so little concerned for himself the greatness of his mind may perhaps be admired by a few who are themselves magnanimous but the author of an epick poem ought to write to mankind and not only to the age wherein he lives but to remotest posterity if the hero of an epick poem should not appear insensible in his sufferings his sensibility will be attended with passions which are not only incompatible with that admiration which ought to be moved through the poem but which will sink its spirit and debase its majesty  let us then sir leave the virtues of patience and long suffering to be taught by priests they will not fail to inculcate such doctrines frequently as being at once consistent with their duty and their craft but never fear that they will entrench upon your province and recommend public virtue and public spirit and the love of their country to a people whom they have shown too clearly that it is their design to enslave but for your part sir that you may deserve more and more of your country and of mankind make choice of a hero whose every action may flow from those noble principles and reform a degenerate age which seems so fond of slavery let his great actions be crowned with glory and victory with the joyful acclamations of the people whom he has made happy by his heroic conduct and virtue and with such transcendent felicity as may raise the highest admiration in the breast of every reader inflame every one of them with the love of his country and with a burning zeal to imitate what he admires  october         to henry cromwell esquire on the vis comica sir when i had the favor of a visit from you the other day i was in a great deal of pain and had been so for a day and a night before you saw me and continued so for the same space of time after you left me and then i voided a stone about the bigness of a pea and so thanks be to god have been ever since at ease  but what perhaps may surprise you is this that in the midst of all this misery i read over four comedies of terence viz the eunuch the heautontimorumenos the adelphi and the phormio these i read over in the two evenings ofmy illness in the cambridge quarto edition a very convenient one for a person of my gravity in a winters evening though he who had the care of the edition understood nothing of the stage in the two mornings of my illness i read over mrs daciers comment upon the four comedies and upon the life of terence writ by suetonius i have told you more than once that when the commentators had sometimes led me into a bog my own common sense had helped to guide me out again you may guess what a deference i pay to the herd of commentators when you will see by what follows that i have the assurance to contradict monsieur le fevre and mrs dacier his daughter for whose learning judgment and fine discernment i have always had a singular regard and esteem  you know very well sir that suetonius in the latter end of his life of terence has mentioned some verses of julius caesar in which that emperor calls terence a demi menander and complains that the vis comica was wanting to that comic poet  tu quoque tu in summis o dimidiate menander poneris and merito puri sermonis amator lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta foret vis comica ut aequato virtus polleret honor cum graecis neque in hac despectus part jaceres unum hoc maceror and doleo tibi deesse terenti mrs dacier in her remarks upon that part of the life says that it was the opinion of her father monsieur le fevre that by the vis comica caesar meant the passions from which opinion the daughter dissents for the two following reasons first because the passions are natural and essential to tragedy and but incidental to comedy secondly because it is impossible to preserve the characters as terence has admirably done without making them speak upon occasion with as much passion as that occasion requires which is not only justly but very finely observed and indeed we find that the passions in terence upon great surprises are extreme lively and strong and when horace tells us in his art of poetry that comedy sometimes usurps upon tragedy and has passions which are next to tragical he brings his example from the heautontimorumenos of terence  interdum tamen and vocem comoedia tellit iratusque chremes tumido delitigat ore but the explication which mrs dacier her self gives of the words of caesar is not a jot better than her fathers for by vis comica says she caesar meant the vivacity of the action and the tying and solving the knot of the intrigue which is wrong for two reasons first because these both belong to tragedy as nearly as they do to comedy and secondly because if caesar had understood by his vis comica what mrs dacier thinks he did he could never have called terence a demi menander for terence having the business of two of menanders comedies in one of his and the grecian comedy being of as great a length as the roman terence must consequently have more intrigue and a greater vivacity of action than menander and consequently if caesar by his vis comica had meant the intrigue and the vivacity of action he would have nominated terence a double instead of a demi menander  but since i have declared my self not at all satisfied with either the fathers or the daughters explication you may perhaps expect that i should give my own i shall do it with submission but upon this condition that if i am in the wrong you and your commentators shall set me right  i am apt to believe both from the terms and the reason of the thing that by the vis comica must be meant something comical and peculiar to comedy for the chief force of any kind of poem must consist in that which makes the characteristick of it and which distinguishes it from all other poems as the chief force of tragedy must proceed from the moving compassion and terror strongly and the chief force of epick poetry from the exciting admiration powerfully so the chief force of comedy must consist in exciting laughter by the vis comica then can never be meant the bare vivacity of the action and the tying and solving the knot of the intrigue which is common to both kinds of dramatick poetry as has been observed above but the lively ridicule resulting from the intrigue the ridicule of the incidents and especially of the catastrophe which yet is but a part of the vis comica for there is likewise the ridicule of the characters proceeding from their several humors and the pleasantry of the sentiments and of the dialogue when caesar therefore says that terence is but a demi menander what does he say but that terence had turned four or five of menanders comedies into latin and lost half the ridicule and the pleasantry of that athenian poet in translating him that this was caesars meaning is plain to me not only from the reason and the nature of the thing which has been shown above but from the great delight which caesar took in the ridiculum and the great encouragement which he gave to the mimes of laberius and publius syrus which were low farces composed on purpose only to make people laugh as likewise from the method which terence took in his versions for taking two of menanders plays into one of his he must of necessity leave a great part of his dialogue behind him and by consequence a great part of his pleasantry so that the same thing happened to menander formerly which has befallen moliere in our days several english authors have translated parts of him but not one of them has entered into that naiuete which is the purest source of his pleasantry as indeed it is of pleasantry in general for what the french call naiuete which is a charming simplicity dictated by pure nature is almost always original for there is something in it so easy so free so flowing and so natural as ies the restraint of a copy i do not pretend to say that there was none of the naiuete of menander in terence but i may venture to say after caesar that there is not above half of it and consequently not above half his pleasantry though at the same time i believe that there is more of this quality in terence than ever there was in a copy and if the god of laughter does not always attend upon terence venus and the graces never leave him it is my humble opinion that there is no dialogue extant in any language which has half the charms of the terentian dialogue what comes nearest to it is that of etherege in sir fopling flutter i who have been acquainted with terence above forty years am now more delighted with him than ever and sure that beauty must be no common charmer in whom time shall discover new graces and whom long possession renders more desirable  thus have i given you my sentiments if what i take to be the sense of caesar be not your own i desire you would set me right  i am etc  to n row esquire on his being made surveyor at the customhouse and his marriage sir i have been for several weeks together endeavoring to wait on you but i have lately had an intermitting fever and several fits of the stone which have brought me very low so that i can only congratulate you thus by letter upon your new post in the customhouse i was very much surpised when i saw it in the public news for knowing it to be only a warrant place and consequently a place which a man cannot supply by proxy i did not understand how it could be compatible either with your pleasures or with your other business however if you are pleased i am so likewise and once more i congratulate you  but sir i had almost forgot myself instead of congratulating you upon one office i should wish you joy of two you are become a husband since i saw you last as well as a land surveyor jesu what alteration must not those two offices have made in the life of a gentleman who loved to lie in bed all day for his ease and to sit up all night for his pleasure i must confess you are not so much a novice in the former of these employments as you are in the latter i think you were heretofore several years in the former but is not the business and duty of a husband such that a man grows less and less qualified to discharge it the longer he has been in the office an office in which the incumbent grows incapacitated by too much and too long an experience  i am sir your etc whitehall saturday october        to his grace the duke of argyle written in the name and at the request of mr penkethman the comedian when he was a prisoner in the kings bench and just recovering from a great fit of sickness my lord since i had the honor to play the fool before your grace here it has been my misfortune in the same place to act a very melancholy part for which your grace knows very well that nature has not adapted me and for which i can assure your grace that i have not the least inclination but the part that i have been forced to act to the life and almost to the death has had so much tragedy in it that the spectators thought more than once that i would have gone quite off the stage in an ill humor  i have may it please your grace passed the beginning of this winter in southwark as my old patron and your graces old friend phoebus passed it in greenland i have never risen till twelve and after i have been up little more than an hour have been forced to go to bed again have like him looked very pale and wan all the time i have been up and have been for the most part of that time as i may say under a cloud and it has been constantly expected when like my old patron i should have gone under the horizon for a long time before i rose again  but while i was thus between life and death and in sore tribulation my old patron came to me by night at the time when he disappeared to all the other mortals of this hemisphere and giving me a swinging lug by the ear that has made one side of my head sore ever since pinky quoth he be of good cheer i have found a way to free thee from all thy troubles i have put my old and valued friend in mind of thee who has promised me to talk with colonel churchil about ways and means to release thee what friend said i may it please thy godship with that he directly named your grace to me he did my lord as i hope once more to be a merry fool instead of a sour melancholy sage as i at this instant am my old and valued friend quoth he has a kindness for all my domestics who do their business so as to please him and me his star and mine shall shine in benign conjuction thee i will heal thee his grace and the colonel will order a contribution for thee and thou shall shortly act a ridiculous squire in drury instead of a sullen dying sophister in the borough  but quoth i to my old patron may i put his grace in mind of this and will not he take it ill thou may put him in mind of it answered he and i will pawn my divinity on it that he will not take it ill  thus my lord depending on his divinity and on your graces humanity i have presumed to send you this and if your grace takes it otherwise than it was meant which was to bespeak your favor and to entertain you i will never for the future believe in phoebus and will have no more dependence on him than has a small poet who tires successively four pair of horses to engage persons of quality to come to his third night  i am my lord your graces most humble and most dutiful servant w penkethman postscript my lord since i had the honor to write what is above to your grace phoebus has appeared again to me and by another lug made the other side of my head sore pinky quoth he thou know that we great wits have often bad memories i quite forgot to order thee to remind his grace of the method which he has resolved to use in working thy deliverance his grace is resolved in a numerous assembly to put a guinea into a green purse and throwing it down upon the table to cry that is for pinkys deliverance that action and those words will have magic in them for strait upon the pronuncing them every mans guinea will of its own accord fly from his pocket to the table and will run rolling toward the green purse till it has joined and saluted his graces under which when they are united in a firm confederacy they will march in a body to the kings bench to deliver pinky from bondage thus will guineas answer the end of their creation which was to promote liberty as louis dors were coined on purpose to work bondage the scoundrel who arrested thee had two louis dors for his labor the mischief that lewis his image did thee king williams shall undoc this be assured of and i command thee to send this with my respects by way of postscript to his grace  borough southwark nov           to his grace the duke of marlborough my lord on the   th of december last i had the honor to receive a letter from your grace directed to mr walpole and enclosed in one from mr hodges to me i returned your grace that very night my humble acknowledgment for the extraordinary favor you had done me and if i have not yet had the honor to acquaint you with the effect it had it is because i have been in daily expectations of the event which is still depending but notwithstanding this delay my lord i am not yet like a man without hope it seems to me impossible that the duke of marlbroughs recommendation can ever come in vain it would be hard that he who has turned the fortune of europe should nor be able to alter mine and that your grace should receive that repulse from one of your friends which a hundred thousand of your enemies assembled in a body have never been able to give you  i am my lord your graces most humble and most obedient servant j dennis  to captain steel july       0 sir i sent a letter on the   th to your house directed to captain steel and desiring to see himthat night that i might have his advice upon a business of importance softly intimating at the same time that it was not in my power to wait upon him but having neither seen him nor heard from him i fancy that my old friend is departed and some gentleman has succeeded him in the old house with the same name and the same martial title a chance that happens oftener in the world than some people imagine how should i have been surpised in case i had gone my self expecting from the similitude of name and title to have seen my old acquaintance how should i have been surpised to have found a man with quite another mind and quite another countenance my old friend as i thought at least had civility had humanity had a good and engaging officiousness and as i did not take him to want good nature so he had what the french call a good countenance that is the countenance of one who is pleased with him who talks to him but i suppose i should have found nothing of all this in the noble captain who succeeds him you will say perhaps that you had no reason to make a visit to one whom you know not and are resolved not to know but then noble captain you ought to have sent back my letter and to have given me to understand that you are not the person that i took you for that you should have enough to do if you were obliged to own all the acquaintance of the captain your predecessor that i am not the first man who have made this mistake and shall not probably be the last had you done this i had had no replication to make to so equitable an answer i should only perhaps have advised you in order to the preventing some troublesome visits and some impertinent letters to cause an advertisement to be inserted in squire bickerstaffs next lucubrations by which the world might be informed that the captain steel who lives now in burystreet is not the captain of the same name who lived there two years ago and that the acquaintance of the military person who inhabited there formerly may go look for their old friend even where they can find him  i am your etc  to tho sergeant esquire upon the prospect from leithhill in surrey sir i have ever since i saw you last been either in motion or in places where ink is a liquor more precious than tockay but though i have ever since the beginning of july been in the country i have enjoyed small satisfaction if you except what the sight of the country itself affords me which is indeed an entertainment of which i can never be weary  i never in all my life time left it without regret and always returned to it with joy the sight of a mountain is to me more agreeable than that of the most pompous edifice and meadows and natural winding streams please me before the most beautiful gardens and the most costly canals so much does art appear to me to be surpassed by nature and the works of men by the works of god but here i desire you to believe that i speak of the mechanic works of men for as to the productions of human mind the more art some of them have as particularly some sorts of poetry the more lovely they are and more estimable because the more they have in them of true art the more they have of nature whereas in the mechanic works of men the contrary of this is seen for the more consummate an art appears in them the more they recede from plain and simple nature  but thither to return from whence i digressd as the sight of the country has been always more pleasing to me than that of the town so in a late journey which i took into the wild of sussex i passed over a hill which showed me a more transporting sight than ever the country had shown me before either in england or italy the prospects which in italy pleased me most were that of the valdarno from the apennins that of rome and the mediterranean from the mountain of viterbo of rome at forty and of the mediterranean at fifty miles distance from it and that of the campaign of rome from tiuoli and frescati from which two places you see every foot of that famous campaigne even from the bottom of tiuoli and frescati to the very foot of the mountain of viterbo without any thing to intercept your sight but from a hill which i passed in my late journey into sussex i had a prospect more extensive than any of these and which surpassed them at once in rural charms in pomp and in magnificence the hill which i speak of is called leith hill and is about five miles southward from darking about six from boxhill and near twelve from epsom it juts its self out about two miles beyond that range of hills which terminates the north downs to the south when i saw from one of those hills at about two miles distance that side of leith hill which faces the northern downs it appeared the beautifullest prospect to me i had ever seen but after we had conquered the hill it self i saw a sight that would transport a stoic a sight that looked like enchantment and vision but vision beatifick beneath us lay open to our view all the wilds of surrey and sussex and a great part of that of kent admirably diversifyed in every part of them with woods and fields of corn and pastures those fields of corn and pastures being every where adorned with stately rows of trees  this beautiful vale is about thirty miles in breadth and about sixty in length and is terminated to the south by the majestic range of the southern hills and the sea and it is no easy matter to decide whether these hills which appear at thirty forty fifty miles distance with their tops in the sky appear more awful and venerable or the delicious vale between you and them more inviting about noon in a serene day you may at thirty miles distance see the very water of the sea through a chasm of the mountains and that which above all makes it a noble and a wonderful prospect is that at the same time that at chirty miles distance you behold the very water of the sea at the same time that you behold to the south the most delicious rural prospect in the world at that very time by a little turn of your head toward the north you look full over box hill and see the country beyond it between that and london and over the very stomacher of it see st pauls at five and twenty miles distance and london beneath it and highgate and hampstead beyond it it may perhaps appear incredible to some that a place which affords so great and so surprising a prospect should have remained so long in obscurity in so great obscurity that it is unknown to the very frequenters of epsom and box hill but alas we live in a country more fertile of great things than of men to admire them who ever talked of coopers hill till sir john denham made it illustrious how long did milton remain in obscurity while twenty paltry authors little and vile if compared to him were talked of and admired but here in england nineteen in twenty like by other peoples opinions and not by their own that fools by their approbation should draw in fools as sheep leap after sheep is no great matter of wonder but that fools by their numbers should prove so powerful as to influence men of sense and engage them to approve of what they would otherwise utterly have contemned is what i have often wondered at but never could yet account for but such unnatural monstrous things as these make the town more odious and the country more agreeable  i am etc hampstead aug         oct        to s t esquire on the deceitfulness of rumor sir it was always my opinion that judgment is a cool and a slow faculty and no more constantly attends a man in the warmth of wine and of conversation than in the fury and rapture of a poetical composition if i had in the least doubted of this what past at your house on the first of this month would have perfectly convinced me of it where for want of coolness to consider things i betrayed my own cause and that of my departed friend mr wycherly i shall say but a word or two of my own but i desire to be a little longer about his  i then declared it to be my opinion that freethinking would at one time or other endanger our constitution that it invalidates the very things which are the greatest security both of princes and people and those are the oaths which the subjects of great britain take either as subjects or witnesses to which a gentleman in the company answered that the oaths derived their binding force from the very law of nature as well as from the christian religion with which answer for want of coolness and time to consider i remained at that instant satisfied  but as soon as i bad coolness and time to consider i found that a double reply might justly be made to that answer of your friend for in the first place the freethinkers are divided into atheists and deists now the former of these cannot be at all influenced by the law of nature for to them to whom there is no god there can be no law of nature and as for the latter though theists are influenced by the law of nature yet we ought to consider that the oath which an englishman is obliged to take as a subject or a witness derives its most binding force and its most sacred solemnity from that which distinguishes it from all other oaths and that is the laying hands upon the bible and kissing it which ceremonies are certainly not deduceable from the law of nature but are wholly derived from that revelation which the theists do not believe freethinking then is the cause why both atheists and theists by contemning those ceremonies and disbelieving the revelation from whence they are derived are come slightly to regard the very oath it self yes freethinking is the cause that at this time of day we have so many brave knightserrant of the post both spiritual and secular  that eat perfidiously their words and swear their ears through twoinch boards can own the same thing and disown and perjure booty pro and con can make the gospel serve their turn and help them out to be forsworn when it is laid hands upon and kissed to be betrayed and sold like christ thus have i spoke to my own cause in as few words as i could i desire to dwell a little longer upon my late friend mr wycherlys a gentleman in the company was pleased to say that the comedy of the country wife had not a just foundation because said he it was not practicable for horner to make himself pass for an eunuch how not practicable when he himself was at the bottom of the design and had taken so many precautions to make it succeed i am so far from being of your friends opinion that i would lay fifty to one if i were but capable of suborning half a dozen rascals who should warmly and industriously spread the report that i would make either you or your friend pass for freethinkers with a considerable part of the town in spite of your utmost attempts to undeceive them how can that be you will say when there would be neither truth nor probability in such a report but have truth or probability any thing to do with the entertainments of public rumor when my lord rochester said there is not a thing on earth that i can name so foolish and so false as common fame did he banter do you think or speak it from a thorough knowledge of the world and of mankind there is another of our poets who knew mankind perfectly well who will tell you the same thing in terms that are something stronger  the world is naturally averse to all the truth it sees or hears but swallows nonsense and a lie with greediness and gluttony butler part   cant   it is true indeed if the rabble and scum of mankind of whose voices public rumor is composed had but so much true sense as a sober beast why then the rule that horace has laid down for the tragic stage might do pretty well for the stage of the world  segnius irritant animos demissa per aures quam quae sint oculis subjecta fidelibus and quae ipse sibi tradit spectator but since the case is far otherwise and so many idiots will believe that they see what they only hear where as no dog no horse nay no ass is fool enough to let his external sense be imposed upon by his beastly imagination butler has been so far from thinking that horaces rule for the tragic stage is proper for the stage of the world that he has laid down for the latter one which is the very reverse of the other  for like the world mens jobbernoles turn round upon their ears the poles and what they are confidently told by no sense else can be controlled what my lord rochester and the author of hudibras have declared in their verses our dramatick poets have endeavored to show upon the stage viz that the eyes of the rabble of mankind are downright cullies to their ears and that they easily believe that they actually see what they are only impudently told of witness what passes between vindicius and old brutus in the junius brutus of lee and between hamlet and polonius in the hamlet of shakespeare which seems to be the original of the other and has not ben learned ben who is so great a master of his art and consequently of human life and nature shown us the very reverse of this in the catastrophe of his admirable alchimist viz shown us persons who what before they had actually seen are made to believe that they only vainly imagined and for no other reason but because they are impudently told that they only vainly imagined it  i tell you then again and again that i would undertake if i could but be brought to use the means to make both you and your friend pass for eunuchs in spite of the testimony of twenty females who might cry out in mrs pinchwifes language they will not see poor mr horner abused for to their certain knowledge  for though that perhaps might undeceive a few the general opinion would still remain for why may it not be as practicable to geld you and your friend as it has been to burst one of your old acquaintance in spite not only of truth but of all manner of probability in spite of his own solemn asseverations to the contrary of the continual vigorous exercises both of riding and walking which he has used of late and lastly in spite of ocular and manual proof to the contrary given to eminent surgeons and others when neither truth nor reasonable and strong presumption nor evidence of sense that has been given to several have been able to undeceive the many but the rupture has still remained in the empty heads of a thousand fools who have still endeavored to propagate the senseless error  for fools are stubborn in their way as coins are hardened by the allay and obstinacys never so stiff as when it is in a wrong belief hudib if any thing that i have said about this last affair may happen to surprise you the surprise i suppose will still be greater when you are told that the two apostles of this new doctrine like those of mahomet are downright ass and widgeon  the gross of mankind have infinitely more propensity to censure than to praise they generally praise through interest and they censure by inclination and yet the poison of false praise has more than once grown epidemically contagious by the error and imbecility of a few and the conspiracy of a false report you cannot have forgot what happened to that ugly beau bovey in the time of king charles the second  boveys a beauty if some few agree to call him so the rest to that degree affected are that with their ears they see you may remember that something like this has happened upon the representation of several of our dramatick performances when blundering sustain tragedies or trifling insipid comedies have by the conspiracy of a cabal and their concerted applauses been coggd upon the town for masterpieces to the dishonor of our country and disgrace of the british poetry some persons who have been in these conspiracies knew or ought to have known better things but one unaccountable effect of vanity among many others is that some persons though they do not want understanding yet at the expense of the reputation of their commonsense are fond of showing their power are fond of showing their power to fools at the expense of the reputation of their commonsense with the thinking part of the world  how often has something like this happened among our statesmen how often have they toppd white for black and black for white upon the thoughtless rabble how often have they who yesterday were thought heroes and patriots and demygods to day been looked upon as villains and thieves and robbers and they who yesterday were held villains and traitors have to day been regarded as heroes and saints and patriots have not our politicians more than once turned the rehearsal out of ridicule by turning the whole state topsy turvy in a morning only by the artillery of false reports without so much as striking a real blow and by that means proving to all the world that one might take mr bays for a politician that mr bayss politics were good and sound and that his quondum grace of bucks was out when he pretended to make a jest of them  but in short and raillery apart the prevalency of false reports concerted by five or six dark sophisters has more than once made some of the best and greatest men in the kingdom who but just before were approved applauded admired and cherished by all the lovers of their country become all at once the very hatred and scorn of the rabble which i believe neither ever did or could have happened any where but in england either as to the excess of malice in the inventors or the excess of credulity in the believers and propagators of those false reports for that which makes england the most splenetick country in the universe makes it the chief and residentiary seat of slander for there never was a very splenetick man unless he was a man of an extraordinary understanding but he was at the same time a slanderer and the same virulent humor that causes so many noble britons to hang and poison and drown themselves causes them likewise to do their utmost to murder the reputation of their neighbors and the same humor that in some degree caused the invention of the slander at first causes likewise the propagation of it and the credulity of its believers judge then if in such a country as this even an improbable false report be not a just foundation for a comedy but the report of horners impotency since he himself invented it and prepared the way for it is so highly probable that a man must be very hypercritical who upon that account censures my late most ingenious friend i have a great deal more to say upon this subject but i want time at present  i am etc  to the reverend mr mansell rector of cosgrave sir yours of the   d of the last month came to my hands in due time i had sooner returned you thanks for the favor of it and had sooner congratulated you upon the return of your health upon which so many healths depend and which under god has been so often the cause of the recovery of mine if i had not been engaged in an important business which took up all my hours i likewise return you my hearty thanks for setting the affair between me and my brotherinlaw in a true light though i perceive by what you write that there are persons who continue to believe him but i would fain ask those persons what motive they have to restrain them from doing an unjust or a base thing which i have not in a much greater degree they will say perhaps that they have got a great deal more money than i have but sir is not their getting a great deal a sign of their great love for it and if i have all my life time had but a little do they believe it has proceeded from my incapacity of getting it or from my contempt of it and which is most like to secure any one from doing injustice the love of money or the contempt of it have their purses been more constantly open to the occasions of their friends and acquaintance have they discovered more magnanimous thoughts and more exalted above selfishness have they more understanding to discern their true interest and to know that no man can live happily without living reputably have they had a more liberal education or a more generous conversation i was till five and forty plunged in the conversation of the great world and was every day in company with gentlemen who are universally known to be men of no ordinary merit who wanted no discernment to know me and who have several of them given public proofs of their esteem for me now if i mistake not before the age of forty five the manners of men are unalterably formed for these last fifteen years i have retired from the world and confined my conversation to three or four of my old acquaintance who are publicly known to be men of men of honor and understanding can any reasonable man then believe that i who while i was conversant in the world kept my reputation clear should retire to be a villain in solitude if i refused to answer a demand which my brotherinlaw pretended he had upon me it is because he had no title to any thing from me but his want of it if he had asked me to give him the money which he said i owed him i had certainly given it him but i could not think without indignation that an ungrateful wretch to whom i had endeavored at the expense of my time and interest to do the most important services should pretend to extort it from me by insults and brutality what those services are i shall let you know in my next but i am weary at present and so without doubt are you  i am sir your most humble faithful servant john dennis aug      0 june         to mr    in which are some passages of the life of mr john crown author of sir courtly nice sir i shall now in compliance with the repeated requests you have made to me say something concerning the education of mr john crown and the most remarkable passages of his life mr crown was bred under his father an independent minister in that part of northern america which is called nova scotia but the vivacity of his genius made him soon grow impatient of that sullen and gloomy education and soon obliged him to get loose from it and seek his fortune in england but it was his fate at his first arrival here to happen on an employment more formal if possible than his american education his necessity upon his first arrival here obliged him to become a gentleman usher to an old independent lady but he soon grew as weary of that precise office as he had been before of the discipline of nova scotia one would think that these were but indifferent preparatives to the commencing polite author but neither these nor his poverty which was great could oppress his aspiring spirit aspiring to reputation and distinction rather than to fortune and power his writings soon made him known to the court and town yet it was neither to the favor of the court nor of wilmot lord rochester one of the shining ornaments of it that he was indebted for the nomination which the king made of him for the writing the mask of calypso but to the malice of that noble lord who designed by that preference to mortify mr dryden upon the breaking out of the two parties after the discovery of the popish plot the favor that he was in at court the gayety of his youth and his being unacquainted with true political principles engaged him to embrace the party of the tories about that time he writ the city politics on purpose to satyrize and expose the whigs a comedy so agreeable that it deserved to be writ in a much better cause but after he had writ it he met with very great difficulties in the getting it acted bennet lord arlington who was then lord chamberlain of the kings household and who had secretly espoused the whigs who were at that time powerful in parliament in order to support himself against the favor and power of the lord treasurer danby who was his declared enemy used all his authority to suppress it one while it was prohibited on the account of its being dangerous another while it was laid aside on the pretense of its being flat and insipid till mr crown at last was forced to have recourse to the king himself and to engage him to give his absolute command to the lord chamberlain for the acting of it which command the king was pleased to give in his own person for that monarch loved a comedy above all things excepting one thing and had no mean opinion of mr crowns qualifications to succeed in it while he was thus in favor with the king and the court i have more than once heard him say that though he had a sincere affection for the king he had yet a mortal aversion to the court the promise of a sum of money made him sometimes appear there to solicit the payment of it but as soon as he had got it he vanished and continued a long time absent from it of which he told me the duchess of portsmouth took once occasion to complain to the king whose way of answering that complaint puts me in mind of a passage in boileaus epistle to lamoignon  hier de vous on parla chez le roy et d attentat horrible on traita la satire et le roy que dit il le roy se prit a rire it was at the very latter end of king charless reign that mr crown being tired with the fatigue of writing and shocked by the uncertainty of theatrical success and desirous to shelter himself from the resentments of those numerous enemies which he had made by his city politics made his application immediately to the king himself and desired his majesty to establish him in some office that might be a security to him for life the king had the goodness to assure him he should have an office but added that he would first see another comedy mr crown endeavoring to excuse himself by telling the king that he plotted slowly and awkwardly the king replied that he would help him to a plot and so put into his hands the spanish comedy called non pued esser mr crown was obliged immediately to go to work upon it but after he had writ three acts of it found to his surprise that the spanish play had some time before been translated and acted and damned under the title of tarugos wiles or the coffeehouse yet supported by the kings command he went boldly on and finished it and here see the influence of a royal encouragement  mr crown who had once before obliged the commonwealth of learning with a very agreeable comedy in his city politics yet in sir courtly nice went far beyond it and infinitely surpassed himself for though there is something in the part of crack which borders upon farce the spanish author alone must answer for that for mr crown could not omit the part of crack that is of tarugo and the spanish farce depending upon it without a downright affront to the king who had given him that play for his groundwork but all that is of english growth in sir courtly nice is admirable for though we find in it neither the fine designing of ben johnson nor the general and masculine satyr of wycherly nor that grace that delicacy nor that courtly air which make the charms of etherege yet is the dialogue so lively and so spirited and so attractively diversified and adapted to the several characters four of those characters are so entirely new yet so general and so important are drawn so truly and so graphically and opposed to each other surly to sir courtly and hothead to testimony with such a strong and entire opposition those extremes of behavior the one of which is the grievance and the other the plague of society and conversation excessive ceremony on one side and on the other side rudeness and brutality are so finely exposed in surly and sir courtly and those divisions and animosities in the two great parties of england which have so long disturbed the public quiet and undermined the public interest are so happily represented and ridiculed in testimony and hothead that though i have more than twenty times read over this charming comedy yet i have always read it not only with delight but rapture and it is my opinion that the greatest comic poet that ever lived in any age might have been proud to have been the author of it  the play was now just ready to appear to the world and as every one that had seen it rehearsed was highly pleased with it every one who had heard of it was big with the expectation of it and mr crown was delighted with the flattering hope of being made happy for the rest of his life by the performance of the kings promise when upon the very last day of the rehearsal he met cave underhill coming from the playhouse as he himself was going toward it upon which the poet reprimanding the player for neglecting so considerable a part as he had in the comedy and neglecting it on a day of so much consequence as the very last day of rehearsal oh lord sir says underhill we are all undone wherefore says mr crown is the playhouse on fire the whole nation replys the player will quickly be so for the king is dead at the hearing which dismal words the author was little better for he who but the moment before was ravished with the thought of the pleasure which he was about to give to his king and of the favors which he was afterward to receive from him this moment found to his unspeakable sorrow that his royal patron was gone for ever and with him all his hopes the king indeed revived from his apoplectick fit but three days after dyed and mr crown by his death was replungd in the deepest melancholy  thus sir have i given you a short account of the education of mr john crown and of the most remarkable circumstances of his life to the death of king charles the second i shall as soon as i have opportunity continue this relation from the death of king charles to the death of mr crown  i am sir your etc  to his grace the duke of buckingham my lord not being able to wait on your grace by reason of an intolerable headache i humbly desire that you would order the letter which you have done me the honor to write for me to be delivered to the bearer  i humbly desire your grace to believe that if you had given me no caution i had by no means done any thing which might cause me to forfeit your good opinion of me so far were my thoughts from that that i never yet resolved to publish those remarks it is very likely that after your grace and my lord hallifax and two or three more have perused them i may send them to the author and content my self with letting him know my power  but my lord as i would not be thought to do a barbarous thing i desire your grace to believe that i had powerful motives to engage me to write these remarks i was attacked in the  in the very second or third and in several others since your grace is of opinion that the author of the tragedy did not write those particular papers i am very willing to believe it but he was in partnership with those who did he went share in the profits and more than share in the reputation and mr  durst not have provoked me without his approbation or at least his consent my lord with submission to your graces judgment i am apt to believe that what mr  did in this case was the action of mr  if a man who is in partnership wrongs me in trade all the partners are involved in the guilt unless they disclaim it and signify their abhorrence of it to the person injured the law of england allows of no accessaries in murder all who are concerned in it are principals and reason upon which the law of england is founded says that the case is the same in the assassinating a mans reputation my lord i appeal to your grace if the attacking me in the  was not only an assassination but one of the blackest sort it was done in the dark no provocation in the least given no name to the paper and no author known when at the very same time they openly professed friendship to me i may add to this that it was done at a time when they basely took advantage of the great misfortunes i lay under my lord i appeal to your grace if mine is not a more generous proceeding i do not attack but retort i proceed frankly and openly and i who am in adversity engage one who is in high prosperity  yet after all my lord the satyr of this criticism for reason is the severest satyr in the world when it is terribly against a man does not fall most heavily upon the author of the tragedy it falls most severely upon this partial and tastless town the writing a foolish play is a piece of ridicule that we have long been used to but the gaining a general violent applause to a foolish play is something new to us it is the reviving a farce that had been acted but once before since king charles the seconds time  my lord i am afraid of tiring your graces patience by too long a letter or i would proceed to the other motives which prevailed upon me to write these remarks but i hope to have the honor of acquainting you with them another time  i am my lord your graces etc whitehall june         to mrs    written upon the news of the landing of the pretender madam i have lately read over the famous process between the marquis de gueores and mademoiselle de mascranny with which i have been agreeably entertained and which i here send you by the bearer because a lady of your apprehension may easily discern that you may produce an argument from it sufficient to convert your friend mrs  that termagant stickler for divine unalienable indefeasible right for can there be any right to any government so divine so unalienable so indefeasible as that of a husband to the government of his wife yet if this monarch by right divine appears unqualifyd to govern her well if he cannot answer the ends of government if he keeps not the original contract which is on his part the giving due benevolence she endeavors to depose her sovereign immediately that is she sues out a bill of divorce and chooses another king the original contract between a limited monarch and a free people is that he shall govern them by laws of their own making and that they shall obey him as long as they are so governed now will your friend mrs  murmur at our sexes enjoying that privilege which you have always claimed your selves we have already deposed one popish king for breaking this originnl contract and can she expect that we will set up another who we know is not able to keep it would she accept of one for a husband whom she knew beforehand to be in a state of impotence how then can she pretend that we should accept of such a governor is not a popish pretender as much unqualifyd to govern a freeborn protestant people as one in a natural state of impotence is to give due benevolence are not both pretenders equally impotent as to what they pretend to then pray madam acquaint your friend mrs  that since our sex is assistant to yours in throwing off your evil governors when you find upon heartbreaking disappointments that you cannot be happy under them it is altogether unreasonable in her to pretend that we ought to establish any one ruler over us who is utterly incapable of rendering his subjects happy desire her to lay aside her notions of divine right and arbitrary power she wrongs her self and her whole sex by these fantastical opinions no power on earth but that of beauty can justly pretend to right divine for beauty has its power from nature and consequently from god  i am madam yours etc london jan  0       to judas iscariot esquire on the present state of the stage sir i have been about to write to you every post for these ten days but one accident or other has still diverted me but i shall now make more than amends for ingentem tibi epistolam impingam  if i had had the greatest inclination imaginable to accept of the invitation which you sent me by your familiar yet something has happened which would have been a just though a ridiculous impediment for i had given my word to go another way in order to pull a certain beast out of a ditch who had fallen into it through a more than bestial stupidity which engaged him to look upon things above him instead of grazing and following the instinct of nature but to speak plain english and return to your invitation who could have expected any such thing from one who had so barbarously abandoned his old acquaintance who had never so much as once in twenty years missed an opportunity of serving him and abandoned him contrary both to friendship and politics for a man who deserts his friend in an affair in which it is reasonable that he should espouse him does two things at once to his own disadvantage for first he shows the world that he has no bodys interest at heart but his own which indifference the world as soon as it perceives it will be sure to return in kind secondly he gives a pretty convincing proof that he has not capacity enough to understand his own interest for he who in any point that is reasonable is deaf to his friends interest is certainly blind to his own now what dependence can i have on a person who makes it evident to me that he neither cares for my interest nor understands his own if you had laid aside the alteration of coriolanus for better plays there had been a plausible apology for your breach of promise but to sacrifice me to fools was impudent as twas barbarous i have read the noble stuff which you have acted this winter all but busiris which was not published when i left the town but some persons whom i have seen in this place tell me there is a rape in it if that is true it has a fault in it for which nothing can make atonement a rape is the peculiar barbarity of our english stage neither greecians nor romans would suffer it nor can the french at present bear it the very apprehension of a rape though the thing did not follow it damned the theodore of corneille which if you will believe monsieur hedelin is one of his best tragedies i would fain know from you who have had a twenty years experience of the stage for what reason the women who will sit as quietly and passively at the relation of a rape in a tragedy as if they thought that ravishing gave them a pleasure for which they have a just apology will start and flinch like unbackd fillies at the least approach of rem to re in comedy unless that approach happens to be made in the house of bondage i have been sometimes apt to entertain a suspicion that it is not the luscious matter which disturbs them in comedy but the secret implicit satire upon the sex for a woman in comedy never grants the last favor to one to whom she is not married but it proclains the mans triumph and her shame it always shows her weakness and often her inconstancy and sometimes her fraud and perfidiousness but a rape in tragedy is a panegyric upon the sex for there the woman has all the advantage of the man for she is supposed to remain innocent and to be pleased without her consent while the man who is accounted a damned villain proclaims the power of female charms which have the force to drive him to so horrid a violence but to return to the other plays which you acted this last winter i have read two comedies without one jest in them but you will say perhaps that the playhouse was thronged for eight or ten days together at the representation of these comedies perhaps so but then if it was so thronged at the representation of damned plays i hope my ears will no more be stunned with the noise of the improvement of a general taste and that for the future no consequence will be drawn from the numbers of an audience to their capacity for the very same reason that the builders trade the carpenters and the joyners are so very much improved for the very same reason that so many fine houses so many beautiful streets so many stately squares and as it were whole towns are building in your northwest suburbs for that very same reason is your theater crowded a penetration that comes far short of conjuration may suffice to show that the numbers of the nobility and gentry of the town and consequently of their dependants are exceedingly augmented by some great events which have happened of late years viz the revolution the union with scotland the return of our armies from the continent and the kings accession to the crown but as for the improvement of a general taste it is so great a blunder that it could never be thought of among considerate people it is improved indeed with a vengeance it is refined in a glorious manner improved as the taste of a green sickness girl who leaves palatable meat for charcoal refined as the taste of an hysteric woman who is cherished by a stink and sickens at a perfume or as the taste of a modern letcher who like a swine prefers a sirreverence to the finest thing in the world the ingenious diversions which they followed this winter their masquerades their italian farces and their french tumblings cannot choose but show the great refinement of their taste if the general taste were improved two things would certainly follow good plays would be writ and damned ones would not be endured but shakespeares plays you will say were crowded and tom durfeys neglected this winter be it so i shall show you in my next that the generality of an audience in spite of their practice have it both in their heads and their hearts to value tom durfey and to despise shakespeare  i am your etc hampton court april        letter written in behalf of one who was lately ruined by stockjobbing to his fatherinlaw who would not see him sir this is the third letter which i have writ to you without the satisfaction of receiving an answer which has been a great accession to the calamity which i labored under before and i have felt the frowns of fortune the more severely because they have been attended with yours it is hard that it should be in her power to alienate not only our possessions but even the hearts and souls of our dearest and most valued friends as we learn from her hourly inconstancy that there is no man secure from her power methinks it should be the common interest of mankind to alleviate her strokes by using their fellow creatures gently while they are under her disgrace especially since long experience has taught us that she is often the most barbarous to those who deserve her cruelty the least so that her persecution being for the most part directly contrary to reason should least of all be abetted by reasonable men like you my intentions have been very good though the event has not been answerable to them and methinks when we pass a judgment upon our neighbors not by their intentions but by events we pass a severe law against ourselves because our intentions are in our power but events are not and no man can foresee the future my very enemies must confess that my calamity has proceeded not from any extravagance of temper or a luxurious life but only from the too eager desire of getting which if it be a fault who at present is guiltless sure no man ever was justly blamed for catching a distemper whose infection was epidemical and yet that very eager desire of getting has not proceeded from any sordid avarice but only from my excess of love to your daughter and an earnest zeal to secure her happiness before i should be prevented by sickness or death or that usual change which attends on human affairs so that my eagerness to make your daughter happy has been the very thing that has made her miserable by bringing under her fathers displeasure one for whom she believes it her duty to be concerned so that what she suffers by your displeasure causes it to be more grievous to me and makes me more passionately and impatiently desire that you would be reconciled to me my fault has been my error and not my crime and i have youth and health and vigor of mind enough to retrieve my fortune and when i have retrieved her i have reason to believe that she will then be constant to me because i have seen and experienced the only error which could have obliged her to leave me and therefore as soon as i am reestablished i shall be more happy because more secure than if i had never falln in the mean while sir to give you a convincing proof that i prefer your daughters happiness to my own i am willing to do any thing to secure her a competency while my own condition is doubtful i am willing to put it as much out of my power as it is contrary to my inclinations to touch the other two thousand pounds  i am sir your etc june  0    0 to judas iscariot esquire on the degeneracy of the public taste sir about the middle of the last month i sent you a long letter in which i endeavored to show the extravagance of that opinion that there is at this time among us an improvement of the general taste with relation to poetry and the belles lettres and i promised in my next to show the error or the falacy of those who pretend to maintain that opinion from the crowded audiences at the representation of shakespeares plays and the thin ones at those which were writ by mr dy i promised to show that notwithstanding this practice of the present frequenters of the playhouse they have it both in their heads and their hearts to value mr durfey and to despise shakespeare that neither their approbation nor their contempt is their own but assumed and borrowed and that they approve by vogue and by fashion as a late noble poet has told us  their private wish obey the public voice twixt good and bad whimsey decides not choice fashions grow up for taste at forms they strike they know what they would have not what they like i promised to show that the one of these authors has been esteemed and the other contemned by men of sense so long that the approbation of the one and the contempt of the other is come at last to make an impression on the rabble when i mention that word i do not mean such a rabble as you have sometimes on the stage at julius caesar or at coriolanus but such a rabble as is but too often beheld in your pit and sideboxes  a very great part of those who pretend to be in love with shakespeare if he were now living and his most celebrated plays were to be acted de novo without a cabal without character or prepossession would hiss and damn the very things of which they are now the fashionable admirers which seems plain to me from this very reason because the modern plays which they most approve of are the very reverse of shakespeares with respect either to his excellencies or his faults  shakespeare is very justly celebrated for the truth and justness of his characters for the beauty of his sentiments for the simplicity and dignity of his dialogue and for his moving the passions powerfully by the mere force of nature but the present spectators of tragedies approve of those most in which the passions are moved least they will endure no modern tragedy in whose principal character love is not the predominant quality now love predominating in the principal character too often falsifies and confounds those characters and by consequence but too often destroys the beauty of the sentiments because no sentiment can be beautiful which is improper in him who speaks it besides there are not three of our modern tragedies which have any thing like those sentiments which abound in shakespeare sentiments which at the same time that they show sagacity and penetration are easy just and natural  the modern readers and spectators of tragedies will endure no tragedy which has the simplicity and naivete of shakespeares dialogue a simplicity wherever the occasion requires it attended with force and dignity and pomp and solemnity instead of that noble and natural dialogue they are for a flatulant style in which the poet puts the change upon himself and speaks almost always himself instead of making his characters speak  but as the readers and spectators of modern tragedies approve of those most which are the very reverse of shakespeares with respect to his beauties and excellencies so they declare very loudly against his faults the faults of shakespeare which are rather those of the age in which he lived are his perpetual rambles and his apparent duplicity in some of his plays or triplicity of action and the frequent breaking the continuity of the scenes the present spectators declare against this in appearance but at the same time approve of this multiplicity of action in some modern plays concealed by a jumble and a confusion which is incomprehensible and altogether unintelligible another of shakespeares faults is the length of time employed in the carrying on his dramatick action the present spectators are extremely shocked at this in a modern tragedy but at the same time approve of those in which the unity of time is preserved by offending all common sense  if a modern poet in one of his tragedies should show any thing like shakespeares rambles should introduce a tragedy upon the stage which should begin in europe and end in asia like the moor of venice that play would be exploded and damned with very great damnation but the modern spectators of tragedies greatly esteem and are fond of those in which the unity of place is preserved sometimes by whimsical comic absurdities and sometimes by dreadful and prodigious extravagancies  from all this i conclude as i said before that the spectators of modern tragedies having the greatest esteem for those which have least of shakespeares excellencies and declaring loudly against his faults would damn shakespeare if living  nor can i believe that several who pretend to be passionate admirers of milton would treat him if living in any other manner for the following reasons  because they are so fond of nothing as of that soft and effeminate rhyme which makes the very reverse of the harmony and of the manly and powerful and noble enthusiasm of milton  because the generality of poets and wits his contemporaries did not esteem him though they were by no means inferior in understanding to his pretended living admirers willmot earl of rochester never so much as mentioned him in his imitation of the tenth satyr of the first book of horace when he came to imitate that passage forte epos acer ut nemo varius ducit instead of milton he names waller and when that noble peer was some years erwards asked by dr burnet since bishop of salisbury for which of the modern poets he had most esteem he answered without the least hesitation for boileau among the french and cowley among the english poets mr rymer in his first book of criticism treated the paradise lost with contempt and the generality of the readers of poetry for twenty years after it was published knew no more of that exalted poem than if it had been writ in arabic mr dryden in his preface before the state of innocence appears to have been the first those gentlemen excepted whose verses are before miltons poem who discovered in so public a manner an extraordinary opinion of miltons extraordinary merit and yet mr dryden at that time knew not half the extent of his excellence as more than twenty years afterward he confessed to me and as is pretty plain from his writing the state of innocence for mr dryden in that poem which is founded on the paradise lost falls so infinitely short of those wonderful qualities by which milton has distinguished that noble poem from all other poems that one of these two things must be granted either that mr dryden knew not the extent of miltons great qualities or that he designed to be a foil to him but they who knew mr dryden know very well that he was not of a temper to design to be a foil to any one  i hope i have said enough to convince you that the approbations and censures of the generality of an audience are derived from sentiments which are not their own and which are the effects of authority and not of reason when men who are and are esteemed persons of more than ordinary judgment have declared themselves from time to time during a century or half a century concerning poems dramatick or others those declarations are the cause that other persons at length being guided by the light which is held out to them fondly imagine that it was kindled by that particle of heavenly fire which they fancy to be within them but the numerous and violent cabals which are formed to support or decry dramatick writings may serve instead of a thousand arguments to convince the most obstinate that there is no such thing as a general taste among us it being absolutely impossible that great numbers of persons of a fine discernment and a true taste should conspire to extol a blockhead at the expense of a noble art at the expense of their own reputation and the reputation of their country and consequently at the exence in a good measure of that counrys power and interest you and your rethren who are the present managers  the playhouse have of late very justly ewn the extremest contempt for the geeral taste pretending to set off damned lays by the glare of new habits which onduct of you the emperors and kings and princes of the drama recalls to my reembrance what boccalin says of some princes of parnassus they had half rud themselves says that merry italian by he expense they had been at to preserve and perfume sirreverences yet still says e the more cost they were at and the more sweets they bestowed upon them the more damnably their conserves stunk in he nostrils of all who had really noses perhaps if you take the word in the most diffusive sense there never was a general good taste for poetry among any people in the world if you except the athenians but there never was so general a one in england as there was in modern france and italy before the opera and some other things debauched it in both those countries  there has not one great poet appeared in france since the beginning of cardinal richlieus ministry but he has been protected and encouraged and his merit as fast as it could spread has been generally acknowledged i wish i could as truly affirm the same thing of england the great qualities of milton were not generally known among his countrymen till the paradise lost had been published more than thirty years but when that admirable poet was among the italians the greatness of his genius was known to them in the very bloom of his youth even thirty years before that incomparable poem was writ witness the epigram of selvaggi an italian poet of which drydens epigram which is under miltons picture is nothing but a paraphrase  graecia maeonidem jactet sibi roma maronem anglia miltonum jactat utrique parem nay salsiki a roman poet sacrifices the very honor of his country that is of modern italy to him by preferring the italian poetry of milton even to that of tasso  cede meles cedat depressa moxeius urna sebetus tassum desinatusque loqui at thamesis victor cunctis ferat altior undas nam per te milto partribus unus erat and giovanni baptista manso a noble neapolitan who had been the intimate friend of tasso and the great patron of marino while they were living gives extraordinary commendations to milton though he was then but a youth among them as appears by his latin verses addressed to that noble italian  ergo ego te clius and magni nomine phoebi manse pater jubeo longum salvere per aevum missus hyperboreo juvenis peregrinus ab axe milton had then been so far from writing the paradise lost that he had never so much as thought of that subject but had at that time determined after his return to england to write an epick poem upon the exploits of arthur and the knights of the round table as appears by the same verses to manso  arthurumque etiam sub terris bella moventem dicam atque invictae sociali federemensae magnanimos heroas and o modo spiritus adsit frangam saxonicas britonum sub mart phalanges thus you see the italians by his juvenile essays discovered the great and growing genius of milton whereas  countrymen knew very little of him even thirty years after he had published among them the noblest poem in the world  but as the general taste of england could be never said to be good it was never so bad as it is at present a certain proof of which is that writings both dramatick and others were never so infamous as they now are and taste and writing always keep pace with each other when shakespeare first appeared among us the generality of his readers and his spectators were much better able to judge of him than they are at present because as he was a very natural writer and they were without prejudice without prepossession and without affectation and without the influence of a coxcomical senseless cabal they were at liberty to receive the impressions which things naturally made on their minds  hampton court may         to sir richard steel declaring the reasons for which i published the two volumes of select works sir i here send you by the bearer several pieces in verse and prose writ formerly by me and lately printed in two volumes but i send them not without a double design on you for first i desire that you would have the goodness to oblige your managers to make me some recompense this winter for the wrong which they did me the last secondly i desire that you will give me leave to say something concerning he pieces contained in these two volumes and more particularly concerning the motive which obliged me to write the chief of them at the first and to publish them lately together which i shall do with pleasure to one who has done so much good in the same cause in which most of them were writ  several of the pieces in verse and prose and three of the plays were writ in the cause of liberty the narrative poems of greater length were all of them written upon great and public occasions and were designed as so many panegyricks upon those illustrious persons whosegreat and heroic actions had made them benefactors to great britain and liberty  it has always been my opinion that a free nation can never be too zealous in maintaining their liberties because we have been taught by too many fatal events that they have at last been often lost by the security and corruptions of those who had for several centuries enjoyed them witness the ancient grecians and romans and the ancient and modern spaniards and french but whenever the liberties of a great nation are in manifest danger there all the several members of it who are not abjectly base will use their utmost efforts in defending them the liberties of great britain have in our own memory been in so much danger that they have been twice in thirty years retrieved from immediate ruin first by the revolution and secondly by the accession of king george to the imperial crown of this island but even now they by no means appear to me to be entirely secured  since the revolution things appear to have been strangely reverst in great britain with regard to liberty in four or five reigns immediately preceding the arrival of king william of immortal memory the court was for arbitrary power and the people appeared strenuous for liberty but since that time the court has for the most part contended for liberty and the people i mean too great a part of them have declared for slavery now if ever we should come to be under a king who would acrifice his protestant dissenting subjects  the highchurch clergy we should uickly see whether the liberties of a naon are most secure when a considerable part of the people who are their natural guardians are resovd to defend or deterind to resign them in the mean time  it must be acknowledged to the imortal honor of the present king that  endeavoring to secure the dissenters om such a treatment in time to come he taking  the most effectual method to imortalize liberty  thus sir have i acquainted you with  only motive of writing the chief of ese poems which was the apprehension had of the danger which the liberties  my country were in and consequently the liberties of the christian world of which ours are the strongest bulwark i wrote them not then as one who espoused a party but as a lover of my country and one zealous to promote the happiness of great britain i have been so far from having any ambitious aims or any sordid views of interest that i have been contented to see several of the public rewards engrossed by some who are lukewarm and by others who are jacobites in whig clothing while i have remained very poor in a very advanced age but one thing indeed i have sometimes been apt to think exceeding hard and that is that these lukewarm persons and these jacobites in whig clothing should be suffered to make use of the power which they have acquired by their falsehood to the utter ruin of one who has behaved himself all along with the utmost sincerity in the noblest cause of liberty  thus sir have i laid before you the motive which engaged me to write the greater part of the pieces which are contained in the two volumes i shall now show you how the same motive obliged me to use my endeavors to preserve them if they should appear worthy of it and consequently to publish them in the two forementioned volumes it was in october      that i desired a bookseller to collect them for me i thought that after so much time had passed since the writing them i should be capable of forming as true a judgment my self of them as any other person whatsoever who has no better judgment in poetical matters than i have or that the precept of horace nonum prematur in annum must be false and vain  upon a very slow and deliberate perusal of them i could not but conclude that with all their faults they were not altogether deprived of that noble fire which alone can make them pleasing nor of that justness and solidity which alone can make them lasting i believed that if they were published together they might be able one day to do some good to the public and no discredit to me  and i was the more encouraged to venture on this publication because sir you may be pleased to remember that they had been favorably received by the most illustrious persons of both parties for their judgment in poetry and their knowledge of the belles lettres by the late earls of godolphin and halifax mr maynwaring and others among the whigs and by the present duke of buckingham and my lord lansdown among the tories and if any temptation could make me vain it would be the favorable opinions of the last two noble persons because as their judgments in matters of poetry are unquestioned they can never be supposed to be partial to one who has all his lifetime appeared very zealous in contrary principles to those of a party which they by some have been supposed to favor my lord lansdown by making me a present so noble as never has been made by a subject to any author now living sufficiently declared that what i had writ had not been altogether displeasing to him and it is to the warm approbation which the duke of buckingham gave to the poem on the battle of blenheim that i owe the honor of being first known to the late illustrious earl of godolphin whose good and great qualities and the benefits which great britain received from his good and his wise administration make me proud to own for the first and greatest of my benefactors  thus sir i found encouragement to preserve these pieces and especially the poems writ in the cause of liberty but i was convinced at the same time that the only way to preserve them would be to publish them together they were in a great many different hands and some of them in the hands of such who were mortal enemies to the cause in which they were written some of them had been very incorrectly printed the very subject which ought to recommend them to all englishmen as well as the harmony without rhyme in several of the poems made some of them for the present less pleasing to above half the readers of poetry some of them that had once appeared with applause seemed to have been forgot for all things of late days have been managed by cabal and party and there seems to have been a conspiracy in the commonwealth of learning among fools of all sorts to exalt folly at the expense of commonsense and make stupidity triumph over merit in the very dominions of wit which has been one of the causes why things are reduced to that deplorable state upon our british parnassus apollo and the muses seem to have abandoned it disdaining that their divinities should honor a place with their songs where fools and pedants buffoons eunuchs and tumblers have so often met with applause  who could have thought if he had been told twenty years ago that he should outlive tragedy and comedy that he had been promised a life of not quite twenty years yet it is very plain that the promise had extended no further such is the power of cabal and party  i have all along had a great aversion to the making a party or the entering into a cabal and have sometimes looked upon it with horror and sometimes with contempt who that has commonsense can forbear laughing when he sees a parcel of fellows who call themselves wits sit in combination round a coffee table as sharpers do round a hazard table to trick honest gentlemen into an approbation of their works and bubble them of their understandings  and yet i have all along known that nothing in the greater poetry can grow immediately popular without a cabal or party i have a long time been convinced that the more sublimely any thing is writ in poetry and the nearer it comes to perfection the longer it will be before it grows popular without such a cabal because the more sublimely it is writ and the nearer it comes to perfection the more it is raised above the apprehensions of the vulgar and yet notwithstanding this knowledge i have all along resolved to have no reputation or to owe it to my writings  thus sir you see the reasons why the writings that make up these two volumes or at least the greater part of them had been in danger of being lost if i had not taken pains during my lifetime to correct and publish them together there is one more reason remaining and that is the malice of those people whom the world calls poets whose hatred i have been proud to incur by speaking bold and necessary truths in the behalf of a noble art which they have miserably abused by their vile poems and their more vile criticisms and yet it is from these people that the foolish readers of poetry which are nine parts in ten take their opinions of poets and their works little believing or once imagining that these persons are of all mankind the very worst qualified to judge of their own art as having neither the capacity nor the impartiality which are requisite for the judging truly for it will be found generally speaking that poets painters and musicians are capacitated less than other men to judge of poetry painting and music this i must confess may appear to some to be so bold a paradox that i shall endeavor to make it out both by reason and authority though i know very well at the same time that you can make no doubt of it the generality of poets painters and musicians are such by the mere power of a warm imagination and it is very rarely that a strong imagination and a penetrating judgment are found in the same subject we need go no further than boileau to hear that a celebrated poet is often a contemptible judge  tell excelle a rimer qui juge sottement et tell sest fait par ses verse distinguer par la ville qui jamais du lucain na distingue virgile as for what relates to painters i shall content my self with the citation of a remark from the ingenious and judicious author of the observations upon fresnoys art of painting translated by mr dryden it is the fiftieth remark upon these words of mr drydens translation as being the sovereign judge of his own art  this word sovereign judge or arbiter of his own art presupposes a painter to be fully instructed in all the parts of painting so that being set as it were above his art he may be the master and sovereign of it which is no easy matter those of that profession are so seldom endowed with that supreme capacity that few of them arrive to be good judges of painting and i should many times make more account of their judgment who are men of sense and yet have never touched a pencil than of the opinion which is given by the greatest part of painters all painters therefore may be called arbiters of their own art but to be sovereign arbiters belongs only to knowing painters  what is said by this ingenious gentleman of painters is exactly true of musicians for which i have the opinion of more than one master among them and as to the truth of this observation with relation to poets i have said enough above  but as poets are not capable so neither are they impartial judges i speak of those who are only rhimesters for a great master is for the most part as impartial as he is knowing but for the rest the readers of poetry would do well to consider that if a mistress who is courted by a great many passionate rivals should ask any one of them his opinion of the rest it is ten to one that he would prefer him most whom he esteemed least and whom he believed east capable of getting that mistress from him  thus sir have i acquainted you with the motive which obliged me to write the greater part of these treatises and which afterward engaged me to publish them in the two volumes which you will receive with this i hope i shall not be thought troublesome if in a second letter i say something in particular of the pieces both in verse and prose however these two letters will at least convince you of the good opinion which i have a long time entertained both of your discernment and your impartiality  i am sir your most humble and most obedient servant john dennis sep        to tho sergeant esquire that all stockjobbers are slaves sir i had sooner returned you my thanks for the favor of your last and the good advice in it if i had not entertained some thoughts of waiting on you which i had certainly done before now if it had not been for the reflection that here of late you are scarce any where to be found but in exchangealley and what good christian would go to a place where he is sure to meet the devil at every turn that he takes there not indeed with his infernal equipage his browantlers his saucer eyes his long tail and his cloven feet he wears nothing of all this in exchangealley except sometimes his horns but then i should meet him at every turn in more frightful and more provoking appearances as now in the shape of a roguish leering broker and anon like a ghastly ruined stockjobber sometimes in the shape of a young lady who has lost both the modesty and the natural desire of her sex and sometimes i should see him in the same shape in which he fell from heaven that is like a star of the first magnitude shining in an azure sky for that old gentleman who understands his interest better than any mortal living frequents no one spot on the globe so much as exchangealley for there he constantly finds new occasion to exercise his old talents his tempting lying deluding and betraying  i showed the acclamation at the latter end of your letter to a friend who was with me when it came vive la mer pacifique what says he does this come from a sharper i desired to know what made him ask that question you know said he that there are two constant hazard tables or wheels of fortune that are established by authority in this wicked town not to mention a third which is sometimes at guild hall but transitory and occasional that one of these two is in the neighborhood of white hall established by the authority of the court and the other near the royal exchange established by another authority now the table in the neighborhood of white hall is a fair and impartial one at which only men of honor play at least they are men of honor while they are there whatever they may be when they are in other places but the hazard table near the exchange is frequented by the greatest sharpers about this tricking town there are bullies to be seen every day in crowds with their boxes and their false dice sometimes they make use of high runners sometimes of low runners and sometimes of doctors and this their sharping and their cheating is christened forsooth their being in the secret so that being in the secret will shortly come to signify something more scandalous even than open infamy  well but said i even at that tricking table my friend plays upon the square and is in no secret but then said he let me ask you another question is your friend a lover of his country that is a stranger question than the other said i every one is a lover of his country or at least every one pretends to be so but replied he can any one who would be so much as thought to love his country approve so heartily of a method which if it is practiced much longer will infallibly ruin it for besides that strangers run away with vast sums of our money who came in at seventy perhaps and go out at seven hundred is not our trade by this stockjobbing brought to a narrower compass they who are ruined by it are unable to carry on their commerce and they who have gained vast sums by it have been apt to think themselves above their professions and laugh at the getting ten or twenty per cent by a long voyage when in exchangealley they can propose to gain fifty per cent in a morning now as our trade decreases continued he our seamen must decrease proportionably so that at last perhaps it will be impossible upon an exigence to man our royal navy and then we may happen to become a prey to the first invader so that this lover of his country is heartily approving of a method which may one day bring this island to be a conquered province and his own posterity to be wretched slaves as soon as i perceived that he paused i told him that this would have been more a propos if he had spoke it before the late act of parliament for the putting down of the bubbles but he answered they being put down by the wisdom of the legislature for this very reason least any prejudice should acrue to trade from them and rams and onslows bubbles being established by the same wisdom have not the legislature plainly declared that trade could receive no damage from them and that we may deliver to the winds our fears of conquest and of slavery ought not every one to acquiesce in what they have done and can any one be extravagant enough to believe that they would establish two bubbles against the public good only for the sake of a little transitory pelf which is to come into particular hands very good said my friend but are not those gentlemen who constantly frequent exchangeally actually slaves already as errant as vile as miserable slaves as those who row in the galleys say thou so my dear friend said i do but make that out and thou shall to me be apollo and all the muses but this is a new paradox not so new neither said he the whole sect of the stoics embraced it the stoics i told him were fantastical people in some things he allowed they were so but that for the most part their morality was more sound han that of any other sect among he heathens horace who was of no sect but who took from each of them what he thought was just and solid and by the way he wanted no judgment no discernment that could enable him to make a right choice made this opinion is own as you may see by the sixteenth epistle of his first book  qui melior servo qui liberior sit avarus non video nam qui cupiet metuet quoque porro qui metuens vivet liber mibi non erit unquam but my dear friend said i the authority of a roman poet will hardly bring the gentlemen in exchangealley off from their stockjobbing this is an authority he replied which carries reason along with it for thus he argues the covetous man desires he who desires of consequence fears but he who lives in continual fear must in my opinion be always an errant slave but continued he i will add my own reasons to those of horace there are two sorts of liberties said he a civil and a philosophical liberty what we call civil liberty gives us the command of our own actions what we call philosophical liberty gives us the command of our own thoughts now neither the galleyslave nor the stockjobbe can be said to enjoy civil liberty that is neither the one nor the other has the freedom of his own actions for a galleyslave must row and a stockjobber must stockjobb and it signifies nothing to the purpose that the one upon his refusal or upon his neglect is corrected by a cat of ninetayls and the other by the stings of his own base passion since they are both equally under compulsion and the stockjobber though never so wealthy is as much afraid of missing the hours of jonathans or of garroways as the poor galleyslave is of being wanting to his turn at the oar but now to come to philosophical liberty in that the galleyslave has infinitely he advantage of the stockjobber for while the former is chained to his oar his thoughts may be as free as the air his thoughts may wander over the universe may wander through eternity and while his body is in the utmost agitation his mind may be calm and composed but e stockjobbers thoughts are more conind than the others body confined to dirt and the sordid means of accumulang it and his mind is often plagued by he most tormentiug passions the poor galleyslave may be a virtuous and an exellent man but the wealthy stockjobber must always be in the number of proligate sinners  perdidit arma locum virtutis deseruit qui semper in augenda festinat and obruitur re ep    lib   that is he who has his thoughts inent upon the means of heaping up moey has thrown away his buckler has deserted his post the noble post of virtue where his general placed him and which it was his duty to maintain at the expense of life it self he has lost it he has been beaten out of it by his base passions and by his abject vices by his fraud his desire his hope his fear and his rage the galleyslave may have it firmly in his mind and in his will to do all the duties of the best of men to be a faithful lover of his country and to serve it to the utmost of his power to be a good father a good son a good husband a good brother he may be dear to all his friends and relations and have the heartiest kindest wishes of all but as the miserable stockjobber cares only for himself he is dear to himself alone and contemptible and hateful to all besides and one may say to him in the words of horace  non uxor salvum te vult non filius omnes vicini oderunt noti pueri atque puellae miraris quum tu argento post omnia ponas si nemo praestet quem non merearis amorem for a true stockjobber will sacrifice wife father child brother and his country it self for gain he who sacrifice the latter will sacrifice the rest and have we not a thousand instances every day that a stockjobber will sacrifice his country  but there is still another thing in which the galleyslave has by much the advantage of the stockjobber the former is a redeemable slave but the latter is in chains for his life fortune or time may release the slaves who are at algiers or tripoli but fortune and time are both the stockjobbers foes length of days will certainly augment his avarice and make his captivity ruder and the more wealth there shall chance to flow in upon him the more will he desire the less will he enjoy and still the more abject a slave will he be to the base lust of gold but my dear friend said i who had heard him hitherto with patience thou certainly believst that thou art in a pulpit for it is there that right or wrong a man has the privilege of talking for an hour without being interrupted sir said he i stand corrected but i did not deserve this remonstrance only for complying with your own desire you know very well that it is not my custom to talk all and that i have more than once suffered you to preach in your turn no man he continued has a worse opinion than i have of an eternal talker that which makes him so insufferable is that though he is for the most part a very empty coxcomb yet he implicitly declares that into what company soever he lights he alone has more understanding than all the rest of the company together that nature has qualified him to prescribe to others and that god who made him created him perpetual dictator but as i know you continued he to be sometimes an errant wag with a very grave countenance i am perhaps very much in the wrong to take what you say seriously i leave you to ruminate on what i have told you and shall expect to know your opinion of it the next time i see you so we parted but before i give him my opinion i desire to know yours  i am sir your etc white hall june       0 to sir richard steel patentee of the theater in drury lane sir though at the time of writing this i am almost overwhelmed both with sickness and grief yet i cannot forbear making a just complaint to you for your being the occasion of both these either by actually breaking your word with me or being perfectly passive while your managers broke it which if it has not reduced me to immediate necessity yet has brought me within the danger of it and consequently within the apprehension of it which is as grievous almost as the thing and that this complaint is but too justly grounded you your self will acknowledge when i have laid my case before you which i shall do in as few words as i can  it was upon the   th of february       that i received a letter from mr booth by your direction and the direction of the managers under you desiring me to dine at your house on the   th and after dinner to read the tragedy of coriolanus to you which i had altered from shakespeare you cannot but remember sir that upon reading it the play with the alterations was approved of nay and warmly approved of by your self mr cibber and mr booth the other manager was not there and that resolutions were taken for the acting it in the beginning of this winter now i appeal to your self if any dramatick performance could be more seasonable in the beginning of a winter when we were threatened with an invasion from sweden on the north and from spain on the west than a tragedy whose moral is thus expressed in the last lines of the play   they who through ambition or revenge or impious interest join with foreign foes to oppress or to destroy their native country shall find like coriolanus soon or late from their perfidious foreign friends their fate i am sure sir i need not tell one of your understanding that this moral is so apparently the foundation of the dramatick action and must appear to every spectator and reader to be so truly the genuine result of it that if i had not said one word of it every reader and spectator would have been able to have suggested so much to himself  well sir when the winter came on what was done by your deputies why instead of keeping their word with me they spent above two months of the season in getting up all for love or the world well lost a play which has indeed a noble first act an act which ends with a scene becoming of the dignity of the tragic stage but if horace had been now alive and been either a reader or spectator of that entertainment he would have passed his old sentence upon the author  infelix operis summa quia ponere totum nesciet for was ever any thing so pernicious so immoral so criminal as the design of that play i have mentioned the title of it give me leave to set before you the two last lines  and fame to late posterity shall tell no lovers lived so great or died so well and this encomium of the conduct and the death of anthony and cleopatra a conduct so immoral and a selfmurder so criminal is to give it more force put into the mouth of the high priest of isis though that priest could not but know that what he thus commended would cause immediately the utter destruction of his country and make it become a conquered and a roman province certainly never could the design of an author square more exactly with the design of white hall at the time when it was written which was by debauching the people absolutely to enslave them  for pray sir what do the title and the two last lines of this play amount to in plain english why to this that if any person of quality or other shall turn away his wife his young affectionate virtuous charming wife for all these octavia was to take to his bed a loose abandoned prostitute and shall in her arms exhaust his patrimony destroy his health emasculate his mind and lose his reputation and all his friends why all this is well and greatly done his ruin is his commendation and if afterward in despair he either hangs or drowns himself or goes out of the world like a rat with a dose of arsenick or sublimate why it is a great and an envied fate he dies nobly and heroically it is sir with extreme reluctance that i have said all this for i would not be thought to affront the memory of mr dryden for whose extraordinary qualities no man has a greater veneration than my self but that all considerations ought to give place to the public good is a truth of which you of all men i am sure can never doubt  and can you believe then after having recommended virtue and public spirit for so many years to the world that you can give your subalterns authority to preach up adultery to a town which stands so little in need of their doctrine is not the chastity of the marriage bed one of the chief incendiaries of public spirit and the frequency of adulteries one of the chief extinguishers of it according to that of horace  foecunda culpae secula nuptias primum inquinavere and genus and domos hoc font derivata clades in patriam populumque fluxit for when adulterys become so frequent especially among persons of condition upon whose sentiments all public spirit chiefly depends that a great many husbands begin to believe or perhaps but to suspect that they who are called their children are not their own i appeal to you sir if that belief or that suspicion must not exceedingly cool their zeal for the welfare of those children and consequently for the welfare of posterity  as i had infinitely the advantage of all for love in the moral of coriolanus i had it by consequence in the whole tragedy for the coriolanus as i have altered it having a just moral and by consequence at the bottom a general and allegorical action and universal and allegorical characters and for that very reason a fable is therefore a true tragedy if it be not a just and a regular one but it is as just and as regular as i could make it upon so irregular a plan as shakespeares whereas all for love having no moral and consequently no general and allegorical action nor general and allegorical characters can for that reason have no fable and therefore can be no tragedy it is indeed only a particular account of what happened formerly to anthony and cleopatra and a most pernicious amusement  and as i had the advantage in the merit of coriolanus i had it likewise in the worlds opinion of the merit and reputation of shakespeare in tragedy above that of mr dryden for let mr drydens genius for tragedy be what it will he has more than once publicly owned that it was much inferior to shakespeares and particularly in those two remarkable lines in his prologue to aurengezebe  and when he hears his godlike romans rage he in a just despair would quit the stage and in the verses to sir godfrey kneller  shakespeare thygift i place before my sight with awe i ask his blessing ere i write with reverence look on his majestic face proud to be less but of his godlike race and the same mr dryden has more than once declared to me that there was something in this very tragedy of coriolanus as it was writ by shakespeare that is truly great and truly roman and i more than once answered him that it had always been my own opinion now i appeal to you and your managers if it has lost any thing under my hands  but what is more considerable than all this your deputy lieutenants for the stage have ten times the opinion of the advantage which shakespeare has over mr dryden in tragedy than either i or the rest of the world have ever since i was capable of reading shakespeare i have always had and have always expressed that veneration for him which is justly his due of which i believe no one can doubt who has read the essay which i published some years ago upon his genius and writings but what they express upon all occasions is not esteem is not admiration but flat idolatry  and lastly i had the advantage of the very opinion which those people had of their own interest in the case they knew very well that it was but twelve years since all for love had been acted and they were likewise satisfied that from its first run as they call to the beginning of this last winter it had never brought four audiences together at the same time there was no occasion to tell them that the coriolanus of shakespeare had not been acted in twenty years and that when it was brought upon the stage twenty years ago it was acted twenty nights together  and now sir i shall be obliged to you if you will acquaint me for what mighty and unknown reason the coriolanus notwithstanding yours and their warm approbation of it notwithstanding your words solemnly given to act it as soon as it could conveniently be brought upon the stage this winter notwithstanding the merit of the play it self i speak of shakespeares part of it notwithstanding the worlds and their own opinion of the superior merit of shakespeare to mr dryden in tragedy and their very opinion of their own interest in the case nay notwithstanding the exact seasonableness of the moral for the service of king george and of great britain which above all things ought to have been considered by those who call themselves the kings servants and who act under his authority i say sir i should be extremely obliged to you if you would tell me what powerful reason could so far prevail over all those i have mentioned as to engage them to postpone the coriolanus not only for all for love but likewise for that lamentable tragic farce caezar borgia from which no body expected any thing but themselves and a comedy after it called the masquerade from which they themselves declared they expected nothing  i am etc march         to mr penkethman i had certainly called upon thee at richmond before now if it had not been for the easterly winds which made the coming by water impracticable to one who is indisposed by reason of the cold attending them but thou have no reason to be concerned at my delay for this is no time to write waggish letters to his grace in the mean while i have thought of a project for thee which will certainly do thy business thou shall even turn author and write a play thou will tell me perhaps that thou art not qualified for that very reason thou shall write one because for that very reason thou will certainly succeed but perhaps thou will tell me that thou shall write a very damned play indeed a stronger reason still for thy writing for the more damnable thy play happens to be the greater and more flaming will thy success be and so like a modern author or a modern female beggar thou shall supply thy own infinite wants by the infinite wants of thy offspring but why art thou not qualified friend pinky there are nowadays but three qualifications requisite for the succeeding upon the stage the first is the want of that same for thou know the belly is ingenii largitor the second qualification is that as modern critics when they come to a new play are never without a catcall a modern poet who writes such a play should never be without a foolcall he must have the knack of jugging fools into a pit as a country squire does partridges into a trammel the third qualification and which is necessary for the enforcing the other two is what they call a stock a very great stock not a stock of silver nor yet of gold but of a metal more powerful than either and which commands them both now upon the foot of these three qualifications who the devil is half so well qualified for the writing a comedy as thou art is it proctor john littlewit or scribble dash the inns of chancery bard or the czars old soldier friend pinky thou art never modest but in the wrong place why none of these are worthy to carry thy cloak after thee and hardly worthy to carry thy friend tom s for where as thou art a living breathing comedy they are a leash of dull devils who are tragedy all over their very jests are deep tragedy they never endeavor to make us laugh but they move terror and compassion their very offer at a jest moves terror and it is no sooner out but it moves compassion but as for thee thou have nothing to do but to write a long part for thy self and then if thou have no jest in thy chit chat thou will have a perpetual one in thy person and that will do thy business  i am thy very humble march          to richard norton of southwick esquire sent to him by mr booth when the players went last down to act at his house sir i take this occasion of mr booths going down to southwick to acquaint you that i have been several times to wait on you his summer in bloomsbury with four acts of appius and virginia in obedience to a summons which i received from you by colonel b and i would take this opportunity to wait on you at southwick instead of writing to you if some business of consequence did not absolutely oblige me to be nearer the town but as soon as ever i have finished this tragedy appius shall wait upon you in my stead you sir have been always one of those whom i have been proud to please but it would give me a very particular satisfaction to find this tragedy which was written in the cause of liberty agreeable to one who has always shown himself so good a patriot and so great a judge i make no doubt sir but that you do me the justice to believe that though fortune denies me the happiness of going down to southwick my heart and soul will be there if we had not a more than common esteem and respect for you we should certainly envy you for drawing down into the country the noblest diversion of the town nature has combined with fortune to make you completely happy you have it in your power and you have it in your will to set before your eyes even in the midst of solitude the most agreeable conversation both of the court and town and to join the reasonable delights of these with the sweets of your own charming retirement thus you enjoy the town in your absence from it free from the plagues that allay the delights of it here and those fools and knaves that are always in our way to perplex us and disturb us here appear at southwick only to give you joy while the calamities of courts and the follies and villainies of great towns set before you recommend the security the charms and the innocence of so sweet a retreat the more to you while most of the people of great quality and of great estates entertain their neighbors and their acquaintance either with unprofitable empty amusements or with pernicious diversions which drown their understandings and debase their souls you please them with the noble delights of reason such as rightly made use of will enlarge their understandings direct their wills and exalt their minds good god how must they blush who spend great estates or at least the incomes of them in turning men into beasts while you with all the economy of conduct have the satisfaction of improving beasts into men as all men who are capable of thinking right approve the judgment of your choice so we who are passionate friends to the stage think it our duty to return you thanks for the timing it for at the very time that several persons of the greatest quality and the greatest interest have been endeavoring to banish the drama from this town and island and to introduce instead of it an effeminate music to emasculate the minds of men to metamorphose the british nation and with songs like those of the sirens to change our very kinds you have generously made choice of that very time to appear the great encourager of the dramatick muses and to afford them a refuge and a retreat so charming that while they are at southwick they may not regret parnassus so generous a proceeding has obliged all the hearty friends to the stage and has added one more sensible obligation to those which you have been formerly pleased to confer upon  sir your most humble and most obedient servant john dennis london aug  0   0  to the right honorable the earl of godophin lord high treasurer of great britain concerning the proposal for the security of commerce my lord i have here the honor to send your lordship the abstract of that proposal which i laid before you about the middle of the last sessions of parliament i did not think fit to remind your lordship of it before because though you might have approved of it it was then too late for the parliament to go through it and besides i had some apprehension that that parliament would not enter into it  my lord at present i humbly conceive with all imaginable submission to your lordships judgment that the bringing this proposal to practice would be highly convenient and perhaps necessary absolutely necessary if the war is like to be of any long continuance and highly convenient though it should be like to have a speedy end because in this last case i humbly conceive that we should have a better and more solid peace than we should have without it for nothing with submission to your lordships judgment would more alarm the french than the reducing this proposal to practice for since they have but two ways of succeeding in their designs against these nations which are the dividing us at home and the ruining our commerce abroad they would lose the very hope of success if they should see themselves prevented in both to which the bringing this proposal to practice would contribute not a little i have been told by so many understanding people that the general insurance which is a part of this proposal would bring in such considerable sums into the exchequer as would make it equivalent to almost any other tax that i can hardly doubt of it my lord i humbly conceive that it would have some advantages above all other taxes for as far as i am able to make a judgment upon a four years scrutiny it is a tax that is very much desired even after so long a war and which is remarkable it is most earnestly desired by those who are to pay the money because by this tax something would be done for them preferably to the the rest of the people which cannot be said of any other tax and whereas perhaps by all other taxes both trade and the ordinary constant revenue are considerably diminished they would not only be both improved and augmented by this but the national stock increased and the whole confederacy strengthened and bound indissolubly i shall have the honor of waiting on your lordship suddenly to know your pleasure in this affair if your lordship encourages me to lay this proposal before the house of commons i shall prepare an appendix by which i believe i can satisfy that honorable house that the advantages mentioned both in the proposal at large and in the abstract will really accrue to us from putting that design in practice  i am my lord your lordships etc june  0   0  to mr george sewel on the preface to a comedy called the masquerade sir i have lately read over the preface to a certain comical rhapsody with an odd mixture of laughter and indignation upon which i shall here send you some remarks that were made in a cursory manner he pretends to turn your own canon upon you but he has done it to so fine a purpose that it has recoiled with violence upon himself and quite demolished the paltry works he has raised for what confounded sot will read any thing of an author who is capable of writing such a preface mr dryden tells us in his preface to the medal that upon his writing absalom and achitophel he met with just such adversaries what reflections he makes upon that notable way of proceeding you will find in the foresaid preface but to return to that of our author  he has very little inclination he says to write prefaces because i suppose it is not so easy to steal prefaces as plays however as difficult as it is he has brought it about he has boldly seized upon yours and boasts of it as plunder instead of theft  he neither commends nor defends the play which would be to waste his breath in commending shirly and taverner but he spends his borrowed preface in commending the actors who vouchsafed to be the receivers and venders of his stolen goods his masquerade he says owes all his success to them and here the panegyric which others bestow upon some one substantial patron he is for retailing among a company of actors which he distributes among them at so surprising a rate that not a mortal of them can pretend to any share of it for first the success of this play is owing to the just performance of the players in general then it is particularly owing to the grace which with her usual excellence mrs oldfield gave to her part indeed no one who has had the happiness to know mrs oldfield can in the least doubt of her being qualified whenever she pleases to give extraordinary pleasure by her parts but now to show that fools as well as children are for boys play this person the very next moment resumes the commendation which he so very generously granted to the company in general and so very justly to mrs oldfield in particular and to show his old inclination to arbitrary power pretends to make a fresh grant of it for the sole use of master robert wilks the success of this comedy says he is owing entirely to master robert well i have read many a gross fulsome flattering fool but i never read any one before who was fool enough to own that he flattered grossly and fulsomly for when he tells mr robert wilks that the success of the play is entirely due to him and in the same breath tells the whole company it is due to them and in the same breath tells mrs oldfield that it is very particularly due to her what does he do but laugh in master roberts face and tell him that he takes him for the errantest baby that ever was bit at bobcherry but now to show that this fellow is more fool than knave and that he does not flatter on this occasion so much as he thinks he does and owns that he does i will venture to bring him off a little nay i will venture to show that when he says the success of the play is entirely due to mr robert wilks he does not flatter at all for i have heard a grave bird sing that if it had not been for him alone the masquerade had never een acted the rest of the managers having e last contempt for it some of the layers told a gentleman of my acquainnce that the cause of this authors being master roberts favorite is because he oes carry himself like a true poet to him o not to the rest of the world for in rder to please master robert and entirey to gain his affections he does not fail om time to time to entertain him with ertain quaint inventions with certain inenious fictions while master robert ke other auditors and spectators being willing to be deceived in order to be perfecty pleased supposes all this to be true they dded that master robert was so exceedngly delighted with entertainments of this nature that the other managers paid for is pleasure of this kind very dearly it tanding them in at least five hundred pounds a year i shall tell you things when i see you which are not fit to be writ  i am your etc hampstead march  0       to tho sergeant esquire sir i remember very well that before i went out of town in june last i promised in a short time to give you some account of the late  i make no doubt but that you have long before this time accused me of breach of promise but if you did but know what charming places i have been in since i saw you last and what damnable company for the most part i have kept in them how my life has been checkered between rapture and chagrin and consequently unable to turn it self to business did you but know this i am confident you would not blame me besides i considered that authors as well as pettifoggers ought to have long vacation and that it was but reasonable that the world should once a year enjoy an interval from being plagued with either that it was highly expedient that minds sometimes should lie fallow as well as fields as well as those human bodies which they inform that they who are too often in the act of generation produce but weak and puny offsprings and peradventure none and that the scriblers and common whores of that vile town seldom beget any thing unless something by chance that like a dutch sooterkin is at once frightful and contemptible as all monsters are besides i thought it a duty to my self to recruit those spirits by a pleasing indolence which a long misfortune had almost exhausted and if at any time in spite of these reasonable reflections i resolved to set heartily about the performance of my promise i immediately started at the thought of what i was about to undertake for to make remarks upon this  death and hell a man must read it and who that has quails and burgundy before him would leave them for porter and ram mutton besides the faults in it are so frequent and so gross that every fool may find them and a man cannot value himself or expect that the reasonable part of the world should value him for his sagacity or penetration on the account of exposing them i flatter my self that you who have had a fourteen years experience of my sincerity will believe that i speak my sentiments at least i can assure you that i have taken all imaginable care and have kept the most watchful guard upon my self that i might neither endeavor to deceive you through malice nor be my self deceived through prejudice but since perhaps you or somebody to whom you may show this letter may be of another opinion i shall send you in a day or two some observations upon the first which little may be enough to show all the beast for a lion is not better descried by his claw than an ass is known by his ear  i am sir your etc hanworth sept  0      to tho sergeant esquire sir i wrote to you about a week ago and designed to write again by the next post ut that raskal appius has lately taken  so much of my time that he will not ffer me to be in good humor enough  entertain my friends besides the very house where i am is sanctified to that deree that it is a mortal enemy to gayety nctified to the very names of the persons ho inhabit it the name of the elder on is aminadab of the younger amos of e elder daughter jemina of the second ezia and of the youngest kerenhapch which you know are the names of he three daughters of the most patient man and you may take it on my word that master aminadab and madam kerenhappuch are two very extraordinary perons  in this house you must know sir is  old fanatical pettifogger who has lately married a young wife there being not room enough to receive her here she lives at present with her father in a village about seven miles off and the old pettifogger ambles to her in his gambadoes once a week to pay his natural tax and then literally returns to see his uncle who is the master of the house where we lodge it happened about a month ago that some business obstructed his journey but having procured a barrel of oysters he ordered them with a letter to be sent in his stead the letter was delivered to a marketman who came from the village and he was ordered to go to the stable and to take a sack which he should find there in which the oysters it seems were wrapped which he was ordered to deliver to spouse with the letter in the mean while as the devil would have it another countryman had laid another sack there which the former countryman who knew nothing of the freight took instead of that with the oysters carried it to the village and delivered it to spouse with the letter which was to this effect  my dear business will not permit me to be happy in your embraces tonight but i intend to be with you on monday in the mean time i have sent you something to supply my place with which i hope you will enjoy your self in my absence  your etc   spouse was very well pleased with the letter orders the sack to be immediately opened and greedily pulls out of it  half a dozen bunches of carrots and so you have the piece of rural waggery which i promised you in my last  i am sir your etc newport oct     0  to mr    my good friend i who in town was great as caesar am here reduced to nebuchadnezzar that is i have been for these three weeks at grass with mere white cattle and have not so much as seen three reasonable creatures since i left the neighborhood of whitehall when i arrived at this place i had the mortification to find that of my two landlords in whose houses i had here formerly passed so many delicious hours the one was gone to live at epsom and the other was run quite away upon enquiry i found that there were but two houses to lodge at a common boarding house or my barbers i considered that by going to the common boarding house i should give up a good part of my liberty which is the principal thing that makes the country so charming for there might be women at that house or they might come the very day after me who though old and ugly might expect as much ceremony as if they were young and beautiful now that ceremony which passes hourly among some people is founded like law on a mutual agreement between them to give up part of their natural liberty for the benefit of society but though there is a sort of necessity for an observance of forms and ceremonies in great and capital towns yet when a man retires into the country he is desirous to be for a while at least like the woods and hills which he ranges in the state of nature i must consess that even in great towns i have always had a very indiferent opinion of a great deal of ceremony and have been always apt to beieve that as ubi plurimae leges pessima espublica so where there is the most ceemony there is always the worst socity another reason which inclined me  the barbers was a desire to know he nature of this place for though i ave been ten times here yet as my forer lodgings had the finest meadows and streams in the world behind them  scarce ever came into the village  that till this last arrival i knew noing of the people of cobham of whom  my next i shall give you some account  i am yours cobham ly         to dr    at shrewsbury of ecclesiastical quacks sir i return you thanks for your agreeable relation of the progress of the itinerant doctor who travels it seems like one of those foolish fires which lead people into bogs and ditches whose misfortune it is to come in the way of their false and delusive light upon the receipt of your entertaining letter i made the following queries to some of his gross admirers  whether some people who practice divinity though they are called doctors are not really quacks and whether mountebanks ecclesiastical as well as secular are not distinguished from true professors by the following marks  first whether the true physician both of soul and body is distinguished from the mountebank not by wearing an academical bonnet but by wisdom learning and a long experience in the art of healng and whether he who through want of hese continually mistakes the distemper of is patient and by consequence adminiters poison to him prescribes opiates in  lethargy or brandy in a calenture is not  ridiculous contemptible empirick though  has been dubbed both bachelor and dotor at oxford  secondly whether the true physician oth of soul and body does not consult the aie and design the health of the whole ody politic and the whole body natural  which it is his fortune or duty to admister whereas the quack of both kinds ever fails like the tinker to make two oles while he is employed in mending of e for example the true physician of e body natural purges and cleanses the hole mass of blood in order to the healg an ulcer in the pudenda whereas the mpirick by giving a sudden check to it rows it up into the nobler parts and e spiritual physician of the body polick is for saving every soul of that body  which he happens to be a member hereas the ecclesiastical empirick as if  were the first plenipo of heaven is for ing some and damning others with an solute power  thirdly whether the true physician does not keep his station and confine his practice to his neighborhood whereas folly and imposture by remaining constantly with the same people would suffer too much through too long an inspection and therefore the mountebank finds his account better in being itinerant and when he has cheated the fools of one majoralty both of their health and their money seeks for fresh cullies and fresh idiots in a new corporation  fourthly whether the true and the sound physician is not satisfied with the approbation of his own conscience and of those who have common sense whereas the mountebank makes it his business to be the idol of the rabble and therefore has much more numerous aplauders than the true physician for rabble is a most comprehensive word doctor and includes not only pitiful poor mechanics and wretched rogues in rags but many nay very many persons who are distinguished by fortune and dignified by princes this comprehensive word doctor includes all who want understanding and virtue and so for example the rabble round the wrekin includes not only the butchers the tinkers the weavers and the tailors of the adjacent towns and counties but often likewise too often the mayor the sheriff the alderman and the doctor i mean the mountebank both spiritual and secular for every one who seeks the applause of rabble is himself most certainly rabble but how emphatically doctor are they rabble who are the admirers and the applauders of rabble  thus has your letter drawn queries from me instead of an answer which i hope you will look upon as an equivalent and read with candor and with indulgence as coming from  your etc  to henry cromwell esquire of an expression in shakespeare and of the comedy of the nonjuror sir i wrote to you this morning for your more deliberate opinion concerning the passage of phaedrus i now send this to you to consult you about an expression in the othello of shakespeare which  long ago occasioned a great dispute at  coffeehouse between the wits there and the manager of the playhouse who acts the part of othello the wits asked the player how he liked this expression in his own part excellent wretch to which the latter answered that he liked it so ill that he always left it out upon which they immediately extolled it to the skies and looked upon the player with great contempt though that tragedian has no more judgment in tragedy than an ass has in music i am apt to believe that he was this once in the right i know indeed very well that miser and misellus were sometimes among the romans terms of tenderness i find that miser is in that sense in the eunuch of terence act the third scene the last where chaerea gives antipho an account of his enjoying pamphila  chapter edicit ne vir quisquam ad eam adeat et mihi ne ahscedam imperat in interiore part at maneam solus cum sola adnuo terram intuens modeste an miser which madam dacier has translated pauvre garcon but are there not two sorts of tenderness a comic and a tragic tenderness now though miser was sometimes used by the romans to express both the one and the other tenderness yet in my opinion it can never be translated into english by the word wretch in any but the comic way wretch in a serious sense being always if i am not mistaken a term of reproach or contempt and consequently the terms excellent wretch being inconsistent and contradictory make the meaning absurd and the expression nonsense this is my opinion at present but i know not how long it will be so because i have not as yet heard yours  but that is not the only point in which i desire it i am told lately by one of my acquaintance that i have been too severe upon the understanding of another of the managers and that is of cibber and the reason that was given me was that cibber writ the fool in fashion which says my friend you have often said is a good comedy to which i answer that it is true i have often said it is a good comedy but i had always much ado to believe that cibber writ it and that since i have seen the nonjuror and the heroic daughter i do not believe it at all for which i shall give my reasons and afterward desire to know from you how convincing they appear to you  when the fool in fashion was first acted cibber was hardly twenty years of age now could he at the age of twenty write a comedy with a just design distinguished characters and a proper dialogue who now at forty treats us with hibernian sense and hibernian english could he when he was an arrant boy draw a good comedy from his own raw uncultivated head who is now at forty able to do nothing but what is poor and mean when he is supported by two such masters as moliere and corneille  i have often observed to you that there is not in his heroic daughter one spark of the force and noble spirit of corneille as for moliere i am satisfied that he knows nothing of him but that he built his nonuror upon some spiritless dull translation of him when i heard that a play with that title was to be acted i wished it as much success as cibber did upon account of the cause in which it was writ but i efusd to see it acted because knowing molieres play to be a masterpiece i was fraid i should be asked some questions by my friends which i should not care to anwer i heard an advantageous character of it from some with whom i conversed and what i heard i imparted to others but  coming from my friends and not from my self after the play was printed i would not read it till it had been published  month during which time i was asked a hundred questions about it when i saw that the curiosity of the world was pretty well over i sent for the play and read it upon the reading it i was soon confirmed in some of my former thoughts that persons of a very good understanding might be imposed upon at a representation by the liveliness and grace of action and that the excellence of the actor often makes amends for the imperfections of the author i soon found that there was little in the english comedy of the beauties of moliere for molieres characters in his tartuffe are masterpieces marked distinguished glowing bold touched with a fine yet a daring hand all of them stamped with a double stamp the one from art and the other from nature no phantoms but real persons such as nature produces in all ages and custom fashions in ours his dialogue too is lively natural graceful easy strong adapted to the occasion adapted to the characters in short it is by this comedy and by the misantrope that moliere perhaps has born away the prize of comedy from all persons in all ages except ben johnson alone but the characters of the english comedy are most of them daubed and bungled and the dialogue nothing but mere fribble now is it barely possible that this bungling imitator can be the author of the fool in fashion is it barely possible that he should have known mankind and the stage and the english tongue when he was an errant boy who is grossly ignorant of them all at forty but cibbers name is prefixed to the fool in fashion they know nothing of mr cibber who in the least wonder at that he who now he is turned of forty sets his name without any manner of scruple or ceremony to what all the world knows was writ by fletcher and dryden could not his vanity when he was a boy prevail upon him to own what an unknown though a very ingenious gentleman writ thus have i given you my reasons why i cannot believe that the fool in fashion was writ by mr cibber but i desire to know as i told you above how convincing these reasons appear to you  i am sir your etc june       0 to mr    sir you desire me to send you some arguments to convert your neighbor from jacobitism who you say is a man of good sense and a good christian and good protestant i have sent you the following queries to present to him and am of the opinion that if he is what you say they may have some influence on him  i whether it is possible that the pretender should be settled here without the subversion of our present constitution and the establishment of absolute power  ii whether the establishment of absolute power under a popish prince will not extirpate the protestant religion from great britain and ireland  iii whether the extirpation of the protestant religion from these islands will not in all human appearance be followed by the utter destruction of it throughout the christian world  iv whether the destruction of the prostant religion throughout the christian world will not in all human appearance  followed by the utter destruction of christianity it self  v whether since these things are sily proved as i my self will undertake to love any of the foresaid consequences  who professes himself a christian and  protestant can have the heart to wish  conscience to promote a design which will be the ruin of that religion on which  believes that all his happiness depends  i am etc ept      to the reverend mr mansell sir the last of july i had the honor to return an answer to your most obliging and ingenious letter i have since had the curiosity to enquire after the priests whom you mention but have been able to get no intelligence from which i conclude that the priests whom you mention must be two or three scandalous jacobite curates in your neighborhood but whatever ill they may say of me i will presume that they do not call me fool which implies all other infamies for as rochefoucault says a fool has not stuff enough to be good i will presume they do not say of me that every word that every action of my life is a contradiction to common honesty and to common sense that though i am most sordidly interested and most ridiculously proud i am endeavoring with might and main to make my self most miserable and most despicable that i am laboring with all my might and with all my strength to bring in a tyrant in order to secure liberty and the pope to secure religion and my spiritual property that i desire and endeavor nothing so vehemently as to bring my wife and children to infamy and beggary and to make of my self either a vile vagabond or an execrable apostate and that i have been all along laboring at this so strenuously that i have made my self a most perjured villain in order to bring it about and scandalous enough to bring fresh disgrace upon a pillory or the whippingpost  these sir are things which i presume they do not say of me because these are encomiums which are only worthy of them and which they have made upon themselves by their actions but because what they  say of me they have in all likelihood from that monster j s i desire that in my next you will give me leave sir to say a word

obliged obedient servant w p april        to sir richard blackmore on two verses in virgil sir i desired in my last that you would be arbitrator in a dispute which i lately had with mr row concerning some verses of virgil the passage is in the  d eclogue  malo me galatea petit lasciva puella et fugit ad salices and se cupit ante videri now sir mr row affirmed that the nymph in acting and the shepherd in relating meant nothing but boys and girls play my opinion is that such an interpretation renders the passage wholly flat and insipid and fit to please none but children that the nymph by throwing the apple and then running away to the willows but at the same time taking care that the shepherd should see her before she got to them designed mans and womans play now sir you are left to judge which of the explications is most worthy of virgil and which comes nearest up to that molle and that facetum which at that time of day composed the character of virgil if we will take the opinion of a very judicious critic and that was his friend horace  molle atque facetum virgilio annuerint gaudentes rure camaenae for where is the molle and the facetum in these verses if the nymph and the shepherd like boys and girls were only at hide and seek i could as soon believe that when silenus in the sixth eclogue says speaking of aegle huic aliud mercedis erit he only intended to present her with a pair of gloves i know indeed very well that ruaeus interprets lasciva by jocosa puella but it ought to be considered that ruaeus was a priest and that the dauphin was young and that it was the business and duty of the jesuit to conceal from his young pupil the lubricity of the poets meaning nor is lasciva used upon this occasion though it is taken in the common sense so very different from jocosa puella if we consider that homer whenever he has occasion to mention venus calls her the laughterloving goddess besides my antagonist does not seem enough to consider either the nature of women in general or of the italian women in particular or of the season when this was supposed to happen which was high spring which is the season of high desire as palaemon gives us to understand a little before this passage in three verses the two last of which are beautiful as their subject  dicite quandoquidem in molli consedimus herba et nunc omnis ager nunc omnis parturit arbos nunc frondent sylvae nunc formosissimus annus now when we consider all these things can we believe that virgil who was so judicious so wise and who followed nature so closely meant nothing but hide and seek by his se cupit ante videri that which makes this one of the beautifullest passages of all the eclogues is that there is a very wanton meaning expressed in very modest words and consequently occasion given to the reader to show his discernment by piercing the veil which the poet has thrown over the nudity which puts me in mind of a fine passage of montaigne essay lih   chapter    the verses of these two poets  meaning lucretius and virgil treating with so much discretion and so much reservedness of lasciviousness as they treat of it do as it were discover more of it and show it in a better and nearer light our ladies cover their breasts with a veil as our priests do their sacred things and painters shadow their finest draughts in order to give them luster they say likewise that the rays of the sun and the strokes of the mind are more forcible by reflection than when they come directly it was a wise answer of the egyptian to him who asked him what do thou carry concealed there under thy cloak i carry it concealed thus under my cloak because thou should not know what it is but there are certain other things that are concealed only on purpose to be shown ovid is a great deal more bold but therefore a great deal weaker than the other two and when he says plainly  et nudam pressi corpus adusque meum methinks he makes an errant capon of me by his barefaced lewdness he who says all satiates and disgusts us whereas he who expresses himself with reserve and caution draws us in to imagine more even than he could have expressed there is as it were treachery in this kind of modesty since it slyly opens so inviting a path to a wanton imagination    thus far montaigne when he speaks of the modesty of lucretius he means i suppose that modesty which he shows in his invocation where indeed in very modest terms he treats of a very wanton subject  i could say more upon this subject but i am afraid that i have already tired you as well as my self  i am etc feb         to walter moyle esquire at bake near loo in cornwall sir twenty tedious years have now been past since i had the honor either to see you or hear from you or write to you though i had many a time done the latter if you had not prevented it by your unkind prohibition when the last time i saw you you declared among a great number of your friends that you would keep correspondendence with no one but though by reason of that unkind declaration we have a long time reckoned you dead and buried to the world and us yet we have been far from forgetting you so very far from it that we have had the more lively remembrance of you because we have seen no body since you left us who by resembling you could put us in mind of you which recalls to my mind something that past at the funeral ceremonies of a great lady in the time of tiberius caesar the images of her ancestors were carried in procession upon that occasion but says tacitus eo praefulgebant cassius at que brutus quod eorum imagines non visebantur  at length after twenty years silence i am obliged to write to you in order to do you service and my self justice d the printer was with me yesterday and had the folly or the impudence to show me a letter from you by which i found that that scoundrel had arrogated to himself the little present which i ordered him to make you last may was twelvemonth and to make it pass for his own act and deed i ordered him to send you the two volumes which he printed for me before they were published and to send them in the large paper which he ought to have done for his own sake because then you would have seen a book very beautifully printed i ordered him likewise to send them as handsomely bound as the skilfullst workman could bind them but upon the bringing in his account i found that that wretch who has not soul enough to do a handsome thing though he is sure it will cost him nothing had sent the common paper without any binding at all  d had as much forgot you before i mentioned you to him as if he had never known you unless by sight and by chance but upon his enquiring whose the anonymous letters were which were printed  one of the two volumes i said enough to him of the author and of the expectation which i had of the translation of dionysius halicarnassaeus to fire his dull mass with the greedy desire of gain  i am interrupted but i shall the very ext post without fail say something to you of that translation and of the preace which is got into the hands of a riend of your brothers and mine who i hope and believe has too much hoour ever to print it without your conent i am obliged to take my leave of ou till the next post in the mean time  desire you to judge of the respect the esteem and affection which i have and ave always had for you since i had first he honor to

sensibly regreted your leaving us sir george markam can tell you something of this and  can mr congreve mr ein and mr welbye but most of the rest alas are vanished like a mornings dream  i am sir your most humble and faithful servant john dennis london jan         0 to tho sergeant esquire sir i have been not a little concerned at my not being able to keep touch with my appointment to day but multa cadunt nter calicem supremaque labra many things have fallen out between my lips and the cups of punch which i designed to drink with my friend mr sergeant to day my only associates in this place are the same that the ingenious don quixote had at the famous la manche viz the barber and the curate now the disappointment that i had from the former and the too great punctuality of the latter have been the occasion of my misfortune for the barber who should have come on saturday at three came not till sunday at eleven so that there was a necessity of dining before i went after dinner in comes the curate and invites me to take part of an ecclesiastical collation in the afternoon now gentlemen of his complexion are so hearty and so frank in their spiritual hospitality that if you do not comply with their pressing invitations you disoblige them for ever the sorrow which oppressed me for being disappointed of the conversation of a gentleman whom i esteem so much has been in some measure alleviated by the following considerations first the author whom i have at present under consideration has served me as he deserves to be used himself and has nailed my ears to his book so fast that i could not without pain unclinch my self the second alleviation is the consideration of my health for though the goddess smiles upon me here she has as great an aversion to old sodom as hugh clodpate of merry memory and might for ought i know shake hands with me at my entrance into that damned town i begin to be quite another thing than i was while i staid in the tower and there is as much difference between me on my hill here and me in my den at john richardsons as there is between a lion on a mountain in africa and one near the spurguard another comfort that i had was the extraordinary beauty of the day for it fared between me and the day without vanity be it spoken as it does between a pimp and a lady whom he has in his power if she is but tolerably handsome he gives her to his friend but if she is charmingly fair he is willing to enjoy her himself  this is the third letter which i have writ to you since i heard from you i hope the other two came to your hands i desire that you would have the goodness to send me word in what posture my affairs are i shall be unwilling to see the town till the latter end of this week unless there is a necessity for it  i am sir your etc jan    at night      to h c esquire of simplicity in poetical compositions in remarks on the  0th spectator sir by your last of the   th you desire to know my opinion of the notable critic upon chevy chase in the spectator of the   st and that of the   th of this instant that is you desire to know whether i believe the author of those two papers to be in jest or in earnest to which i answer that he is neither in jest nor in earnest not in earnest because he does not believe what he says nor in jest because he does strenuously endeavor to convince the reader of the excellence of that old dogrel his design is to see how far he can lead his reader by the nose to give my reasons for this opinion i shall send you an examen of those two spectators in as little compass as i can  when i traveled says he i took a particular delight in hearing the songs and fables that are come from father to son and are most in vogue among the common people of the countries through which i passed for it is impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approved by a multitude though they are only the rabble of a nation which has not in it some peculiar aptness to please and gratify the mind of man  now is there any thing that has the least air of a jest on the other side do you think that the author could be capable of meaning and thinking what he pretends to affirm here is it not plain by the last words which i have quoted viz the mind of man that he intended a fallacy for to affirm this of the mind of man as it is cultivated and instructed is not only absurd and ridiculous but contradictory of himself has not he himself observed in the    th tatter that there are exercises and diversions which universally please the rabble which yet men of quality or education either despise or abhor such are the shrovetuesday and beargarden diversions which he there particularizes i have known a country fiddler who has been the delight of three counties though he could never play the truth of one tune and a signpost painter who has been the admiration not only of the rabble but even of most of the squires of the north of england i appeal to the booksellers who in this case ought to be judges without appeal whether more of the common people do not approve of quarles and bunyan than esteem chevy chase therefore it is plain that author could not design that the period abovementioned should run thus  for it is impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approved of by a multitude though they are only the rabble of a nation which has not in it some peculiar aptness to please and gratify the minds of men of quality and education  and less can he design to make it run as follows for it is impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approved of by a multitude though they are only the rabble of a nation which has not in it some peculiar aptness to please and gratify the minds of the rabble for to mean this would make not only what he says but what he is a jest so that the author by the mind of man meaning neither the mind of man as it is rude and untaught nor the mind of man as it is cultivated and instructed can mean nothing in the world but to try how far he can impose upon his reader but he goes on  human nature is the same in all reasonable creatures and whatever falls in with it will meet with admirers among readers of all qualities and conditions moliere as we are told by boileau used to read all his comedies to a little old woman who was his housekeeper as she sat at her work by the chimney corner and could foretell the success of his play in his theater from the reception it met at the fire side for he tells us the audience always followed the old woman and never failed to laugh in the same place  now can you sir or any man of good sense believe that the author does not know better what belongs to a jest than to take false reasoning for one and that he does not know better what belongs to false reasoning than to mean what he says here can he be so dull and so absurd as not to know how to distinguish between what human nature is and what human nature should be human nature was human nature before the fall and it is human nature now it is degenerated from that perfect virtue and that unclouded knowledge which it enjoyed before it is the business and design of education to endeavor to retrieve in some measure the loss that human nature has sustained by the fall and to recover some measure of knowledge and virtue now heroic poetry is an imitation of human nature exalted and comedy is an imitation of human nature depraved what can be more absurd than to conclude that because the rabble that is such as never had any education are tolerable judges of human nature depraved that therefore they are judges of human nature exalted of which none can be judges but they who have had the best education and therefore not only the rabble but an universal nation has been mistaken in their judgments of poets and poetry when the judgments have been made before that nation came to be sufficiently cultivated  recte necne crocum floresque perambulet attae fabula sidubitem clament periisse pudorem cuncti pene patres ea quum reprehendere coner quae gravis aesopus quae doctus roscius egit vel quia nil rectum nisi quod placuit sibi ducunt vel quia turpe putant parere minoribus and quae imberbes didicere senes perdenda fateri hor ep   l   so that we see it was the opinion of horace that the people of quality were sometimes mistaken as well as the rabble nay that both rabble and people of quality were sometimes mistaken even in their judgments of comedy  at nostri proavi plantinos and numeros and laudavere sales nimium patienter utrumque ne dicam stulte mirati si modo ego and vos scimus inurbanum lepido seponere dicto legitimumque sonum digitis callemus and aure horat de art po and to show you that it is impossible the spectator can mean what he says here horace declares in the very verse which the spectator has chosen for the motto of his paper that the multitude is as often mistaken as it is in the right  interdum vulgus rectum videt est ubi peccat and he says particularly that they are often mistaken in their judgments of verses which have been writ by their forefathers  si veteres ita miratur laudatque poetas ut nihil anteferat nihilillis comparet errat si quaedam nimis antique si pleraque dure dicere credit eos ignave multa fatetur et sapit and mecum facit and jove judicat aequo now is not here a motto very judiciously chosen for from these verses of horace we may justly make this observation that a man by his real approbation and impertinent commendation of superannuated rhimes not only puts himself upon an equal foot with the rabble but even of the most injudicious and foolish part of the rabble  in fine horace was so far from being of opinion that the universal approbation of the multitude was the taste and touchstone of good poetry that in the last satyr of his first book he advises the poet of his formation to take no manner of care about pleasing them   neque te ut miretur turba labores contentus paucis lectoribus now this advice of horace must either be impertinent and wrong or the approbation of the multitude is a sign of an ill poem but it is time to see how this judicious author goes on  i know nothing that more shows the essential and inherent perfection of simplicity of thought above that which i call the gothic manner in writing than this that the first pleases all kinds of palates and the latter only such as have formed to themselves a wrong artificial taste upon little fanciful authors and writers of epigrams homer virgil or milton so far as the language of their poems is understood will please a reader of plain common sense that would neither relish nor comprehend an epigram of martial or a poem of cowley so on the contrary an ordinary song or ballad that is the delight of the common people cannot fail to please all such readers as are not unqualified for the entertainment by their affectation or their ignorance and the reason is plain because the same paintings of nature which recommend it to the most ordinary reader will appear beautiful to the most refined  now sir can any thing be more plain than that the spectator here cannot mean what he says because it is impossible for a man of common sense much less for one of his notable parts to be guilty of so many absurdities as there are in this little paragraph i will make no objection at present about the gothic taste i think i have called it somewhere so my self though it is certain that the pointed conceited way of wit was in fashion long before the goths were either a name or a nation for you find it not only in florus in martial in seneca in tacitus but even in some of the writers of augustus caesars age as ovid and paterculus but here are more important errors to be taken notice of for first the spectator would make us believe that all people are judges of simplicity of thought and that the rabble are better judges of it than they who have had a generous education that more people comprehend the excellency of homer and virgil and milton than the beauties of martial and cowley though perhaps there are not ten persons living who know all the merit of virgil and miltons paradise lost had been printed forty years before it was known to the greatest part of england that there barely was such a book he would further insinuate that all those songs or ballads which are the delight of the rabble cannot fail to please all such readers as are not unqualified for the entertainment by their affectation or their ignorance as if men of education in great britain were more ignorant than the rabble or it required an extraordinary stock of knowledge to comprehend the excellence of old dogrel the reason which he gives for this and which he says is plain is because the same paintings of nature which recommend it to the most ordinary reader will appear beautiful to the most refined as if some faint and imperfect touches of nature might not recommend a thing to those by reason of their ignorance or their stupidity know not how far an author ought to go in such a case to express the truth of nature which faint and imperfect strokes would by no means satisfy those who are able to judge of that truth  sir the spectator imagines here that there is nothing contrary to simplicity of thought but that pointed conceited way of writing which we mentioned above whereas simplicity of thought is thought which naturally arises from the subject ideas which bear a just proportion to the things they represent and which the subject seems of it self as it were to offer to us instead of our obtruding them upon that if we truly consider what simplicity of thought in poetry is we shall find that there are three things which are equally distant from it and those are imbecility affectation and extravagance imbecility when a man wants force to come up to the truth of nature affectation when a man goes beside it through error luxury and wantonness of soul and extravagance when a man goes beyond it through a false and lltimd effort to show his strength and excellence we shall find too that simplicity of thought is not sufficient to make what we call meter poetry that there must be likewise a simplicity of expression that a simplicity of expression is an expression which is according to nature that is an expression proportioned to the ideas as they are to the things and that consequently then the expression in great subjects and in great thoughts is simple when it is passionate figurative sounding and harmonious and that an author who in great subjects and in great thoughts shows an expression which comes short of this shows not a simplicity but an imbecility of expression in short as all the heroic virtues are compatible with simplicity of heart so all the magnificence of the most pompous eloquence is on some occasions consistent with simplicity of style but now let us see a little how the spectator goes on  the old song of chevy chase says he is the favorite ballad of the common people of england and ben johnson used to say he had rather have been the author of it than of all his works sir philip sidney in his discourse of poetry speaks of it in the following words i never heard the old song of piercy and douglas that i found not my heart more moved than with a trumpet and yet it was sung by some blind crowder with a voice as rough as his style which being so evil apparrelled in the dust aad cobweb of that uncivil age what would it work trimmed in the gorgeous eloquence of pindar for my own part says the spectator i am so professed an admirer of this antiquated song that i shall give my reader a critic upon it without any further apology for so doing  now sir as i showed you before by his sophistry that the spectator is not in earnest so here it may appear by the authorities he brings that he is not in jest i am so very well convinced of the solid judgment of ben johnson that if ben ever talked at that rate which i will not absoutely pretend to deny though i very much doubt it he only did it to laugh and to ridicule some of the sottish admirers of that obsolete song as for sir philip sidney do but observe the expression which that noble gentleman uses he tells us not that his heart was moved by the song of piercy and douglas as often as he read it or heard it read but as often as he heard  sung nay though it was sung by an old crowder i shrewdly suspect that there were some martial notes in this old gothic tune which very much contributed to the working that effect upon sir philip sidney but instead of affirming that sir philip sidney has gone too far he prends to insinuate that he falls too short for the spectator vindicates the very expresion of chevy chase in which one thing iust confess he does seem to me to come something near to a jest and to make a ne ironical ridicule upon sir philip sidney but be these things as they will besides that through the whole course of this criticism i have and shall oppose greater authorities to these i shall confound them by invincible reason before which no authority could ever stand and by showing he nature of poetry and what it is that constitutes the difference between that and prose shall make it appear that the writer of this old song in spite of the applause of so many ages never knew what poetry was in order to which let us give very near the same account of it that we formerly did in the grounds of criticism in poetry  poetry then is an art by which a poet excites passion and to that very end entertains sense by a bold and figurative language and by measured harmonious periods in order to satisfy and improve to delight and reform the mind and so to make mankind happier and better  poetry therefore is poetry because it is more passionate and sensual than prose a poet has two ways of exciting passion the one by the figurativeness and the other by the harmony of his expression but the figures contribute more to the exciting of passion than harmony a discourse that is writ in smooth and tolerable numbers if it is not figurative can be but measured prose but a discourse that is every where bold and figurative and consequently every where extremely pathetick is certainly poetry without numbers beside this alone is a convincing proof that a figurative expression is more essential  poetry than harmony viz that harmony  self if it is any thing perfect depends upon a figurative expression there being no example among the ancients themselves of a ravishing poetical music without figurative language but as the language of poetry in general is to be bold and figurative the language of great and exalted poetry is to be very bold and figurative the doctrine of horace is exactly answerable to this  primum ego me illorum dederim quibus esse poetas excerpam numero neque enim concludere versum dixeris esse satis neque siquis scribat utinos sermoni propiora putes hunc esse poetam ingenium cuisit cuimens divinior atque os magna sonaturumi des nominis hujus honorem idcirco quidam comaedia necne poema esset quaesivere quodacer spiritus ac vis nec verbis nec rebus inest nisi quod pede certo differt sermoni sermo merus for he tells us here three things in a very conspicuous manner first that poetical measures are not sufficient to constitute a man a poet   neque enim concludere versum dixeris esse satis secondly that there must be great passion and a bold and a figurative language nay very bold and very figurative  ingenium cui sit cui mens divinior atque os magna sonaturum des nominis bujus honorem and thirdly that it was to be questioned whether any thing but the great and exalted poetry was properly poetry  idcirco quidam comaedia necne poema esset quaesivere quod acer spiritus ac vis nec verbis nec rebus inest boileau is exactly of the same opinion and has in his ninth satyr as it were interpreted part of this passage of horace  mais repondez un peu quelle verve indiscrete sans laveu des neuf soeurs vous a rendu poet senties vous dites moy ces violence transports qui d un esprit divin font mouvoir les ressorts and in his eighth reflection upon longinus he tells us plainly that monsieur perrault having translated the beginning of the first ode of pindar without figures has translated it without poetry  rapin is exactly of the same mind in his twenty ninth reflection upon poetry in general for having told us that virgil in he fourth of his georgicks speaks of the bees every where in the metaphorical terms of court legions armies combats fields of battle kings captains soldiers that by this figurative and lofty manner he may exalt the lowness of his mater he adds  cest ainsi quun grand ouvrier comme virgile ne dit presque rien dans le propre and cest en quoy consiste le grand art de la poesy de dire figurement presque tout ce uelle dit car d ordinaire les figures urnissent des plus grands images que les hoses memes enfin le poet doit scavoir  toutes chooses ce que l eloquence a d art and de method pour les figures ce nest ue par les figures quil done de la force ux passions de l eclat aux discourse du ids aux raisons and de l agreement a tout  quil dit et ce nest que par les figures  plus vives de l eloquence que tous les ovemens de l ame deviennent ardens and assionnez which is in english thus  thus a great master like virgil scarce ys any thing in plain language and the reat art of poetry consists in saying almost every thing that is said figuratively for the figures generally supply us with images greater than the things themselves in short a poet ought to be possessed of all that art and that method in which eloquence is designed to instruct us with regard to the figures they are the figures that enable him to give force to the passions brightness to the diction and to the periods weight to his arguments and charms to all that he says and it is only by the liveliest figures of eloquence that all the motions of the soul become ardent and pathetick  as for simplicity of which the spectator boasts so much the foresaid rapin has remarkably told us in his twenty seventh reflection that the simplicity of thought and even simplicity of expression in great subjects is not incompatible with the greatest pomp and magnificence for simplicity of thought and simplicity of expression is nothing but such thought and such expression as nature in such and such cases voluntarily suggests and dictates to us  la troisieme qualite de la diction says rapin est quelle soit naturelle sans affectations selon les regles de la biensance and du bon sens les phrases trop etudiees un style trop fleury les manieres trop compassees les beaux mots les terms trop recherchees and toutes les expressions extraordinaries sont insupportable a la veritable poesy la seule simplicite luy convient pourv quelle sait soutenue de noblesse and le grandeur maiscette simplicite nest conue que des grandes ames cest le chef l oeuvre de la poesy and le caractere de homere and de virgile les ignorans y cherchent de l esprit and des beaux sentimens parce quils sont ignorans la diction doit etre relevee and eclatante cest sa quatrieme qualite car tout ce qui est comun and ordinaire dans les terms ne luy  pas propre il faut des paroles qui ayent rien de bas and de vulgaire une diction noble and magnifique des expressions arts des couleurs vives des traits har dis fin il faut un discourse qui puisse egar la grandeur des idees dun ouvrier qui it etre le createur de son ouvrage la nquieme qualite de la diction est detre mbreuse pour soutenir cet air grand and majesteux dont se sert la poesy and pour primer toute la force toute la dignite es grandes chooses qu elle dit il ne luy ut que des terms propres a remplir la ouche and a contenter les oreilles pour enir a ce merveilleux quelle recherche en utes chooses mais ce nest pas assez quil  a de la grandeur and de la magnificence ans l expression il doit y avoir aussi de  chaleur and de la vehemence and il faut r tout quil regne dans les discourse un rtain air de grace and de delicatesse qui  fasse le principal ornement and la beauty la plus universelle which most remarkable passage is rendered thus  the third quality of the diction is that it ought to be natural without any manner of affectation according to the rules of decorum and of good sense phrases that appear too much studied a style that is too florid a manner that is too nicely wrought things that are finely said terms that are too far fetched and all expressions that are windy and swell use are insupportable to the true poetry only simplicity can agree with it provided that simplicity be sustained by nobility and by greatness but that is a simplicity with which only great souls are acquainted it is the masterwork of poetry and the character of homer and virgil the ignorant look for what they call wit and fine thoughts because they are ignorant the fourth quality of the diction is that it be exalted and sonorous for every thing that is vulgar in the expression is below it it requires words which have nothing that is base and common in them a diction that is noble and magnificent expressions that are strong and colors that are lively and daring and audacious strokes it requires to say all a discourse that is able to come up to the greatness of that workmans ideas who ought to be the maker and creator of his own works the fifth quality of the diction is that it be harmonious that it may maintain that great and majestic air with which poetry is wont to adorn it self and may express all the force and the utmost dignity of the great things which it utters it ought to reject all terms but those that are proper to fill the mouth and content the ear that it may attain to that sublime and that wonderful which it always and every where aims at but it is not sufficient that there be greatness and magnificence in the expression there ought to be likewise ardor and vehemence and there ought especially to reign throughout the discourse a fine a graceful and a delicate air which ought to appear its principal ornament and its most universal beauty  now what one of these great qualities has the old ballad of chevy chase of all the lines which the captain has quoted it is remarkable that there is but one which has any thing like a figure in it now though the subject of that song is noble yet there being nothing figurative in it it is plain by consequence that there is nothing great nothing noble in it no magnificence no vehemence no painting no poetry to compare any of the passages in it to virgil is ridiculous and a man may as well compare a dead man to a living for example what manner of comparison is there between these two passages  the hounds ran swiftly through the wood the nimble deer to take and with their cries the hills and dales an echo shrill did make and that of virgil   vocat ingenti clamore cithaeron taygetique canes domitrixque epidaurus equorum et vox assensu nemorum ingeminata remugit what is there in the first but what is vile and trivial what ploughman what tinker what trull is not capable of saying the like but that of virgil where he gives voice to the mountains and voice consent and soul to the words is so bold so figurative so pompous so harmonious that a man must be virgil himself to say it what can be more ridiculous nay more monstrous than to find any thing resembling in the following abominable dogrel  sir charles martell of ratcliffe too his sisters son was he sir david lamb so well esteemed yet saved could not be and the following verses of virgil   cadit and ripheus justissimus unus qui fuit in teucris and servantissimus aequi diis aliter visum where the divine harmony is the result of uncommon passion and productive of no vulgar passion thus we see that in spite of the pretended resemblance the old dogrel is contemptible and virgil is incomparable and inimitable one might with a great deal more justice pretend that there is a resemblance between the    th psalm of sternhold and that admirable hymn of milton in the fifth book of paradise lost and yet we need only transcribe them both and place them together here to convince the reader that the one is bald and vile and wretched and the other great and exalted poetry let us begin with the psalm of sternhold  give laud unto the lord from heaven that is so high praise him in deed and word above the starry sky and also ye his angels all armies royal praise joyfully praise him both sun and moon which are so clear and bright the same of you be done ye glittering stars of night and ye no less ye heavens fair and clouds of the air his laud express for at his word they were all formed as we see at his voice did appear all things in their degree which he set fast to them he made a law and trade always to last extol and praise gods name on earth ye dragons fell all deeps do ye the same for it becomes ye well him magnify fire hail ice snow and storms that blow at his decree the hills and mountains all and trees that fruitful are the cedars great and tall his worthy praise declare beasts and cattle yea birds flying and worms creepiug that on earth dwell thus have we laid before the reader the contemptible dogrel of hopkins a version which is despicable dogrel in spite of its being figurative for every line here is a different apostrophe but these are figures which are another persons which the transverser repeats like a parrot without understanding them and without being moved by them and which consequently have neither passion nor sublimity to sustain them for it is a just observation which is made by longinus that as the figures support the pathetick and the sublime they are wonderfully supported by each of them let us now see how the force of miltons genius hides and conceals the assistance of art while these lofty figures at the very time that they raise and transport his exalted soul are lost in his enthusiasm and his sublimity as the glittering of numberless stars is swallowed and lost in the blaze of day and that golden deluge of light which on every side overwhelms them the following hymn is spoken by our first parents in the morning at what time they first come out of the bower in paradise and survey the works of god which the springing day has restored to them  these are thy glorious works parent of good almighty thine this universal frame thus wondrous fair thy self how wondrous then unspeakable who sitst above these heavens to us invisible or dimly seen in these thy lowest works yet these declare thy goodness beyond thought and power divine speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light angels for ye behold him and with songs and choral symphonies day without night circle his throne rejoicing ye in heaven on earth join all ye creatures to extol him first him last him midst and without end fairest of stars last in the train of night if better thou belong not to the dawn sure pledge of day that crownst the smiling morn with thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere while day arises that sweet hour of prime thou sun of this great world both eye and soul acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise in thy eternal course both when thou climbest and when high noon have gained and when thou fallst moon that now meetst the orient sun now fleest with the fixed stars fixed in their orb that flies and ye five other wandering fires that move in mystic dance not without song resound his praise who out of darkness called up light air and ye elements the eldest birth of natures womb that in quaternion run perpetual circle multiform and mix and nourish all things let your ceaseless change vary to our great maker still new praise ye mists and exhalatious that now rise from hill or steaming lake duskie or gray till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold in honor to the worlds great author rise whether to deck with clouds the uncolourd sky or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers rising and falling still advance his praise his praise ye winds that from four quarters blow breath soft or loud and wave your tops ye pines with every plant in sign of worship wave fountains and ye that warble as ye flow melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise joy voices all ye living souls ye birds that singing up to heavens gates ascend bear on your wings and in your notes his praise ye that in waters glide and ye that walk the earth and stately tread or lowly creep witness if i be silent morn or even to hill or valley fountain or fresh shades made vocal by my song and taught his praise hail universal lord be bounteous still to give us only good and if the night has gathered ought of evil or concealed disperse it as now light dispels the dark now i think nothing can be more plain than that notwithstanding the same psalm of david is the groundwork both of milton and sternhold and notwithstanding a vain appearance which may delude those who are not able to distinguish there is no more resemblance between the hymn of milton and the version of sternhold than there is between light and darkness heat and cold life and death heaven and earth the graces and deformity no notwithstanding they both make use of the very same figures but those figures in sternhold are dead and he himself seems dead and while he pretends to give life and soul and thought and spirit and motion even to the insensible and inanimated parts of the universe he is himself without spirit or life or soul or thought or motion while miltons matchless genius animating the several figures appears to give life and soul and motion to their several objects and seems to equal these several mighty objects in their distinguishing qualities to be lofty as the heaven and solid as the earth firey as the sun and changing as the moon swift as the winds and strong and terrible and sonorous as the arms and mouths of the great deep since then there is no manner of resemblance between the hymn and the version which seem to have several things in common what shadow of likeness can there be between virgil and english dogrel where there is nothing common between them nor groundwork nor figure nor harmony the dogrel being utterly destitute both of figure and harmony and consequently void of the great qualities which distinguish poetry from prose  i am your etc  to the master of the revels writ upon the first acting of a play called the successful pyrate sir i have so much concern for your reputation that i think it my duty to acquaint you that you have been very severely censured for licensing the last play never say they was the stage prostituted to so vile a degree before it has more than once been accused of promoting vice but was never taxed till now with encouraging villainy and is the man say they who is set over it to restrain it from encouraging vice is he become instrumental in its promoting villainy and such villainy such a complication of contemptible folly and of dreadful abominable wickedness as was never beheld upon any stage before good god say they was any thing wanting to the extravagance of this degenerate age but the making a tarpawlin and a swabber and a living tarpawlin and a swabber the hero of a tragedy who at the same time that he is strutting in buskins here is lolling at madagascar with some drunken sunburned whore over a can of flip the greatest rogue and the most detestable villain that ever the sun or moon beheld banished not only from his own but from all countries declared the pest of all human society and pursued to death as a devoted creature odious and noxious to mankind the stage of whose tragedy if he is caught in england will undoubtedly be at wapping men of common sense are in amazement and fting up their hands and their eyes exaim what could this judicious author ean by introducing upon the stage a hero of executiondock unless that a character might be shown which should be ought adequate to the player and that e hero of a tragedy might at length  produced which might be acted to the ery life and this rogue is christened rsooth the successful pyrate but sure y they this pious christian had most pa godfathers for is not this name say ey a name of notable instruction and of e morality does it not speak plainly to  following purpose men brethren  children if any of you have a mind to push on your fortunes or supply your luxuries by such vigorous methods as fools call wicked and violent begin to be rogues and prosper we will encourage you to go on and to dispel the idle and vain fears of providence and divine vengeance by showing a greater rogue than any of you can pretend to be and showing him prosperous and successful and we here declare upon our honors that if any of you gentlemen of the galleries have a mind to turn robbers upon the high seas to plunder our ships and to fill our jayls with our merchants and our hospitals with their wives and children we here declare that if he succeeds rather than that fortunate rogue should not be celebrated we will not only act him but write him our selves according to the best of  damnable talents this say the persons mentioned above is the blessed moral of this play which must needs  wonderfully agreeable to a civilized  a trading people as i said at first  thought it my duty to acquaint y with this  i am sir your etc  to tho sergeant esquire sent with a cicero which i had borrowed of him in a very small print sir i here send you back your cicero as i would return a friends mistress to him who had entrusted me with her untouched though much desired and though very willing that i have an extreme passion for cicero is but truth but if i should say of him as a spark did of a fair lady that i love him more than my eyes which made me love him that would be hyperbolical being willing then to preserve my eyes for all my friends for my mortal friends in cloth and drugget and silk and crape and linsey woolsey and for my immortal friends in leather and for cicero among the rest though last not least beloved i here return him to you and desire you to deliver sir john marsham into the hands of the bearer that is indeed as the fable has it to lay the body of dead sphinx upon an ass but the knight was a sort of an antiquary and an ass you know was a beast respected by antiquity  i am sir your etc tower feb  0      to mr    sir i am not able to give you the directions you desire to find mr b r nor have i seen him lately nor will i ever see him more if i can help it i hate a traitor who is always bragging of his honor and honesty the men of honor and honesty never bragg they let their actions speak for them i never in all my lifetime knew a man who often bragged of his honor or a woman who often boasted of her chastity but the one was a true bred whore and the other a rascal vile enough to bring a pillory into fresh disgrace when a man boasts of his own moral virtues is a sign for the most part that he is conscious of the contrary vices and so has recourse to bragging to blind the eyes of those with whom he converses but the very trick by which he cheats fools discovers him to men of common sense and so his brains are like the foxes heels by which the beast escapes from mungrils but is betrayed to the hounds the greatest coward boasts most of his courage the eternal talkative noisie fool of his sense even talking perpetually is implicit bragging for why should a man talk always more than his company if he did not believe that nature had given him a call for it and made him a perpetual dictator one hypocrite makes more noise and more show of his zeal than twenty real saints there are bullies in honor and in religion as well as there are in courage b r is a bully in all three the man who wants gratitude can have no one virtue whatever  i am your etc whitehall oct        to mr bradley sir since among the rest of the obligations which i have to you you have been so generous as to defend me from that accusation of ill nature which has been brought against me by some who are so far from knowing me that perhaps they never saw me i am animated by so friendly a proceeding to send you my thoughts upon this subject as they have from time to time come into my mind as well as i am able to recollect them in that ill state of health under which i labor at present  as this accusation is brought against me by those who are utter strangers to me it must proceed from the books which i have published and particularly from the books of criticism but if in my criticism i am in the right my very being so must be a sufficient apology against that accusation for he who accuses a man of ill nature for writing a just criticism knows not what is meant by either of the terms either by ill nature or criticism by ill nature must be meant something that is contrary to the true nature of man as by goodnature must be understood something that is agreeable to it or the one can be no term of reproach nor the other of commendation but the true nature of man must consist in reason which distinguishes him from all other creatures and therefore no discourse or action that is reasonable can possibly denominate him illnatured  but as the true nature of man is reasonable it is likewise social and man is therefore the most social of creatures because he is the most reasonable now a just criticism is perfectly agreeable to the nature of man considered as it is social for what does the good critic design he designs to detect and disgrace error to disclose and honor truth he designs the advancement of a noble art and by it the interest and glory of his native country which depend in no small measure upon the flourishing of arts  if he has the greatest goodness of nature who has the largest share of social virtue if he has the largest share of social virtue who labors most for the happiness of the society in which he lives and of all his fellow creatures in general if the happiness of ones native country and of humankind in general depend more under god upon the maintenance of liberty than upon any other thing whatsoever who can justly pretend not only of the writers of the present age but of the english writers in general to a greater goodness of nature than my self who have made it the constant business of my life to defend and maintain liberty who has taken more delight in praising her benefactor or in branding and defaming her avowed and mortal enemies in short sir liberty has been the continual theme of my pen and the constant employment of my life and have i taken all this pains for my self no i wanted not common sense to discern that the british liberties would be of longer continuance than my life but the growing corruptions of my countrymen gave me too just grounds to apprehend that liberty in great britain would not last many centuries i therefore resolved to cast in my mite toward the rendering it perpetual in this island and yet i knew very well and foresaw that by this very endeavor to serve them i should draw upon me the hatred of a great part of my countrymen and by consequence a thousand different slanders they have given me distempers of body and defects of mind of which i have not the least knowledge and the opinion of my illnature has proceeded as much from my endeavors to maintain and prolong liberty and by consequence to perpetuate happiness to them and to their posterity as from my detecting and exposing successful poetasters for which if i am sorry for my self i am more sorry for my country for a people so disposed can be free no longer than their rulers are willing they should be so i am in so faint and languishing a condition that i can proceed no further though i have many things to say but i will certainly resume this subject if i ever retrieve my vigor  i am etc march  0    0   to the right honorable the lord treasurer godolphin my lord i here send your lordship a dramatick poem called liberty asserted which i wrote before i had the honor to be known to your lordship and send upon occasion of its being the first british play that is acted that is the first after the accomplishment of this happy union which has been so nobly brought about by your lordships wisdom and which has asserted and ensured the liberties of great britain my lord that this plays being accidentally revived at this extraornary juncture may prove of happy presage to the prosperity of great britain and to your lordships fame which must flourish eternally with this islands prosperity is and shall be the zealous and perpetual wish of  my lord your lordships etc  to his grace the duke of buckingham written in the name and at the request of one who designed to send him the lives of some of our celebrated english poets my lord the whole body of english narrative poets have here the honor to wait on your grace and to desire your patronage of whom the most celebrated among such of them as were your contemporaries have so often attended upon you separately to implore your protection my lord those among them who are living look upon themselves as probationers for fame and cannot be assured of that glory to which they aspire till your grace has given judgment concerning them few of those who are dead have been dead long enough for the world to be assur of their real merit and whether it will be great and lasting enough to pass to our latest posterity the opinions of the public in things of this nature are variable and uncertain and the reputations of authors are subject to strange reverses never any poet left a greater reputation behind him than mr cowley while milton remained obscure and known but to few but your grace knows very well that the great reputation of cowley did not continue half a century and that miltons is now upon the pinnacle of the temple of fame it is hardly possible that so many ages should have remained in the dark with regard to almost every thing that relates to homer if his poems had during his life time been received with that vast that universal applause which they met with after his death fannius an impertinent roman scribbler yet found so much success in his own time and so general an approbation that both his works and his picture were set up in the library which augustus had consecrated in the temple of apollo palatine while horace complains that he was neither read nor known and yet your grace knows very well that this happened at a time when the roman poetry and the roman taste were in their height of excellence but length of days distinguished justly between them and satisfied the world of the nice judgment and the fine discernment of mecaenas and augustus caesar length of days my lord consigned horace to eternal fame and fannius to eternal infamy  the whole body then of english narrative poets considering this uncertainty and this inconstancy of the people proceeding from their ignorance and their want of taste here bring their causes before your grace to be tried by you in the last appeal and depend no further on the fallible decrees of the people than as they shall be affirmed by your graces judgment from which they expect an assurance of fame and an earnest of immortality  my lord it has been the common custom of authors on these occasions to publish a panegyric on their patrons excellencies a custom from which at present i am obliged to deviate because nothing is less entertaining than stale news let the subject matter of it be never so great and glorious if i should relate with how much bravery in your early youth you affronted death in the cause of your country when at the same time you were possessed of every thing that makes mortals fond of life when at the same time you were crowned with honors laden with riches and courted by pleasure if i should tell the world how much you were distinguished by your gallantry and your politeness in the most polite and most gallant court that ever this island saw that you have been always as penetrating and profound in the cabinet as you have been active and brave in the field that in your administration of the great offices of the crown you have shown your self equal to the greatest and the sublimest employments and that you have been always one of the most shining ornaments of the most august assembly in he world the reader would cry that this  reprinting an old gazette and pretending to inform people of actions and qualities that have been many a year in the mouths of all the world and which have been long since much better described by he pens of those very gentlemen of whose actions and writings this volume is composed as i should be confounded with so ust a reproach i shall confine my self with returning thanks to your grace for the protection which you vouchsafe to grant  this account of the lives and writings of so many men of merit in conjunction and for that protection and encouragement by which you have several times distinguished several of them i shall content my self with wishing that your grace may ong continue to be the shining ornament of your country and the protector of every generous art that you may live to see the noble marquess of normanby inherit his fathers great qualities and copy his bright example to see him rival in sense in spirit and in judgment the immortal offspring of your mind to see him rival your own brutus in defending the rights of his country and asserting the liberties of mankind but defending the one and asserting the other with that glorious success and that transcendent happiness which ought always to attend the champions of public liberty  i am my lord your graces etc  to walter moyle esquire dear sir i was so very much tired the last post with sending away several letters that i was incapable of writing any thing that could have been agreeable to you though it had been never so short i am sorry to hear of the complaints you make of the effects of the spleen i desire you to pardon my plaindealing which proceeds purely from that esteem and affection which i have always had for you ever since i had the honor to know you before i venture to tell you that a person of your fortune and understanding need not have the spleen any longer than he pleases the spleen is nothing but the effect of stagnation and the motion of vigorous exercise must and will cure it take a gentle trotting horse and an honest careful servant and come up and see your old friends and this wicked town but for one fortnight and if the journey to this town and back again into cornwall and the strange sights which you will see here do not remove the spleen for one six months i will be contented to have it for twelve for you who have now been absent twenty years will find here a town entirely new new buildings new men new manners avarice and luxury and profusion joined in a triple league and liberty property and religion engaged in a battle royal you will find here entirely new setts of all sorts of men new players at chess who never could yet see two removes before them new whigs without one dram of public spirit and new wits and poets without one grain of common sense you will find a new idol worshipped in the midst of a christian country a base dirty contemptible idol worshipped by all that once was thought great and noble and estimable you will find his temple in the midst of that countrys metropolis a temple as dirty and despicable as its deity a temple without either roof or door or desk or pew or altar yet its pragmatical priests as proud as they are base and sordid his priests composed of insolent cits and pers and pres his humble worshippers who humbly worship nay abjectly adore both the idol and his priests you will see his worshippers arrive in crowds from morning to the evening and mingled in his temple in as monstrous a manner as the elements were in chaos where fire with water earth with air were blended and confounded as all these sights will be new i believe they will be very diverting and what will be as new and as diverting as all the rest you will see in this town old friends with new shapes and faces for example you will find your old friend mr w dwindled to those narrow dimensions in which you formerly beheld me and your humble servant enlarged to his quondam noble bulk and proportions  i am etc london may       0 to the honorable major pack containing some remarkable passages of mr wycherleys life sir i have lately had the satisfaction to read over your memoirs of mr wycherley which i had last week from mr c and found the relation very entertaining and the reflections just and pathetick if i give you hints of some particular passages which seem either to have slipped from your memory or to have escaped your knowledge i flatter my self that you will receive them kindly since they are only sent with intention to give you an opportunity whenever you have a mind to retouch your memoirs to make them more complete though they cannot be more agreeable  and now sir to enter upon the subject without any more ceremony i never could learn either from mr wycherley himself or from mr dryden or sir harry sheer or mr walkeden or from any of those who had been longest acquainted with mr wycherley that he had ever resided at either of our universities about the age of fifteen he was sent for education to the western parts of france either to saintonge or the angoumois his abode there was either upon the banks of the charante or very little removed from it and he had there the happiness to be in the neighborhood of one of the most accomplished ladies of the court of france madame de montausier whom voiture has made famous by several very ingenious letters the most of which were writ to her when she was a maid and called mademoiselle de rambouillet i have heard mr w say that he was often admitted to the conversation of that lady who used to call him the little hugenot and that young as he was he was equally pleased with the beauty of her mind and with the graces of her person  upon the writing his first play which was st jamess park he became acquainted with several of the most celebrated wits both of the court and town the writing of that play was likewise the occasion of his becoming acquainted with one of king charless mistesses after a very particular manner as mr wycherley was going through pall mall toward st jamess in his chariot he met the foresaid lady in hers who thrusting half her body out of the chariot cried out aloud to him you wycherley you are a son of a whore at the same time laughing aloud and heartily perhaps sir if you never heard of this passage before you may be surprised at so strange a greeting from one of the most beautiful and best bred ladies in the world mr wycherley was certainly very much surprised at it yet not so much but he soon apprehended it was spoke with allusion to the latter end of a song in the forementioned play  when parents are slaves their brats cannot be any other great wits and great braves have always a punk to their mother as during mr wycherleys surprise the chariots drove different ways they were soon at a considerable distance from each other when mr wycherley recovering from his surprise ordered his coachman to drive back and to overtake the lady as soon as he got over against her he said to her madam you have been pleased to bestow a title on me which generally belongs to the fortunate will your ladyship be at the play to night well she replied what if i am there why then i will be there to wait on your ladyship though i disappoint a very fine woman who has made me an assignation so said she you are sure to disappoint a woman who has favored you for one who has not yes he replied if she who has not favored me is the finer woman of the two but he who will be constant to your ladyship till he can find a finer woman is sure to die your captive the lady blushed and bade her coachman drive away as she was then in all her bloom and the most celebrated beauty that was then in england or perhaps that has been in england since she was touched with the gallantry of that compliment in short she was that night in the first row of the kings box in drury lane and mr wycherley in the pit under her where he entertained her during the whole play and this sir was the beginning of a correspondence between these two persons which afterward made a great noise in the town  but now sir i shall proceed to remind you of something more extraordinary and that is that the correspondence between mr wycherley and the foresaid lady was the occasion of bringing mr wycherley into favor with george duke of buckingham who was passionately in love with that lady who was ill treated by her and who believed mr wycherley his happy rival after the duke had long solicited her without obtaining any thing whether the relation between them shocked her for she was his cousingermain or whether she apprehended that an intrigue with a person of his rank and character a person upon whom the eyes of all men were fixed must of necessity in a little time come to the kings ears whatever was the cause she refused to admit of his visits so long that at last indignation rage and disdain took place of his love and he resolved to ruin her when he had taken this resolution he had her so narrowly watched by his spies that he soon came to the knowledge of those whom he had reason to believe his rivals and after he knew them he never failed to name them aloud in order to expose the lady to all those who frequented him and among others he used to name mr wycherley as soon as it came to the knowledge of the latter who had all his expectations from the court he apprehended the consequence of such a report if it should reach the king he applied himself therefore to wilmot lord rochester and to sir charles sedley and entreated them to remonstrate to the duke of buckingham the mischief which he was about to do to one who had not the honor to be known to him and who had never offended him upon their opening the matter to the duke he cried out immediately that he did not blame wycherley he only accused his cousin ay but they replied by rendering him suspected of such an intrigue you are about to ruin him that is your grace is about to ruin a man with whose conversation you would be pleased above all things upon this occasion they said so much of the shining qualities of mr wycherley and of the charms of his conversation that the duke who was as much in love with wit as he was with his kinswoman was impatient till he was brought to sup with him which was in two or three nights after supper mr wycherley who was then in the height of his vigor both of body and mind thought himself obliged to exert himself and the duke was charmed to that degree that he cried out in a transport by g my cousin is in the right of it and from that very moment made a friend of a man whom he believed his happy rival  the duke of buckingham gave him solid sensible proofs of his esteem and affection for as he was at the same time master of the horse to king charles and colonel of a regiment as master of the horse he made him one of his equeries and as colonel of a regiment he made him captain lieutenant of his own company resigning to him at the same time his own pay as captain and all other advantages that could be justly made of the company i remember that about that time i who was come up from the university to see my friends in town happened to be one night at the fountain tavern in the strand with the late dr duke david loggen the painter and mr wilson of whom otway has made honorable mention in tonsons first miscellany and that after supper we drank mr wycherleys health by the name of captain wycherley  he was not long after this in such high favor with the king that that monarch gave him a proof of his esteem and affection which never any sovereign prince before had given to an author who was only a private gentleman mr wycherley happened to fall sick of a fever at his lodgings in bowstreet covent garden during which sickness the king did him the honor to visit him when finding his fever indeed abated but his body extremely weakened and his spirits miserably shattered he commanded him as soon as he was able to take a journey to go to the south of france believing that nothing would contribute more to the restoring his former vigor than the gentle salutiferous air of montpelier during the winter season at the same time the king was pleased to assure him that as soon as he was capable of taking that journey he would order five hundred pounds to be paid him to defray the expense of it  mr wycherley accordingly went into france in the beginning of the winter of      if i am not mistaken and returned into england in the latter end of the spring of      entirely restored to his former vigor both of body and mind the king received him with the utmost marks of favor and shortly after his arrival told him that he had a son who he was resolved should be educated like the son of a king and that he could make choice of no man so proper to be his governor as mr wycherley that for that service he should have fifteen hundred pounds a year paid him for the payment of which he should have an assignment upon three several offices whose names i have forgot to which the king added that when the time came that his office was to cease he would take care to make such a provision for him as should set him above the malice of the world and fortune  and now sir is it not matter of wonder that one of mr wycherleys extraordinary merit who was esteemed by all the most deserving persons of the court of king charles the second and in high favor with the king himself should in a little time after he had received these gracious offers which seem to have made and to have fixed his fortune be thrown into prison for bare seven hundred pounds and be suffered to languish there during the last four years of that monarchs reign forsaken by all his friends at court and quite abandoned by the king it is no easy matter sir to find a more extraordinary instance of the vicissitude of human affairs and if the cause of so strange an alteration is unknown to you i dare promise my self that you are very desirous to hear it  it was immediately after mr wycherley had received these gracious offers from the king that the waterdrinking season coming on he went down to tunbridge to take either the benefit of the waters or the diversions of the place when walking one day upon the wells walk with his friend mr fairbeard of greysinn just as he came up to the booksellers my lady drogheda a young widow rich noble and beautiful came to the bookseller and inquired for the plain dealer madam says mr fairbeard since you are for the plain dealer there he is for you pushing mr wycherley toward her yes says mr wycherley this lady can bear plain dealing for she appears to be so accomplished that what would be compliment said to others spoke to her would be plain dealing no truly sir said the lady i am not without my faults any more than the rest of my sex and yet notwithstanding all my faults i love plain dealing and never am more fond of it than when it tells me of my faults then madam said mr fairbeard you and the plain dealer seem designed by heaven for each other in short mr wycherley walked with her upon the walks waited upon her home visited her daily at her lodgings while she staid at tunbridge and after she went to london at her lodgings in hatton garden where in a little time he got her consent to marry her which he did by his fathers command without acquainting the king for it was reasonably supposed that the lady having a great independent estate and noble and powerful relations the acquainting the king with the intended marriage might be the likeliest way to prevent it as soon as the news of it came to court it was looked upon as an affront to the king and a contempt of his majestys offers and mr wycherleys conduct after his marriage made this be resented more heinously for seldom or never coming near the court he was thought downright ungrateful but the true cause of his absence was not known and the court was at that time too much alarmed and in too much disquiet to enquire into it in short sir the lady was jealous of him to distraction jealous to that degree that she could not endure that he should be one moment out of her sight their lodgings were in bowstreet covent garden over against the cock whither if he at any time went with his friends he was obliged to leave the windows open that the lady might see there was no woman in company or she would be immediately in a downright raving condition whether this outrageous jealousy proceeded from the excess of her passion for she loved her husband with the same violence with which she had done her lover or from the great things which she had heard reported of his manly prowess which were not answered by her experience or from them both together mr wycherley thought that he was obliged to humor it and that he could not be too indulgent to a lady who had bestowed both her person and her fortune on him this sir was the cause that brought mr wycherley all at once into the utmost disgrace with the court whose favor and affection but just before he possessed in the highest degree and these sir are the particulars of mr wycherleys life which seem either to have slipped from your memory or to have escaped your knowledge  i am etc sept      0
