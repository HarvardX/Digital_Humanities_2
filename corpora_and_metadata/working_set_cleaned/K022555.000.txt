new hay at the old market an occasional drama in one act written by george colman the younger on opening the haymarket theater on the  th of june       london printed by w woodfall for t cadell and w davies strand      price one shilling  advertisement it may be necessary to inform the reader who has not seen the following sketch represented on the stage that the character of apewell is meant merely as a vehicle for mr caulfields imitations with which both the mimick and the author of the piece are convinced the respectable persons imitated have too much good sense to be offended they are given as portraits not as caricatures and the public has pronounced them to be strong but unexaggerated likenesses of originals whom its discernment has long patronised and admired  although the author has been a litte free with his good friends the winter managers who are a little free with his season he thinks it needless to offer any apology to them he is upon too good a footing with them to suppose that they expect it friends and neighbors may joke with each other tap for tap and so part fair  dramatis personae men fustian mr suett daggerwood mr bannister jun apewell mr caulfield

persons of distinction you would make an excellent macbeth sir   fustian sir   daggerwood macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep balm of hurt minds great natures second course  faith and very often the first course too when a dinner is unavoidably deferred by your humble servant to command sylvester daggerwood   fustian i am sorry sir you should ever have occasion to postpone so pleasant a

one wife three shirts and nine children   fustian a very numerous family   daggerwood a crowded house to be sure sir but not profitable mrs daggerwood a fine figure but unfortunately stutters so of no use in the theatrieal line children too young to make a debut  except my eldest master apollo daggerwood a youth of only eight years old who has twice made his appearance in tom thumb to an overflowing and brilliant barn  house i mean  with unbounded and universal applause   fustian have you been long upon the stage mr daggerwood   daggerwood fifteen years since i first smelt the lamp sir my father was an eminent buttonmaker at birmingham and meant to marry me to miss molly meter daughter to the rich director of the coalworks at wolverhampton but i had a soul above buttons and abhorred the idea of a mercenary marriage i panted for a liberal profession  so ran away from my father and engaged with a traveling company of comedians in my travels i had soon the happiness of forming a romantic attachment with the present mrs daggerwood  wife to sylvester daggerwood your humble servant to command whose benefit is fixed for the eleventh of june by the particular desire of several persons of distinction so you see sir i have a taste   fustian have you then sit down and i will read you my tragedy i am determined somebody shall hear it before i go out of the house sits

i should think so  and to all appearance one of the norwood party   daggerwood now sir your title and then for the dram pers   fustian the title i think will strike the fashion of plays you know now is to do away old prejudices and to rescue certain characters from the illiberal odium with which custom has marked them thus we have a generous israelite an amiable cynick and so on now sir i call my play  the humane footpad   daggerwood what   fustian there is a title for you is not it happy  eh how do you like my footpad   daggerwood humph  why i think he will strike  but then he ought to be properly executed   fustian oh sir let me alone for that an exception to a general rule is now the grand secret for dramatick composition mine is a freebooter of benevolence and plunders with sentiment   daggerwood there may be something in that and for my part i was always with shakespeare who steals my purse steals trash i never had any weighty reasons yet for thinking otherwise now sir

the honestest master carpenter when an individual has combined private worth with public talent he quits the bustling scene of life with twofold applause and we doubly deplore his exit  but come we

etc  prompter upon my word that was very well respectably delivered and much in the manner of the original   apewell oh sir if it was like the original it could not fail of being respectable  but if you think from the specimen i may be of service mrs apewell and myself will be willing to join you   prompter does mrs apewell perform principal characters sir   apewell why i cannot say much for her acting but she is a devilish good wife  go thy ways kate the man in the world who shall report he has a better wife let him in naught be trusted for speaking false in that thou art alone if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness thy meekness saintlike wifelike government obeying in commanding and thy parts sovereign and pious else could speak thee out the queen of earthly queens she is noble born and like her true nobility she has carried herself toward me  prompter you have shakespeare at your fingers ends mr apewell   apewell why yes  but i am talking here by words of mouth when i could say

exit prompter faith a young fellow of talent enter bannister jun ah bannister  bannister waldron how goes it well here we are in the old little shop again gad i feel like a giant here in lilliput after the huge brobdignag boards of old drury where is our little manager   prompter not come yet   bannister he must stir his stumps i can tell him that now he has set up for himself he gives a good round sum for the property they tell me i hope he may be reimbursed   prompter there he trusts to the town   bannister he cannot trust to any thing better the public never fail to encourage industry or to give ample reward to those who embark with zeal in their service and rely with confidence on their liberality i shall be finely worked for it though through the summer i take it master waldron   prompter well then as you say the public will encourage your industry   bannister oh faith you need not tell me that  i trust i have always been found to work willingly  and at present i have a double motive to activity in serving the town and assisting an old friend who ventures largely for its amusement so here is defiance to heat and a fig for the dog days old waldron   enter callboy callboy the ladies and gentlemen are all ready in the greenroom sir   prompter then well attend them oh bannister here is a song i am to give you it is intended for our opening   bannister let me see it um  why zouns there must be some mistake it seems meant for the winter  for it begins with an eulogy upon grand spectacles spacious buildings and large theaters   prompter well well  hum it over before we go into the greenroom   bannister eh  and here come some of our chorus who may bear a burden enter chorus here goes then   song since the preference we know is for pageantry and show twere a pity the public to balk  and when people appear quite unable to hear it is undoubtedly needless to talk let your shakespeares and jonsons go hang go hang let your otways and drydens go drown give us but elephants and white bulls enough and well take in all the town brave boys ii or if tardily the sound travels all the house around twixt the action and words there is a breach and it seems as if macbeth half a minute after death on his back made his last dying speech let your shakespeares etc iii when on matters of state stage heroes debate intelligence so slowly is got twere better they began on the newinvented plan and with telegraphs transmitted you the plot let your shakespeares etc iv but our house here is so small that there is no need to bawl and the summer will rapidly pass so we hope you will think fit to hear the actors a bit till the elephants and bulls come from grass then let shakespeare and jonson go hang go hang let your otways and drydens go drown give em but elephants and white bulls enough and they will take in all the town  brave boys finis
