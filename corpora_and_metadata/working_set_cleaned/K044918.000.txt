per  00   s  d for  0   s  d for      entered at stationers hall  the shepherd of salisburyplain mr johnson a very worthy charitable gentleman was traveling some time ago across one of those vast plains which are well known in wiltshire it was a fine summers evening and he rode slowly that he might have leisure to admire god in the works of his creation for this gentleman was of opinion that a walk or a ride was as proper a time as any to think about good things for which reason on such occasions he seldom thought so much about his money or his trade or public news as at other times that he might with more ease and satisfaction enjoy the pious thoughts which the visible works of the great maker of heaven and earth are intended to raise in the mind  his attention was all of a sudden called off by the barking of a shepherds dog and looking up he spied one of those little huts which are here and there to be seen on these great downs and near it was the shepherd himself busily employed with his dog in collecting together his vast flock of sheep as he drew nearer he perceived him to be a clean welllooking poor man near fifty years of age his coat though at first it had probably been of one dark color had been in a long course of years so often patched with different sorts of cloth that it was now become hard to say which had been the original color but this while it gave a plain proof of the shepherds poverty equally proved the exceeding neatness industry and good management of his wife his stockings no less proved her good housewifery for they were entirely covered with darns of different colored worsted but had not a hole in them and his shirt though nearly as coarse as the sails of a ship was as white as the drifted snow and neatly mended where time had either made a rent or worn it thin this is a rule of judging by which one shall seldom be deceived if i meet with a labourer hedging ditching or mending the highways with his stockings and shirt tight and whole however mean and bad his other garments are i have seldom fared on visiting his cottage to find that also clean and well ordered and his wife notable and worthy of encouragement whereas a poor woman who will be lying abed or gossipping with her neighbors when she ought to be fitting out her husband in a cleanly manner will seldom be found to be very good in other respects  this was not the case with our shepherd and mr johnson was not more struck with the decency of his mean and frugal dress than with his open honest countenance which bore strong marks of health cheerfulness and spirit  mr johnson who was on a journey and somewhat fearful from the appearance of the sky that rain was at no great distance accosted the shepherd with asking what sort of weather he thought it would be on the morrow  it will be such weather as pleases me answered the shepherd though the answer was delivered in the mildest and civilest tone that could be imagined the gentleman thought the words themselves rather rude and surly and asked him how that could be because replied the shepherd it will be such weather as shall please god and whatever pleases him always pleases me  mr johnson who delighted in good men and good things was very well satisfied with his reply for he justly thought that though an hypocrite may easily contrive to appear better than he really is to a stranger and that no one should be too soon trusted merely for having a few good words in his mouth yet as he knew that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks he always accustomed himself to judge favorably of those who had a serious deportment and solid manner of speaking it looks as if it proceeded from a good habit said he and though i may now and then be deceived by it yet it has not often happened to me to be so whereas if a man accosts me with an idle dissolute vulgar indecent or profane expression i have never been deceived in him but have generally on inquiry found his character to be as bad as his language gave me room to expect  he entered into conversation with the shepherd in the following manner yours is a troublesome life honest friend said he to be sure sir replied the shepherd it is not a very lazy life but it is not near so toilsome as that which my great master led for my sake and he had every state and condition of life at his choice and chose a hard one  while i only submit to the lot that is appointed me  you are exposed to great cold and heat said the gentleman  true sir said the shepherd but then i am not exposed to great temptations and so throwing one thing against another god is pleased to contrive to make things more equal than we poor ignorant shortsighted creatures are apt to think david was happier when he kept his fathers sheep on such a plain as this and singing some of his own psalms perhaps than ever he was when he became king of israel and judah and i dare say we should never have had some of the most beautiful texts in all those fine psalms if he had not been a shepherd which enabled him to make so many fine comparisons and similitudes as one may say from a country life flocks of sheep hills and valleys and fountains of water  you think then said the gentleman that a laborious life is a happy one i do sir and more so especially as it exposes a man to fewer sins if king saul had continued a poor laborious man to the end of his days he might have lived happy and honest and died a natural death in his bed at last which you know sir was more than he did but i speak with reverence for it was divine providence overruled all that you know sir and i do not presume to make comparisons besides sir my employment has been particularly honored  moses was a shepherd in the plains of midian  it was to shepherds keeping their flocks by night that the angels appeared in bethlehem to tell the best news the gladdest tidings that ever were revealed to poor sinful men often and often has the thought warmed my poor heart in the coldest night and filled me with more joy and thankfulness than the best supper could have done  here the shepherd stopped for he began to feel that he had made too free and had talked too long but mr johnson was so well pleased with what he said and with the cheerful contented manner in which he said it that he desired him to go on freely for that it was a pleasure to him to meet with a plain man who without any kind of learning but what he had got from the bible was able to talk so well on a subject in which all men high and low rich and poor are equally concerned  indeed i am afraid i make too bold sir for it better becomes me to listen to such a gentleman as you seem to be than to talk in my poor way but as i was saying sir i wonder all working men do not derive as great joy and delight as i do from thinking how god has honored poverty oh sir what great or rich or mighty men have had such honor put on them or their condition as shepherds tentmakers fishermen and carpenters have had  my honest friend said the gentleman i perceive you are well acquainted with scripture yes sir pretty well blessed be god through his mercy i learnt to read when i was a little boy though reading was not so common when i was a child as i am told through the goodness of providence and the generosity of the rich it is likely to become now adays i believe there is no day for the last thirty years that i have not peeped at my bible if we cannot find time to read a chapter i defy any man to say he cannot find time to read a verse and a single text sir well followed and put in practice every day would make no bad figure at the years end three hundred and sixtyfive texts without the loss of a moments time would make a pretty stock a little golden treasury as one may say from new years day to new years day and if children were brought up to it they would look for their text as naturally as they do for their breakfast no laboring man it is true has so much leisure as a shepherd for while the flock is feeding i am obliged to be still and at such times i can now and then tap a shoe for my children or myself which is a great saving to us and while i am doing that i repeat a bit of a chapter which makes the time pass pleasantly in this wild solitary place i can say the best part of the bible by heart i believe i should not say the best part for every part is good but i mean the greatest part i have led but a lonely life and have often had but little to eat but my bible has been meat drink and company to me as i may say and when want and trouble have come upon me i dont know what i should have done indeed sir if i had not had the promises of this book for my stay and support  you have had great difficulties then said mr johnson why as to that sir not more than neighbors fare i have but little cause to complain and much to be thankful but i have had some little struggles as i will leave you to judge i have a wife and eight children whom i bred up in that little cottage which you see under the hill about half a mile off what that with the smoke coming out of the chimney said the gentleman o no sir replied the shepherd smiling we have seldom smoke in the evening for we have little to cook and firing is very dear in these parts it is that cottage which you see on the left hand of the church near that little tuft of hawthorns what that hovel with only one room above and one below with scarcely any chimney how is it possible you can live there with such a family o it is very possible and very certain too cried the shepherd how many better men have been worse lodged how many good christians have perished in prisons and dungeons in comparison of which my cottage is a palace the house is very well sir and if the rain did not sometimes beat down upon us through the thatch when we are a bed i should not desire a better for i have health peace and liberty and no man makes me afraid  well i will certainly call on you before it be long but how can you contrive to lodge so many children we do the best we can sir my poor wife is a very sickly woman or we should always have done tolerably well there are no gentry in the parish so that she has not met with any great assistance in her sickness the good curate of the parish who lives in that pretty parsonage in the valley is very willing but not very able to assist us on these trying occasions for he has little enough for himself and a large family into the bargain yet he does what he can and more than many richer men do and more than he can well afford besides that his prayers and good advice we are always sure of and we are truly thankful for that for a man must give you know sir according to what he has and not according to what he has not  are you in any distress at present said mr johnson no sir thank god replied the shepherd i get my shilling a day and most of my children will soon be able to earn something for we have only three under five years of age only said the gentleman that is a heavy burden not at all god fits the back to it though my wife is not able to do any out of door work yet she breeds up our children to such habits of industry that our little maids before they are six years old can first get a halfpenny and then a penny a day by knitting the boys who are too little to do hard work get a trifle by keeping the birds off the corn for this the farmers will give them a penny or twopence and now and then a bit of bread and cheese into the bargain when the season of crow keeping is over then they glean or pick stones any thing is better than idleness sir and if they do not get a farthing by it i would make them do it just the same for the sake of giving them early habits of labor  so you see sir i am not so badly off as many are nay if it were not that it costs me so much in potecarys stuff for my poor wife i should reckon myself well off nay i do reckon myself well off for blessed be god he has granted her life to my prayers and i would work myself to a natomy and live on one meal a day to add any comfort to her valuable life indeed i have often done the last and thought it no great matter neither  while they were in this part of the discourse a fine plump cherrycheek little girl ran up out of breath with a smile on her young happy face and without taking any notice of the gentleman cried out with great joy  look here father only see how much i have got today mr johnson was much struck with her simplicity but puzzled to know what was the occasion of this great joy on looking at her he perceived a small quantity of coarse wool some of which had found it is way through the holes of her clean but scanty and ragged woollen apron the father said this has been a successful day indeed molly but dont you see the gentleman molly now made a curtsey down to the very ground while mr johnson inquired into the cause of the mutual satisfaction which both father and daughter had expressed at the unusual good fortune of the day  sir said the shepherd poverty is a great sharpener of wits  my wife and i cannot endure to see our children poor as they are without shoes and stockings not only on account of the pinching cold which cramps their poor little limbs but because it degrades and debases them and poor people who have but little regard to appearances will seldom be found to have any great regard for honesty and goodness i dont say this is always the case but i am sure it is so too often now shoes and stockings being very dear we could never afford to get them without a little contrivance i must show you how i manage about the shoes when you condescend to call at our cottage sir as to stockings this is one way we take to help get them my young ones who are too little to do much work sometimes wander at odd hours over the hills for the chance of finding what little wool the sheep may drop when they rub themselves as they are apt to do in the bushes this piece of frugal industry is not imaginary but a real fact as is the character of the shepherd and his uncommon knowledge of the scriptures  these scattered bits of wool the children pick out of the brambles which i see have torn sad holes in mollys apron today they carry this wool home and when they have got a pretty parcel together their mother cards it for we can sit and card in the chimney corner when she is not able to wash or work about house the biggest girl then spins it it does very well for us without dying for poor people must not stand for the color of their stockings after this our little boys knit it for themselves while they are employed in keeping crows in the fields and after they get home at night as for the knitting the girls and their mother do that is chiefly for sale which helps to pay our rent  mr johnson lifted up his eyes in silent astonishment at the shifts which honest poverty can make rather than beg or steal and was surprised to think how many ways of subsisting there are which those who live at their ease little suspect he secretly resolved to be more attentive to his own petty expenses than he had hitherto been and to be more watchful that nothing was wasted in his family  but to return to the shepherd mr johnson told him that as he must needs be at his friends house who lived many miles off that night he could not as he wished to do make a visit to his cottage at present but i will certainly do it said he on my return for i long to see your wife and her nice little family and to be an eye witness of her neatness and good management the poor mans tears started into his eyes on hearing the commendation bestowed on his wife and wiping them off with the sleeve of his coat for he was not worth a handkerchief in the world he said  oh sir you just now i am afraid called me an humble man but indeed i am a very proud one proud exclaimed mr johnson i hope not  pride is a great sin and as the poor are liable to it as well as the rich so good a man as you seem to be ought to guard against it sir said he you are right but i am not proud of myself god knows i have nothing to be proud of i am a poor sinner but indeed sir i am proud of my wife she is not only the most tidy notable woman on the plain but she is the kindest wife and mother and the most contented thankful christian that i know last year i thought i should have lost her in a violent fit of the rheumatism caught by going to work too soon after her lyingin i fear for it is but a bleak coldish place as you may see sir in winter and sometimes the snow lies so long under the hill that i can hardly make myself a path to get out and buy a few necessaries in the next village and we are afraid to send out the children for fear they should be lost when the snow is deep so as i was saying the poor soul was very bad indeed and for several weeks lost the use of all her limbs except her hands a merciful providence spared her the use of these so that when she could not turn in her bed she could contrive to patch a rag or two for her family she was always saying had it not been for the great goodness of god she might have had the palsy instead of the rheumatism and then she could have done nothing  but nobody had so many mercies as she had  i will not tell you what we suffered during that bitter weather sir but my wifes faith and patience during that trying time were as good a lesson to me as any sermon i could hear and yet mr jenkins gave us very comfortable ones too that helped to keep up my spirits  one sunday afternoon when my wife was at the worst as i was coming out of church for i went one part of the day and my eldest daughter the other so my poor wife was never left alone as i was coming out of church i say mr jenkins the minister called out to me and asked me how my wife did saying he had been kept from coming to see her by the deep fall of snow and indeed from the parsonagehouse to my hovel it was quite impassable i gave him all the particulars he asked and i am afraid a good many more for my heart was quite full he kindly gave me a shilling and said he would certainly try to pick out his way and come and see her in a day or two  while he was talking to me a plain farmerlooking gentleman in boots who stood by listened to all i said but seemed to take no notice it was mr jenkinss wifes father who was come to pass the christmas holidays at the parsonagehouse i had always heard him spoken of as a plain frugal man who lived close himself but was remarked to give away more than any of his showaway neighbors  well i went home with great spirits at this seasonable and unexpected supply for we had tapped our last sixpence and there was little work to be had on account of the weather i told my wife i was not come back empty handed no i dare say not says she you have been serving a master who fills the hungry with good things though he sends the rich empty away true mary says i we seldom fail to get good spiritual food from mr jenkins but today he has kindly supplied our bodily wants she was more thankful when i showed her the shilling than i dare say some of your great people are when they get a hundred pounds  mr johnsons heart smote him when he heard such a value set upon a shilling surely said he to himself i will never waste another but he said nothing to the shepherd who thus pursued his story  next morning before i went out i sent part of the money to buy a little ale and brown sugar to put into her water gruel which you know sir made it nice and nourishing i went out to cleave wood in a farmyard for there was no standing out on the plain after such a snow as had fallen in the night i went with a lighter heart than usual because i had left my poor wife a little better and comfortably supplied for this day and i now resolved more than ever to trust in god for the supplies of the next when i came back at night my wife fell a crying as soon as she saw me this i own i thought but a bad return for the blessings she had so lately received and so i told her o said she it is too much we are too rich i am now frightened not lest we should have no portion in this world but for fear we should have our whole portion in it look here john so saying she uncovered the bed whereon she lay and showed me two warm thick new blankets i could not believe my own eyes sir because when i went out in the morning i had left her with no other covering than our little old thin blue rug i was still more amazed when she put half a crown into my hand telling me she had had a visit from mr jenkins and mr jones the latter of whom had bestowed all these good things upon us thus sir have our lives been crowned with mercies my wife got about again and i do believe under providence it was owing to these comforts for the rheumatism sir without blankets by night and flannel by day is but a baddish job especially to people who have little or no fire she will always be a weakly body but thank god her soul prospers and is in health but i beg your pardon sir for talking on at this rate not at all not at all said mr johnson i am much pleased with your story you shall certainly see me in a few days good night so saying he slipped a crown into his hand and rode off surely said the shepherd goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life as he gave the money to his wife when he got home at night  as to mr johnson he found abundant matter for his thoughts during the rest of his journey on the whole he was more disposed to envy than to pity the shepherd i have seldom seen said he so happy a man it is a sort of happiness which the world could not give and which i plainly see it has not been able to take away this must be the true spirit of religion i see more and more that true goodness is not merely a thing of words and opinions but a living principle brought into everycommon action of a mans life what else could have supported this poor couple under every bitter trial of want and sickness no my honest shepherd i do not pity but i respect and even honor thee and i will visit thy poor hovel on my return to salisbury with as much pleasure as i am now going to the house of my friend  if mr johnson keeps his word in sending me the account of his visit to the shepherds cottage i shall be very glad to entertain my readers with it and shall

walks he shall attend and all my midnight hours defend when in the sultry glebe i faint or on the thirsty mountain pant to fertile vales and dewy meads my weary wandering steps he leads where peaceful rivers soft and slow amid the verdant landscape flow though in the paths of death i tread with gloomy horrors overspread my steadfast heart shall fear no ill for thou o lord art with me still thy friendly crook shall give me aid and guide me through the dreadful shade though in a bare and rugged way through devious lonely wilds i stray thy bounty shall my pains beguile the barren wilderness
