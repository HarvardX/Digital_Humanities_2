the argument fingal king of morven returning home victorious from the expedition in ireland which is celebrated in the epic poem bearing his name made a feast to which all his chiefs maronnan and aldo excepted were invited the neglect seems to have been accidental however they resented it so strongly as to abandon their native country and enter into the service of erragon king of sora a name given to some part of scandinavia here lorma the beautiful wife of erragon seeing aldo by chance his reputation as a warrior being very high fell in love with him he returned her passion and they fled into morven erragon pursuing them invaded that kingdon with a powerful force and slew aldo in single combat but was himself slain by gaul the son of morni and his army defeated this is the subject of the ensuing poem which is beautiful sentimental and interesting it was delivered by ossian after becoming blind to a culdee or christian hermit who led a recluse life near him and whose sacred hymns he imagined were composed in honor of his deceased chiefs or addresses to the spirits in the air  the battle of lora a poem son of the distant land within whose cell calm peace and heavenly contemplation dwell what notes of warbling melody are these that pierce thy grove and sigh upon the breeze though loud the impetuous torrent in mine ear the voice of songs a tuneful voice i hear perhaps you call your countrys chiefs to mind or praise the spirits in the posting wind son of the rock cast over the plain thine eyes among the heath thou see green tombs arise the rank grass whistles round and rising stones mark the sad spot where lie the heros bones thou lonely dweller of the rock can see but ah that blessing is not left to me in vain these eyes roll round in search of light for ossians eyes are quenched in endless night down pours the mountain stream from yonder source and round the green hill forms its winding course tufted with moss four stones their tops uprear above the withered grass two trees are near their heavy branches bent beneath the storm here sleeps dread erragon thy mouldering form thee erragon this narrow house contains no more thy shell resounds through soras plains no more will thou the sword in battle wield dark in thy hall and useless hangs thy shield scarce is thy blood upon our mountains dry sovereign of ships  and low the valiant lie love thou the song son of the secret cell attend while loras bloody fight i tell though long forgotten on the spacious plain and scarce the marks of ruthless war remain so when hoarse thunders bellow through the sky a thousand spirits from the caves reply blue lightnings round the hills of morven play gleaming pale horrors on the doubtful day gradual the storm subsides the horizon clears a settled calm the faded landscape cheers the golden sun revives the drooping isle the rough rocks glitter and the mountains smile from ullins rolling waves we steered our way our ships now entered conas spacious bay loose hung our sails we spurned the foaming flood and heard the tempest howl through morvens wood the kings horn sounds  at once the startled deer roused from their coverts fled the danger near thick poured our arrows and the festal board was soon with choice of smoking viands stored blithe on the rocks we reveld in delight swaran our mortal foe had fallen in fight two heroes at the feast had been forgot their bosoms burned with rage and blackening thought in secret round they glanced their kindled eyes their indignation spoke in bursting sighs close they conferred they threw their spears to earth obscuring like two murky clouds our mirth so on the settled sea blue mists arise in vapory volumes darkening to the skies they glitter in the sun but seamen fear the luster short and rising tempests near  loose my white sails well catch the western breeze maronnan spoke well plough the northern seas  we fought his battles  aldo yet forgot  at fingals feast  since such our injured lot  to foreign lands well bear our martial might  and strengthen erragon in dubious fight  his post is terror and his eyes are flame  war points his spear and death attends his name  his ecchoing battles shall our swords renown  and with immortal wreaths of glory crown snatching their swords and shields they quickly sought lumars wished bay and to the shore were brought just as returning from the chase was seen the chief of bounding steeds of haughty mein gloom wrapped his face he murmuring as he went a smothered song seemed lost in dark intent gladly the strangers at his feasts he saw and to his foes their glittering arms gave law brave aldo once returning from the fight was seen by lorma erragons delight his beauteous wife  and then in luckless hour she first acknowledged loves imperious power aldo she saw but like an evening sun glancing an upward beam his race now run her head she leaned on her right arm reclined her darkbrown locks loose floated in the wind still as she looked high heaved her breasts of snow quick throbbd her heart and tears unbidden flow the pearly drop her newborn passion spoke and in the air in sighs her sorrows broke three days she pined dissembled joy her grief concealed the fourth came winged with kind relief the hero clasped her in his vigorous arms and over the briny flood conveyed her charms to conas bay to fingals lofty tower there safe from erragons vindictive power when lo in wrath the king of morven rose and said shall i defend thee from thy foes  what shall fingal a ravisher befriend  proudhearted aldo how can i defend  who will my people in their halls receive  the feast of strangers who hereafter give  hence youth of feeble hand avoid the brave  thy guilt conceal in some deserted cave  while we prepare with soras king to fight  who threatens like black tempests in the night  spirit of noble trenmor say shall peace  never bless my age shall fingal never cease  from wars alarms but born amid the fight  must blood his progress mark to endless night  yet never were the weak by me distressed  never my sword the unequal combat pressed  oh morven yes thy raging storms i know  in time my stately towers shall overthrow  when of my children all in battle slain  naught but their tombs shall on the heath remain  when none survive the noble youths to mourn  when none in selmas mouldering shades sojourn  feeble in arms perhaps a race may come  who scarce will know where rises fingals tomb  yet in the song shall flourish his renown  in song to future times transmitted down as round the turbid spirits of the night are summoned to convene on morvens height the gathering tempests in vindictive hour which he prepares on foreign realms to pour round erragon now landed on the coast embodied close so rolled his martial host while to the king of shields his bard he sent charging him thus to utter his intent  tell him the fight of thousands we demand  or else possession of his hilly land the sovereign sitting in his hall was found the grave companions of his youth around for the young heroes thunderbolts of war were at the chase or in the desert far the sages told what other times had seen and what their deeds in earlier days had been when narthmor king of streamy lora came strong though in years and of illustrious name  this is no time began the chief to hear  the song of other days the foe so near  fierce erragon advances on the strand  and lifts ten thousand swords against the land  among his chiefs he stalks with gloomy pace  like the dark moon when meteors shroud her face  come daughter of my love then said fingal  bosmina come from thy sequestered hall  the rough war threatens be it thine to save  the land from blood the soldier from the grave  to gallant erragon this message bear  say we for him the festal board prepare  the peace of heroes we request and say  the wealth of aldo at his feet we lay  take thou the strangers steeds  they are not slow  narthmor and with the maid of morven go  bosmina haste our youths are distant far  and bending age unequal is to war to soras gazing bands bosmina bright shone forth as on a cloud a beam of light her left hand with a sparkling shell was graced a golden arrow in her right was placed as when the solar rays a passage find through envious clouds rent by the rising wind the vale rejoices in the genial heat smiling the king advanced the maid to meet thus mildly blushing she began to speak  thy royal presence we in selma seek  for thee the feast is spread by morvens king  i will be thy guide provided peace you bring  listen famed warrior then to our request  of peace accept and let the dark sword rest  the wealth of kings we offer if you choose  nor you to hear what aldo says refuse  an hundred steeds he gives that own the rein  never a swifter race devoured the plain  an hundred maids from distant lands he gives  beneath the sky not brighter beauty lives  an hundred hawks all well inured to game  of which none haggard ever missed their aim  an hundred girdles also shall be thine  such when they round highbosomd women twine  gives sudden ease to travails fiercest throes  and their vast virtue every matron knows  ten shells with gems inlaid which ours we call  shall luster beam through soras lofty hall  trembling upon their stars blue waters shine  and to the eye appear like sparkling wine  the worlds great kings lords of the distant seas  once quaffd delicious beverage from these  they all are thine  or lorma fair shall grace  thy tower again and pant in thy embrace  though much fingal the generous aldo loves  thus erragon his wish for peace he proves  fingal who never did a hero wrong  never injustice though his arm be strong  soft voice of cona soras king replied  tell him he does in vain the feast provide  unless he bow to my superior sway  and at my feet his spoils submissive lay  the shields of other times let him resign  and let me all his fathers swords call mine  these in my hall so shall my sons behold  and say those arms were once fingals the bold  never shall they behold them in thy hall  never so low shall morvens monarch fall  still are they grasped by the firm hand of might  by heroes who never yielded in the fight bosmina spoke by patriot pride alarmed and kindling passion all her visage warmed  king of reecchoing sora too she said  thou art to death by this thy pride betrayed  for on our hills the storms begin to lower  which must thy numerous ranks and thee devour now selmas towering walls bosmina sought silent she went and fingal read her thought in strength he rose his silver locks he shook the sounding mail of trenmor then he took his fathers shield  darkness over selma spread when on his spear his outstretchd hand he laid myriads of howling ghosts around were heard and many a gallant heros fall was feared stern joy in each old warriors visage glows while on they pressed to meet their countrys foes the feats of former times their minds employ the fame which those who fall in war enjoy when lo the panting dogs upon the plain were seen where trathail long in dust had lain fingal then knew his youthful heroes near and stopped the thunder of his bold career first oscar  mornis son  and nemis race then fercuth showed his cloudy form and face dermid his dark hair sporting in the wind and ossian last o stranger came behind propt by my spear i leapt each little stream and sung  old times and actions past my theme of mighty men i thought  when near at hand wars dismal din was echoed through the land for hardy fingal struck his bossy shield a thousand swords unsheathed wave over the field three greyhaird sons of song then lift the voice of harmony a mournful theme their choice with sounding step in youthful prowess strong tremendous to the view we rushed along so pours impetuous through the narrow vale the drifting storm of sleet and driving hail on the green hill fingal now sat reclined his glittering standard fluttered in the wind the tough companions of his youth were near graceful their waving locks of age appear now he beheld his sons in war arise and heartfelt pleasure sparkled in his eyes for midst the lightning of their swords he saw from their forefathers deeds they took their law like the fierce torrent of a wintry night stout erragon advanced of matchless might death trackd his footsteps wheresoeer he came the ranks were thind as heaths consumed by flame  who says fingal comes like the bounding roe  the heart which we in ecchoing cona know  his bright shield glitters on his manly side  his armor clangs but mournful is his pride  he meets with erragon  how big the strife   the battle of the chiefs  they toil for life   so when in air high rules the tempests rage  in combat fierce appalling ghosts engage  son of the hill thou fallst distained with blood  from thy white bosom streams lifes crimson flood  ah hapless lorma thy hard fate deplore  weep wretched woman aldo is no more the heros spear the king of sora took and on his body cast a pitying look round on the foe his deathful eyes then threw when gaul came forth to virtue ever true who can the conflict of the heroes tell their wondrous deeds  the royal stranger fell  sons of loved cona loud brave fingal cried  hold deaths red hand and stop the purple tide  for ah the great his last in dust has groaned  and much in sora is his fall bemoaned  the traveller shall to his hall repair  and wonder at the silence reigning there  stranger the king is levelled with the dust  his houses joy  who in their strength may trust  hark  a shrill voice quick through his woods it passed  perhaps his spirit that bestrides the blast  but he is distant far  on morven low  fell erragon beneath a foreign foe thus spoke fingal the tuneful song of peace the bard raised high  the swords from slaughter cease the feeble foe was spared for better days while added glories round the the standard of fingal was called the sunbeam from its being richly adorned with jewels sunbeam blaze within that tomb the conquered chief we laid and i the song of lamentation made often over the sky when nights dark vapors come the heros mourning ghost appears to some pale sorrow say they on his face impressed and halfformd sighs seem laboring in his breast blessed soras king be thy departed soul thine arm the tide of battle could control fair lorma sat and fast descended night through aldos hall a flaming oak gave light with expectation big her bosom burned sad she looked out but saw him not returned  where can my joy my comfort thus remain  conas loved hunter what can thee detain  you promised to return ever setting day  has then the deer been distant far away  do the bleak winds sigh round thee on the heath  where murmuring spirits guard their bones beneath  where is my friend where where my aldo gone  wherefore am i with strangers left alone  my aldo never yet neglectful proved  come from thy ecchoing hills my best beloved often to the gate she turns her swimming eyes often listens as the rustling breezes rise  it is aldos tread  joy lightens in her face  it is not he  how short the smiling space now anxious thoughts again her visage shroud as the pale moon behind a watery cloud  return my love nor thus my hopes defraud   return my love  again i will look abroad  soft in the east the queen of stars is bright  and the calm lake reflects her silver light  shall i not see his faithful dogs appear  his faithful dogs would tell my hero near  when shall his wellknown accents on the wind  though distant loud revive my pensive mind  come from thy towering hills  my love appear   thy lorma calls  he is silent  much i fear  as when a midnight shower invests the plain the moon a dusky beam darts through the rain his shivering ghost upon a rock was seen the shade she followed over the gloomy green for now she knew the hero was no more i heard her in the wind her fate deplore i heard her mourning like the gales that pass over yon cave that sigh among the grass she came she found the spot where aldo lay her voice grew faint and gradual died away pale as the vapor rising over the lake she rolled her heavy eyes nor more she spoke few were her days in cona when she died and beautys blossom withered in its pride fingal commanded and his bards proclaim in melancholy song her deathless fame morvens fair daughters once in every year drop over her claycold grave a pitying tear when autumns blasts upon the hills appear son of the land far distant from our own whose dwelling is the field of fair renown o let thy song be sometimes tuned to those who fell in battle thence their fame arose so their thin ghosts around thee shall rejoice and on a moonbeam lorma hear thy voice when in thy cave thou layst thee down by night thou shall behold her in the humid light and thou will own that she indeed was fair though wet her cheek and wan her face with care morar a fragment the rains dispersed the storm of wind is past no more i shiver in the dreary blast calm is the noon the burning lamp of day from hill to hill pursues his circling way a rising rainbow bends across the skies and fleecy clouds display their varying dies red pours the sudden stream over yonder steep and through the valley spreads with murmuring sweep how softly plaintive sounds it on mine ear yet softer far yon mourning voice i hear it is alpins  he in sadly soothing strain laments some gallant youth untimely slain alpin the son of song his head of snow bends under age and tears his eyes overflow say son of song why on the silent hill these lonely bounds thy sad complainings fill why like the wave upon the desert shore or blasts through wintry woods do thou thy fate deplore alpin ryno my friend these heartsprung tears are shed this voice of woe is raised for morar dead though tall thy stature on the hill is seen and fair thy beauty on the level green yet thou must fall like him while all around thy tomb  the voice of sorrow shall resound unstrung thy bow shall lie within the hall nor echo from the hills her huntsman call swift were thou morar as the mountain roe wrath over thy face diffused a fiery glow descending furious as december storm thy sword like lightning could the field deform thy voice expressed the torrent after rain and echoed with heavens thunder through the plain beneath his warrior arm what numbers fell thou can o genius of my country tell his arm mowed down the valiant and the great as falls before the scythe the ripened wheat but how serene thy brow beheld afar returning mildly glorious from the war thy face appeared the sun when rains subside or shone the gentler moon at midnight tide calm as the bosom of the lucid lake when not a whispering breeze remains awake alas how narrow is thy place become how low how darksome thine eternal home three paces round outmeasure now thy grave o morar late the mighty and the brave no other witness of his fame is seen save three rude stones whose tops are mossd with green beneath yon leafless solitary tree sad emblem of decayed mortality through the long grass where moans the passing wind the grave of gallant morar there you will find morar the mightys fallen  he is no more  no mothers sighs his hapless fate deplore no maid his loss bewails in plaintive strains nor pours out tears of love upon his cold remains for ah the dame is dead that gave him birth and morglans lovely daughter laid in earth who who is he comes tottering over the plain scarce can his staff his feeble limbs sustain grief marks his furrowed face his hoary head is white with age his eyes with tears are red it is thy father morar  yes  it is he  thy hopeless father  he had none but thee  often when thy gallant actions fame has sung how over the tale enraptured has he hung yet ah till now he heard not of the wound that brought his darling breathless to the ground long like an oak he flourished on the plains ah why this blow to shatter his remains thy son is deaf  weep wretched father weep  low lie the dead and heavy is their sleep their pillow earth with them through one long night he sleeps for ever ravished from thy sight for ever gone  no more thy voice to hear that voice that used his warlike soul to cheer when will the morning of the grave arrive to bid the slumberer in the dust revive thou bravest of the sons of men farewell who could the first in every field excel the field no more shall find thy sword displayed whose edge beamed lightning through the darkest shade thy race is fallen  no son preserves thy name yet shall this verse immortalize thy fame and thy fair deeds shall unborn ages tell how mighty morar lived how fought how fell  the dirge a fragment dark autumn rests upon the mountains brow while gray mists hover on the hills below loud over the barren heath the whirlwind howls hoarse through the narrow plain the river rolls on yonder mount beneath the lonely shade of that old oak are connals ashes laid the withered leaf first whirled awhile in air quits the light breeze and mourning settles there round when the silver regent of the night rules heavens high vault and pours her softer light in her pale beams departed spirits play too weak to bear the stronger blaze of day and by the lonely hunter often are seen as musing slow he stalks along the green who connal to their source thy sires can trace who can recount the fathers of thy race like the stout oak that on the mountain side meets the loud storm and braves its furious pride firm stood their ranks upon the burnished field and taught the boldest of their foes to yield uptorn thy root beneath the turf you lie  who mighty connal shall thy place supply here clashd the warrior arms and here around the dying groaned who strewn the guilty ground here connal fell  with mourning and dismay the wars of fingal marked the bloody day thy arm was like a tempest from the north like lightning gleamd thy falchion when drawn forth thy height a rock did on the plain appear thine eyes a fiery furnace flaming near louder than fighting winds thy voice was found scattering confusion wild the valleys round the strongest by thy valor were overthrown as a boys staff hews tender thistles down dargo the chief ambitious fierce and proud advanced like an impending thundercloud dargo the strong who never missed his blow dark and contracted was his sullen brow his eyes were like two caves within a rock bright rose their swords and fearful was the shock behind in armor bright crimora fair came watchful on old rinvals orphancare bent was her bow and loose her curling hair long had she sighed for connals manly charms and him she sought amid the din of arms at dargos heart she aimed the erring shaft and her loved connals dearest blood it quaffd he falls  as on the plain a mighty oak or a rough rock from its foundation broke he bleeds  unhappy maid  yet no relief her connal dies  verse cannot paint her grief what shall she do  the long long night she mourns  detested day all comfortless returns  my love my friend she cries  his soul is fled  in vain you weep no tears awake the dead woeworn at length death gives her anguish rest and her last breath she pours on connals breast enclosed they peaceful lie within this tomb both in the pride of youth and beautys bloom upsprings the grass beneath the unlettered stone while mournful in the shade i sit alone and hear the sighing wind their fate bemoan full then their memory pours upon my mind where shall the muse alas their fellow find now undisturbed together ye may sleep sacred the mountain tomb your bones shall keep connal and crimora an elegy crimora who who is he that skirts the hill afar in course effulgent as the morning star or as a western cloud in bright array tinged by the flame of fastdescending day loud as the hollow wind his voice i hear sweet as the song of carryl to the ear it is my love encasd with shining steel what joys what bliss ineffable i feel shortlived i fear for sorrow shades his face  say connal lives great fingals hardy race why the dark brow  to me thy woes impart  ah they already tear my troubled heart  connal they live my love  two hours had passed of morn when i beheld them from the chase return they crossed like streaming light over yonder fields the solar ray reflected from their shields i saw them in a line the hill descend  some sad event my love the times portend fate has this melancholy gloom impressed and sighs unwonted heave my boding breast give me my arms  the task of war be mine  our youth are up in armor clasped they shine tomorrow dargo comes to try our force dire will the conflict be and red the warring course enormous dargo comes renowned for might he calls the race of fingal to the fight the sons of wounds and battle he defies and clashing arms shall thunder through the skies  crimora as gray mists thicken in autumnal air on the big waves i saw his sails appear i saw his vessels anchor near the strand and soon the mighty dargo came to land and all his warlike train a numerous band  connal they shall repent they touched this warlike shore bring me the shield the soldier rinval wore thy fathers buckler  thus with livid light the moon full orbd gleams through the wintry night  crimora this shield o connal to thine arm i bind yet oh retain old rinvals fate in mind for no defense in this my father found but bit in agonies of death the ground here pierced stern gaurors spear  the warrior fell and who my connal who thy fate can tell  connal yes  i may fall indeed if such my fate remember glory shortened connals date raise thou my tomb  so shall my fame survive kept by the gentle hand of love alive a mound of earth or rustic pile of stones may mark the grave that covers connals bones though thou crimora to my doting sight art dearer far than to the blind is light though far less pleasure wafts the summer gale to him who toils incessant at the flail though the parched pilgrim in the crystal brook less comfort finds than i in one dear look yet i will go  my country calls to arms  her parent voice more strong than beautys charms adieu crimora  hence appalling gloom  if i should fall  crimora raise my tomb  crimora the martial glow i sympathetic feel give me those arms the sword the lace of steel i will face my love with thee fierce dargos power and aid my connal in the doubtful hour farewell ye rocks of ardven  i no more shall from your summit hear the ocean roar no more shall hear the hunters chearing horn rousing dull echo with the rising morn farewell ye deer that on the mountain side crop the brown heath or in the fern abide farewell ye numerous streams that down the hill soothed my sad hours with many a pleasing rill no more shall we return  the voice of war loud calls to arms  our tombs are distant far  the apparition an elegy upon this hill where constant raves the wind close by a fountains murmur sweet reclined i listening lie while over my drooping head a single tree spreads solitary shade deep rolls the river through the blasted heath the lake with troubled waters swell beneath swift down the hill the motly tribe descend no whistling cowherds nigh at hand attend no hunters horn alarms the distant hill though noon the scene is silent all and still sad as the dove when by its mate forlorn alone i sit the long long day and mourn how pleasant would the barren heath appear if the loved mistress of my heart were near with her curled tresses floating loose behind while her soft bosom kissed the passing wind but ah the wind unwilling thence to part might bolt with treble bars of ice her heart she mourns her friends that lie beneath the hill the tears i will wipe that from thine eyes distill and to thy fathers house while thee i bring sweet comfort in my charmers ear i will sing ha is it she that yonder beams like light or the full lunar orb in autumn bright the sun just rising over a summer storm less splendid seems than her delicious form she speaks  but ah her voice how weak and low as through the marshy reeds soft breezes blow she returnst thou safe my shilric from the war where are thy friends my love they traveled far of thy destruction on the hill they tell i heard and wept incessant that you fell  he yes i return my love and i alone of all my race beside surviveth none no more they will bless them in your sunny eyes their graves i pild  on yonder plain they rise but on the barren turf why prithee say why over the desert hill alone do stray  she though shilric over the hill thou see me roam my bones are hearsd in their eternal home closed in the wintry house of death i lie grief for thy loss drank all my vitals dry  he yet hear vinella ah she glides away like the gray dawn before the rising day but one word more my love and then depart  behold these tears the offspring of my heart i fear twill break  it is wrung with constant grief  a look a word will waft some kind relief when living fairer than the light were thou but pale and ghastly are thy beauties now her brooding wings should awful silence spread dwell in the gale suspended over my head thence my sad soul with softest accents cheer thy wellknown voice i could for ever hear come on the mountain blast and with the sound disperse the midday silence hovering round for on the summit will i sit alone and by the mossy murmuring fountain moan  finis
