one shilling and sixpence  to his royal highness frederick prince of wales sir the honor your royal highness has done me in the protection you was pleased to give to this tragedy emboldens me to lay it now at your feet and beg your permission to publish it under your royal patronage the favoring and protecting of letters has been in all ages and countries one distinguishing mark of a great prince and that with good reason not only as it shows a justness of taste and elevation of mind but as the influence of such a protection by exciting good writers to labor with more emulation in the improvement of their several talents not a little contributes to the embellishment and instruction of society but of all the different species of writing none has such an effect upon the lives and manners of men as the dramatick and therefore that of all others most deserves the attention of princes who by a judicious approbation of such pieces as tend to promote all public and private virtue may more than by any coercive methods secure the purity of the stage and in consequence thereof greatly advance the morals and politeness of their people how eminently your royal highness has always extended your favor and patronage to every art and science and in a particular manner to dramatick performances is too well known to the world for me to mention it here allow me only to wish that what i have now the honor to offer your royal highness may be judged not unworthy of your protection at least in the sentiments which it inculcates a warm and grateful sense of your goodness to me makes me

expiring lies was called in haste he sent each way his messengers to find him with such a look of ardor and impatience as if this near event was to count tancred of more importance than i comprehend  sigismunda there lies my laura over my tancreds birth a cloud i cannot pierce with princely cost nay with respect which often i have observed stealing at times submissive over his features in belmonts woods my father reared this youth  ah woods where first my artless bosom learnt the sighs of love  he gives him out the son of an old friend a baron of apulia who in the late crusado b avely fell but then it is strange is all his family as well as father dead and all their friends except my sire the generous good siffredi had he a mother sister brother left the last remain of kindred with what pride what rapture might they fly over earth and sea to claim this rising honor of their blood this bright unknown this allaccomplishd youth who charms  too much  the heart of sigismunda laura perhaps your brother knows him better the friend and partner of his freest hours what says rodolpho does he truly credit this story of his birth  laura he has sometimes like you his doubts yet when maturely weighed believes it true as for lord tancreds self he never entertained the slightest thought that vergd to doubt but often laments his state by cruel fortune so illpaird to yours  sigismunda merit

nor half the truth i tell you even with fondness my brother talks for ever of the passion that fires young tancreds breast so much it strikes him he praises love as if he were a lover he blames the false pursuits of vagrant youth calls them gay folly a mistaken struggle against bestjudging nature heaven he says in lavish bounty formed the heart for love in love included all the finer seeds of honor virtue friendship purest bliss   sigismunda virtuous rodolpho  laura then his pleasing theme he varies to the praises of your lover   sigismunda and what my laura says he on that subject  laura he says that though he were not nobly born nature has formed him noble generous brave truly magnanimous and warmly scorning whatever bears the smallest taint of baseness that every easy virtue is his own not learnt by painful labor but inspired implanted in his soul  chiefly one charm he in his graceful character observes that though his passions burn with high impatience and sometimes from a noble heat of nature are ready to fly off yet the least check of ruling reason brings them back to temper and gentle softness  sigismunda true o true rodolpho blessed be thy kindred worth for loving his he is all warmth all amiable fire all quick heroic ardor tempered soft with gentleness of heart and manly reason if virtue were to wear a human form to light it with her dignity and flame then softening mix her smiles and tender graces o she would choose the person of my tancred go on my friend go on and ever praise him the subject knows no bounds nor can i tire while my breast trembles to that sweetest music the heart of woman tastes no truer joy is never flattered with such dear enchantment  it is more than selfish vanity  as when she hears the praises of the man she loves   laura madam your father comes  scene ii siffredi sigismunda laura siffredi to an attendant as he enters lord tancred then is found  attendant my lord he quickly will be here i scarce could keep before him though he bid me speed on to say he would attend your orders  siffredi it is well  retire  you too my daughter leave me  sigismunda i go my father  but how fares the king  siffredi he is no more gone to that awful state where kings the crown wear only of their virtues  sigismunda how bright must then be his  this stroke is sudden he was this morning well when to the chase lord tancred went  siffredi it is true but at his years death gives short notice  dropping nature then without a gust of pain to shake it falls his death my daughter was that happy period which few attain the duties of his day were all discharged and gratefully enjoyed it is noblest blessings calm as evening skies was his pure mind and lighted up with hopes that open heaven when for his last long sleep timely prepared a lassitude of life a pleasing weariness of mortal joy fell on his soul and down he sunk to rest o may my death be such  he but one wish left unfulfilld which was to see count tancred   sigismunda to see count tancred  pardon me my lord   siffredi for what my daughter  but with such emotion why did you start at mention of count tancred  sigismunda nothing  i only hoped the dying king might mean to make some generous just provision for this your worthy charge this noble orphan  siffredi and he has done it largely  leave me now  i want some private conference with lord tancred  scene iii siffredi alone my doubts are but too true  if these old eyes can trace the marks of love a mutual passion has seized i fear my daughter and this prince my sovereign now  should it be so ah there there lurks a brooding tempest that may shake my longconcerted scheme to settle firm the public peace and welfare which the king has made the prudent basis of his will  away unworthy views you shall not tempt me nor interest nor ambition shall seduce my fixed resolve  perish the selfish thought which our own good prefers to that of millions  he comes  my king  unconscious of his fortune  scene iv tancred siffredi tancred my lord siffredi in your looks i read confirmed the mournful news that fly abroad from tongue to tongue  we then at last have lost the good old king  siffredi yes we have lost a father the greatest blessing heaven bestows on mortals and seldom found amidst these wilds of time a good a worthy king  hear me my tancred and i will tell thee in a few plain words how he deserved that best that glorious title it is naught complex it is clear as truth and virtue he loved his people deemed them all his children the good exalted and depressed the bad he spurned the flattering crew with scorn rejected their smooth advice that only means themselves their schemes to aggrandize him into baseness nor did he less disdain the secret breath the whispered tale that blights a virtuous name he sought alone the good of those for whom he was entrusted with the sovereign power well knowing that a people in their rights and industry protected living safe beneath the sacred shelter of the laws encouraged in their genius arts and labors and happy each as he himself deserves are never ungrateful with unsparing hand they will for him provide their filial love and confidence are his unfailing treasure and every honest man his faithful guard  tancred a general face of grief oerspreads the city i marked the people as i hither came in crowds assembled struck with silent sorrow and pouring forth the noblest praise of tears those whom remembrance of their former woes and long experience of the vain illusions of youthful hope had into wise content and fear of change corrected wrung their hands and often casting up their eyes to heaven gave sign of sad conjecture others showed athwart their grief or real or affected a gleam of expectation from what chance and change might bring a mingled murmur run along the streets and from the lonely court of him who can no more assist their fortunes i saw the courtierfry with eager haste all hurrying to constantia  siffredi noble youth i joy to hear from thee these just reflections worthy of riper years  but if they seek constantia trust me they mistake their course  tancred how is she not my lord the late kings sister heir to the crown of sicily the last of our famed norman line and now our queen  siffredi tancred it is true she is the late kings sister the sole surviving offspring of that tyrant william the bad  so for his vices styled who spilt much noble blood and sore oppressed the exhausted land whence grievous wars arose and many a dire convulsion shook the state when he whose death sicilia mourns today william who has and well deserved the name of good succeeding to his fathers throne relieved his countrys woes  but to return  she is the late kings sister born some months after the tyrants death but not next heir  tancred you much surprise me  may i then presume to ask who is  siffredi come nearer noble tancred son of my care i must on this occasion consult thy generous heart which when conducted by rectitude of mind and honest virtues gives better counsel than the hoary head  then know there lives a prince here in palermo the lineal offspring of our famous hero roger the first  tancred great heaven  how far removed from that our mighty founder  siffredi his great grandson sprung from his eldest son who died untimely before his father  tancred ha the prince you mean is he not manfreds son the generous brave unhappy manfred whom the tyrant william you just now mentioned not content to spoil of his paternal crown threw into fetters and infamously murdered  siffredi yes  the same  tancred by heavens i joy to find our norman reign the light of earth amidst these barbarous ages yet rears it is head and shall not from the lance pass to the feeble distaff  but this prince where has he lain concealed  siffredi the late good king by noble pity moved contrived to save him from his dire fathers unrelenting rage and had him reared in private as became his birth and hopes with high and princely nurture till now too young to rule a troubled state by civil broils most miserably torn he in his safe retreat has lain concealed his birth and fortune to himself unknown but when the dying king to me entrusted as to the chancellor of the realm his will his successor he named him  tancred happy youth he then will triumph over his fathers foes over haughty osmond and the tyrants daughter  siffredi ay that is what i dread  that heat of youth there lurks i fear perdition to the state i dread the horrors of rekindled war though dead the tyrant still is to be feared his daughters party still is strong and numerous her friend earl osmond constable of sicily experienced brave highborn of mighty interest better the prince and princess should by marriage unite their friends their interest and their claims then will the peace and welfare of the land on a firm basis rise  tancred my lord siffredi if by myself i of this prince may judge that scheme will scarce succeed  your prudent age in vain will counsel if the heart forbid it  but wherefore fear the right is clearly his and under your direction with each man of worth and steadfast loyalty to back at once the kings appointment and his birthright there is no ground for fear they have great odds against the astonished sons of violence who fight with awful justice on their side all sicily will rouse all faithful hearts will range themselves around prince manfreds son for me i here devote me to the service of this young prince i every drop of blood will lose with joy with transport in his cause  pardon my warmth  but that my lord will never to this decision come  then find the prince lose not a moment to awaken in him the royal soul perhaps he now desponding pines in a corner and laments his fortune that in the narrow bounds of private life he must confine his aims those swelling virtues which from his noble father he inherits  siffredi perhaps regardless in the common bane of youth he melts in vanity and love but if the seeds of virtue glow within him i will awake a higher sense a love that grasps the loves and happiness of millions  tancred why that surmise or should he love siffredi i doubt not it is nobly which will raise and animate his virtues  o permit me to plead the cause of youth  their virtue often in pleasures  enchantment lulled a while forgets itself it sleeps and gayly dreams till great occasion rouse it then all flame it walks abroad with heightened soul and vigor and by the change astonishes the world even with a kind of sympathy i feel the joy that waits this prince when all the powers the expanding heart can wish of doing good whatever swells ambition or exalts the human soul into divine emotions all crowd at once upon him  siffredi ah my tancred nothing so easy as in speculation and at a distance seen the course of honor a fair delightful champian strewn with flowers but when the practice comes when our fond passions pleasure and pride and selfindulgence throw their magic dust around the prospect roughens then dreadful passes craggy mountains rise cliffs to be scaled and torrents to be stemd then toil ensues and perseverance stern and endless combats with our grosser sense often lost and often renewed and generous pain for others felt and harder lesson still our honest bliss for others sacrificed and all the rugged task of virtue quails the stoutest heart of common resolution few get above this turbid scene of strife few gain the summit breathe that purest air that heavenly either which untroubled sees the storm of vice and passion rage below  tancred most true my lord but why thus augure ill you seem to doubt this prince i know him not yet oh methinks my heart could answer for him the juncture is so high so strong the gale that blows from heaven as through the deadest soul might breathe the godlike energy of virtue  siffredi hear him immortal shades of his great fathers  forgive me sir this trial of your heart thou thou art he  tancred siffredi  siffredi tancred thou thou art the man of all the many thousands that toil upon the bosom of this isle by heaven elected to command the rest to rule protect them and to make them happy  tancred manfred my father i the last support of the famed norman line that awes the world i who this morning wandered forth an orphan outcast of all but thee my second father thus called to glory to the first great lot of human kind  o wonderworking hand that in majestic silence sways at will the mighty movements of unbounded nature o grant me heaven the virtues to sustain this awful burden of so many heroes let me not be exalted into shame set up the worthless pageant of vain grandeur meantime i thank the justice of the king who has my right bequeathed me thee siffredi i thank thee  o i never enough can thank thee yes thou have been  thou art  shall be my father thou shall direct my unexperienced years shall be the ruling head and i the hand  siffredi it is enough for me  to see my sovereign assert his virtues and maintain his honor  tancred i think my lord you said the king committed to you his will i hope it is not clogged with any base conditions any clause to tyrannize my heart and to constantia enslave my hand devoted to another the hint you just now gave of that alliance you must imagine wakes my fear but know in this alone i will not bear dispute not even from thee siffredi  let the council be strait assembled and the will there opened thence issue speedy orders to convene this day ere noon the senate where those barons who now are in palermo will attend to pay their ready homage to their king their rightful king who claims his native crown and will not be a king of deeds and parchments  siffredi i go my liege but once again permit me to tell you  now now is the trying crisis that must determine of your future reign o with heroic rigor watch your heart and to the sovereign duties of the king the unequaled pleasures of a god on earth submit the common joys the common passions nay even the virtues of the private man  tancred of that no more they not oppose but aid invigorate cherish and reward each other the kind allruling wisdom is no tyrant  scene v tancred alone now generous sigismunda comes my turn to show my love was not of thine unworthy when fortune bade me blush to look to thee but what is fortune to the wish of love a miserable bankrupt otis poor it is scanty all whatever we can bestow the wealth of kings is wretchedness and want  quick let me find her taste that highest joy the exalted heart can know the mixed effusion of gratitude and love  behold she comes  scene vi tancred sigismunda tancred my fluttering soul was all on wing to find thee my love my sigismunda  sigismunda o my tancred tell me what means this mystery and gloom that lowrs around just now involved in thought my father shot athwart me  you my lord seem strangely moved  i fear some dark event from the kings death to trouble our repose that tender calm we in the woods of belmont so happily enjoyed  explain this hurry what means it say  tancred it means that we are happy beyond our most romantic wishes happy  sigismunda you but perplex me more  tancred it means my fairest that thou art queen of sicily and i the happiest of mankind than monarch more because with thee i can adorn my throne manfred who fell by tyrant williams rage famed rogers lineal issue was my father pausing you droop my love dejected on a sudden you seem to mourn my fortune  the soft tear springs in thy eye  o let me kiss it off  why this my sigismunda  sigismunda royal tancred none at your glorious fortune can like me rejoice  yet me alone of all sicilians it makes unhappy  tancred i should hate it then should throw with scorn the splendid ruin from me  no sigismunda it is my hope with thee to share it whence it draws it is richest value  sigismunda you are my sovereign  i at humble distance   tancred thou art my queen the sovereign of my soul you never reigned with such hant luster such winning charms as now yet thou art still the dear the tender generous sigismunda who with a heart exalted far above those selfish views that charm the common breast stooped from the height of life and courted beauty then then to love me when i seemed of fortune the hopeless outcast when i had no friend none to protect and own me but thy father and would thou claim all goodness to thyself can thou thy tancred deem so dully formed of such gross clay just as i reach the point  a point my wildest hopes could never image  in that great moment full of every virtue that i should then so mean a traitor prove to the best bliss and honor of mankind so much disgrace the human heart as then for the dead form of flattery and pomp the faithless joys of courts to quit kind truth the cordial sweets of friendship and of love the life of life my all my sigismunda i could upbraid thy fears call them unkind cruel unjust an outrage to my heart did they not spring from love  sigismunda think not my lord that to such vulgar doubts i can descend your heart i know disdains the little thought of changing with the vain external change of circumstance and fortune rather thence it would with rising ardor greatly feel a noble pride to show itself the same but ah the hearts of kings are not their own there is a haughty duty that subjects them to chains of state to wed the public welfare and not indulge the tender private virtues some highdescended princess who will bring new power and interest to your throne demands your royal hand  perhaps constantia   tancred she o name her not were i this moment free and disengaged as he who never felt the powerful eye of beauty never sighed for matchless worth like thine i should abhor all thoughts of that alliance her fell father most basely murdered mine and she the daughter supported by his barbarous party still his pride inherits his imperious spirit and insolent pretensions to my throne and can thou deem me then so poorly tame so cool a traitor to my fathers blood as from the prudent cowardice of state ever to submit to such a base proposal detested thought o doubly doubly hateful from the two strongest passions from aversion to this constantia  and from love to thee custom it is true a venerable tyrant over servile man extends her blind dominion the pride of kings enslaves them their ambition or interest lords it over the better passions but vain their talk masked under specious words of station duty and of public good they whom just heaven has to a throne exalted to guard the rights and liberties of others what duty binds them to betray their own for me my freeborn heart shall bear no dictates but those of truth and honor wear no chains but the dear chains of love and sigismunda or if indeed my choice must be directed by views of public good whom shall i choose so fit to grace to dignify a crown and beam sweet mercy on a happy people as thee my love whom place upon my throne but thee descended from the good siffredi it is fit that heart be thine which drew from him whatever can make it worthy thy acceptance  sigismunda cease cease to raise my hopes above my duty charm me no more my tancred  o that we in those blessed woods where first you won my soul had passed our gentle days far from the toil and pomp of courts such is the wish of love of love that with delightful weakness knows no bliss and no ambition but itself but in the worlds full light those charming dreams those fond illusions vanish awful duties the tyranny of men even your own heart where lurks a sense your passion stifles now and proud imperious honor call you from me it is all in vain  you cannot hush a voice that murmrrs here  i must not be persuaded  tancred kneeling hear me thou soul of all my hopes and wishes and witness heaven prime source of love and joy not a whole warring world combined against me it is pride it is splendour it is imposing forms nor interest nor ambition nor the face of solemn state not even thy fathers wisdom shall ever shake my faith to sigismunda trumpets and acclamations heard but hark the public voice to duties calls me which with unwearied zeal i will discharge and thou yes thou shall be my bright reward  yet  ere i go  to hush thy lovely fears thy delicate objections  writes his name take this blank signed with my name and give it to thy father tell him it is my command it be filled up with a most strict and solemn marriagecontract how dear each tie how charming to my soul that more unites me to my sigismunda for thee and for my peoples good to live is all the bliss which sovereign power can give  act ii scene i siffredi alone so far it is well  the late kings will proceeds upon the plan i counseled that prince tancred shall make constantia partner of his throne o great o wished event whence the dire seeds of dark intestine broils of civil war and all it is dreadful miseries and crimes shall be for ever rooted from the land may these dim eyes long blasted by the rage of cruel faction and my countrys woes tired with the toils and vanities of life behold this period then be closed in peace but how this mighty obstacle surmount which love has thrown betwixt love that disturbs the schemes of wisdom still that winged with passion blind and impetuous in it is fond pursuits leaves the greyheaded reason far behind alas how frail the state of human bliss when even our honest passions often destroy it i was to blame in solitude and shades infectious scenes  trust their youthful hearts would i had marked the rising flame that now burns out with dangerous force  my daughter owns her passion for the king she trembling owned it with prayers and tears and tender supplications that almost shook my firmness  and this blank which his rash fondness gave her shows how much to what a wild extravagance he loves  i see no means  it oils my deepest thought  how to control this madness of the king that wears the face of virtue and will thence disdain restraint will from his generous heart borrow new rage even speciously oppose to reason reason  but it must be done my own advice of which i more and more approve the strict conditions of the will highly demand his marriage with constantia or else her party has a fair pretense and all at once is horror and confusion  how issue from this maze  the crouding barons here summoned to the palace meet already to pay their homage and confirm the will on a few moments hangs the public fate on a few hasty moments  ha there shone a gleam of hope  yes  with this very paper i yet will save him  necessary means for good and noble ends can never be wrong in that resistless that peculiar case deceit is truth and virtue  but how hold this lion in the toil  o  will form it of such a fatal thread twist it so strong with all the ties of honor and of duty that his most desperate fury shall not break the honest snare  here is the royal hand  i will beneath it write a perfect ull and absolute agreement to the will which read before the nobles of the realm assembled in the sacred face of sicily constantia present every heart and eye fixed on their monarch every tongue applauding he must submit his dream of love must vanish  it shall be done  to me i know it is ruin but safety to the public to the king i will not reason more i will not listen even to the voice of honor  no  it is fixed i here devote me for my prince and country let them be safe and let me nobly perish behold earl osmond comes without whose aid my schemes are all in vain  scene ii osmond siffredi osmond my lord siffredi i from the council hastened to constantia and have accomplished what we there proposed the princess to the will submits her claims she with her presence means to grace the senate and of your royal charge young tancreds hand accept at first indeed it shocked her hopes of reigning sole this new surprising scene of manfreds son appointed by the king with her jointheir  but i so fully showed the justice of the case the public good and sure established peace which thence would rise joined to the strong necessity that urged her if on sicilias throne she meant to sit as to the wise disposal of the will her high ambition tamed methought besides i could discern that not from prudence merely she to this choice submitted  siffredi noble osmond you have in this done to the public great and signal service yes i must avow it this frank and ready instance of your zeal in such a trying crisis of the state when interest and ambition might have warped your views i own this truly generous virtue upbraids the rashness of my former judgment  osmond siffredi no  to you belongs the praise the glorious work is yours had i not seized improved the wished occasion to root out division from the land and save my country i had been base been infamous for ever it is you my lord to whom the many thousands that by the barbarous sword of civil war had fallen inglorious owe their lives to you the sons of this fair isle from her first peers down to the swain who tills her golden plains owe their safe homes their soft domestic hours and through late time posterity shall bless you you who advised this will  i blush to think i have so long opposed the best good man in sicily  with what impartial care ought we to watch over prejudice and passion nor trust too much the jaundicd eye of party henceforth it is vain delusions i renounce it is hot determinations that confine all merit and all virtue to itself to yours i join my hand with you will own no interest and no party but my country nor is your friendship only my ambition there is a dearer name the name of father by which i should rejoice to call siffredi your daughters hand would to the public weal unite my private happiness  siffredi my lord you have my glad consent to be allied to your distinguished family and merit i shall esteem an honor from my soul i here embrace earl osmond as my friend and son  osmond you make him happy this assent so frank and warm to what i long have wished engages all my gratitude at once in the first blossom it matures our friendship i from this moment vow myself the friend and zealous servant of siffredis house  enter an officer belonging to the court officer to siffredi the king my lord demands your speedy presence  siffredi i will attend him strait  farewell my lord the senate meets there a few moments hence i will rejoin you  osmond there my noble lord we will complete this salutary work will there begin a new auspicious era  scene iii osmond alone siffredi gives his daughter to my wishes  but does she give herself gay young and flattered perhaps engaged will she her youthful heart yield to my harsher uncomplying years i am not formed by flattery and praise by sighs and tears and all the whining trade of love to feed a fairones vanity to charm at once and spoil her these soft arts nor suit my years nor temper these be left to boys and doting age a prudent father by nature charged to guide and rule her choice resigns his daughter to a husbands power who with superior dignity with reason and manly tenderness will ever love her not first a kneeling slave and then a tyrant  scene iv osmond barons osmond my lords i greet you well this wondrous day unites us all in amity and friendship we meet today with open hearts

wind this will perplexes all no tancred never can stoop to these conditions which at once attack his rights his honor and his love those wise old men those plodding grave statepedants forget the course of youth their crooked prudence to baseness verging still forgets to take into their finespun schemes the generous heart that through the cobweb system bursting lays their labors waste  so will this business prove or i mistake the king  back from the pomp he seemed at first to shrink and round his brow i marked a gathering cloud when by his side as if designed to share the public homage he saw the tyrants daughter but confessed at least to me the doubling tempest frowned and shook his swelling bosom when he heard the unjust the base conditions of the will uncertain tossed in cruel agitation he often methought addressed himself to speak and interrupt siffredi who appeared with conscious haste to dread that interruption and hurried on  but hark i hear a noise as if the assembly rose  ha sigismunda oppressed with grief and wrapped in pensive sorrow  along    sigismunda and attendants pass through the back scene laura advances scene vii rodolpho laura laura your highpraisd friend the king is false most vilely false the meanest slave had shown a nobler heart nor grossly thus by the first bait ambition spread been gulled he manfreds son away it cannot be the son of that brave prince could never betray those rights so long usurped from his great fathers which he this day by such amazing fortune had just regained he never could sacrifice all faith all honor gratitude and love even just resentment of his fathers fate and pride itself whatever exalts a man above the grovelling sons of peasantmud all in a moment  and for what why truly for kind permission gracious leave to sit on his own throne with tyrant williams daughter  rodolpho i stand amazed  you surely wrong him laura there must be some mistake  laura there can be none siffredi read his full and free consent before the applauding senate true indeed a small remain of shame a timorous weakness even dastardly in falsehood made him blush to act this scene in sigismundas eye who sunk beneath his perfidy and baseness hence till tomorrow he adjourned the senate  tomorrow fixed with infamy to crown him then leading off his gay triumphant princess he left the poor unhappy sigismunda to bend her trembling steps to that sad home his faithless vows will render hateful to her  he comes  farewell  i cannot bear his presence  scene viii tancred siffredi rodolpho tancred entering to siffredi avoid me hoary traitor  go rodolpho give orders that all passages this way be shut  defend me from a hateful world the bane of peace and honor  then return  what do thou haunt me still o monstrous insult unparalled indignity just heaven was ever king was ever man so treated so trampled into baseness  siffredi here my liege here strike i nor deserve nor ask for mercy  tancred distraction  o my soul  hold reason hold thy giddy seat  o this inhuman outrage unhinges thought  siffredi exterminate thy servant  tancred all all but this i could have borne  but this this daring insolence beyond example this murderous stroke that stabs my peace for ever that wounds me there  there where the human heart most exquisetely feels   siffredi o bear it not my royal lord appease on me your vengeance  tancred did ever tyrant image aught so cruel the lowest slave that crawls upon this earth robbed of each comfort heaven bestows on mortals on the bare ground has still his virtue left the sacred treasures of an honest heart which thou have dared with rash audacious hand and impious fraud in me to violate   siffredi behold my liege that rash audacious hand which not repents its crime  o glorious happy if by my ruin i can save your honor  tancred such honor i renounce with sovereign scorn greatly detest it and its mean adviser have thou not dared beneath my name to shelter  my name for other purposes designed given from the fondness of a faithful heart with the best love overflowing  have thou not beneath thy sovereigns name basely presumed to shield a lie a lie in public uttered to all deluded sicily but know this poor contrivance is as weak as base in such a wretched toil none can be held but fools and cowards  o thy slimsy arts touched by my just my burning indignation shall burst like threads in flame  thy doting prudence but more secures the purpose it would shake had my resolves been wavering and doubtful this would confirm them make them fixed as fate this adds the only motive that was wanting to urge them on through war and desolation  what marry her constantia her the daughter of the fell tyrant who destroyed my father the very thought is madness ere thou see the torch of hymen light these hated nuptials thou shall behold sicilia wrapped in flames her cities razed her valleys drenched with slaughter  love set aside  my pride assumes the quarrel my honor now is up in spite of thee a world combined against me i will give this scattered will in fragments to the winds assert my rights the freedom of my heart crush all who dare oppose me to the dust and heap perdition on thee  siffredi sir it is just exhaust on me your rage i claim it all but for these public threats thy passion utters it is what thou can not do  tancred i cannot ha driven to the dreadful brink of suck dishonor enough to make the tamest coward brave and into fierceness rouse the mildest nature what shall arrest my vengeance who  siffredi thy self  tancred away dare not to justify thy crime that that alone can aggravate it is horror add insolence to insolence  perhaps may make my rage forget   siffredi o let it burst on this gray head devoted to thy service but when the storm has vented all it is fury thou then must hear  nay more i know thou will  wilt hear the calm yet stronger voice of reason thou must reflect that a whole peoples safety the weal of trusted millions should bear down thy self the judge thy fondest partial pleasure thou must reflect that there are other duties a nobler pride a more exalted honor superior pleasures far that will oblige compel thee to abide by this my deed unwarranted perhaps in common justice but which necessity even virtues tyrant with awful voice commanded  yes thou must in calmer hours divest thee of thy love these common passions of the vulgar breast this boiling heat of youth and be a king the lover of thy people  tancred truths illemployd abused to color guilt  a king a king yes i will be a king but not a slave in this will be a king in this my people shall learn to judge how i will guard their rights when they behold me vindicate my own but have i say been treated like a king  heavens could i stoop to such outrageous usage i were a mean a shameless wretch unworthy to wield a scepter in a land of slaves a soil abhorred of virtue should belly my fathers blood belly those very maxims at other times you taught my youth  siffredi  in a softened tone of voice siffredi behold my prince behold thy poor old servant whose darling care these twenty years has been to nurse thee up to virtue who for thee thy glory and thy weal renounces all all interest or ambition can pour forth what many a selfish father would pursue through treachery and crimes behold him here bent on his feeble knees to beg conjure thee with tears to beg thee to control thy passion and save thy self thy honor and thy people kneeling with me behold the many thousands to thy protection trusted fathers mothers the sacred front of venerable age the tender virgin and the helpless infant the ministers of heaven those who maintain around thy throne the majesty of rule and those whose labor scorched by winds and sun feeds the rejoicing public see them all here at thy feet conjuring thee to save them from misery and war from crimes and rapine can there be aught kind heaven in selfindulgence to weigh down these this aggregate of love with which compared the dearest private passion is but the wafted dust upon the balance turn not away  oh is there not some part in thy great heart so sensible to kindness and generous warmth some nobler part to feel the prayers and tears of these the mingled voice of heaven and earth  tancred there is and thou have touched it rise rise siffredi  oh thou have undone me unkind old man  o illentreated tancred which way soever i turn dishonor rears her hideous front  and misery and ruin was it for this you took such care to form me for this imbued me with the quickest sense of shame these finer feelings that never vex the common mass of mortals dully happy in blessed insensibility o rather you should have eard my heart taught me that power and splendid interest lord it still over virtue that gilded by prosperity and pride there is no shame no meanness tempered thus i had been fit to rule a venal world alas what meant thy wantonness of prudence why have you raised this miserable conflict betwixt the duties of the king and man set virtue against virtue  ah siffredi it is thy superfluous thy unfeeling wisdom that has involved me in a maze of error almost beyond retreat  but hold my soul thy steady purpose  tossed by various passions to this eternal anchor keep  there is can be no public without private virtue  then mark me well observe what i command it is the sole expedient now remaining  tomorrow when the senate meets again unfold the whole unravel the deceit nor that alone try to repair it is mischief there all thy power thy eloquence and interest exert to reinstate me in my rights and from thy own dark snares to disembroil me  start not my lord  this must and shall be done or here our friendship ends  however disguised whatever thy pretense thou art a traitor  siffredi i should indeed deserve the name of traitor and even a traitors fate had i so slightly from principles so weak done what i did as ever to disavow it   tancred ha  siffredi my liege expect not this  though practiced long in courts i have not so far learned their subtle trade to veer obedient with each gust of passion i honor thee i venerate thy orders but honor more my duty naught on earth shall ever shake me from that solid rock nor smiles nor frowns   tancred you will not then  siffredi i cannot  tancred away begone  o my rodolpho come and save me from this traitor  hence i say avoid my presence strait and know old man thou my worst foe beneath the mask of friendship who not content to trample in the dust my dearest rights do with cool insolence persist and call it duty had thou not a daughter that protects thee thou should feel the vengeance thou deservest  no reply away  scene ix tancred rodolpho rodolpho what can incense my prince so highly against his friend siffredi  tancred friend rodolpho when i have told thee what this friend has done how played me like a boy a base born wretch who had nor heart nor spirit thou will stand amazed and wonder at my stupid patience  rodolpho i heard with mixed astonishment and grief the kings unjust dishonorable will void in itself  i saw you stung with rage and writhing in the snare just as i went at your command to wait you here  but that was the kings deed not his  tancred o he advised it these many years he has in secret hatched this black contrivance glories in the scheme and proudly plumes him with his traitorous virtue but that was naught rodolpho nothing nothing o that was gentle blameless to what followed i had my friend to sigismunda given to hush her fears in the full gush of fondness a blank signed by my hand  and he  o heavens was ever such a wild attempt  he wrote beneath my name an absolute compliance to this detested will nay dared to read it before my self on my insulted throne his idle pageant placed  oh words are weak to paint the pangs the rage the indignation that whirled from thought to thought my soul in tempest now on the point to burst and now by shame repressed  but in the face of sicily all mad with acclamation what rodolpho what could i do the sole relief that rose to my distracted mind was to adjourn the assembly till tomorrow  but tomorrow what can be done  o it avails not what i care not what is done  my only care is how to clear my faith to sigismunda she thinks me false she cast a look that killed me o i am base in sigismundas eye the lowest of mankind the most perfidious  rodolpho this was a strain of insolence indeed a daring outrage of so strange a nature as stuns me quite   tancred cursed be my timid prudence that dashed not back that moment in his face the bold presumptuous lie  and cursed this hand that from a start of poor dissimulation led off my sigismundas hated rival ah then what poisoned by the false appearance what sigismunda were thy thoughts of me how in the silent bitterness of soul how did thou scorn me hate mankind thy self for trusting to the vows of faithless tancred for such i seemed  i was  the thought distracts me i should have cast a flattering world aside rushed from my throne before them all avowed her the choice the glory of my freeborn heart and spurned the shameful fetters thrown upon it  instead of that  confusion  what i did has clinchd the chain confirmed siffredis crime and fixed me down to infamy  rodolpho my lord blame not the conduct which your situation tore from your tortured heart  what could you do had you so circumstancd in open senate before the astonished public with no friends prepared no party formed affronted thus the haughty princess and her powerful faction supported by this will the sudden stroke abrupt and premature might have recoiled upon your self even your own friends revolted and turned at once the public scale against you besides consider had you then detected in its fresh guilt this action of siffredi you must with signal vengeance have chastisd the treasonable deed  nothing so mean as weak insulted power that dares not punish and how would that have suited with your love his daughter present too trust me your conduct however abhorrent to a heart like yours was fortunate and wise  not that i mean ever to advise submission   tancred heavens submission could i descend to bear it even in thought despise me you the world and sigismunda submission  no  tomorrows glorious light shall flash discovery on this scene of baseness whatever be the risque by heavens tomorrow i will oerturn the dirty lyebuilt schemes of these old men and show my faithful senate that manfreds son knows to assert and wear with undiminishd dignity that crown this unexpected day has placed upon him but this my friend these stormy gusts of pride are foreign to my love  till sigismunda be disabusd my breast is tumult all and can obey no settled course of reason i see her still i feel her powerful image that look where with reproach complaint was mixed big with soft woe and gentle indignation which seemed at once to pity and to scorn me  o let me find her i too long have left my sigismunda to converse with tears a prey to thoughts that picture me a villain but ah how clogged with this accursed state a tedious world shall i now find access her father too  ten thousand horrors crowd into the wild fantastic eye of love  who knows what he may do come then my friend and by thy sisters hand o let me steal a letter to her bosom  i no longer can bear her absence by the just contempt she now must brand me with inflamed to madness fly my rodolpho fly engage thy sister to aid my letter and this very evening secure an interview  i would not bear this rack another day not for my kingdom till then deepplungd in solitude and shades i will not see the hated face of man thought drives on thought on passions passions roll her smiles alone can calm my raging soul  act iii scene i sigismunda alone sitting in a disconsolate posture ah tyrant prince ah more than faithless tancred ungenerous and inhuman in thy falsehood had thou this morning when my hopeless heart submissive to my fortune and my duty had so much spirit left as to be willing to give thee back thy vows ah had thou then confessed the sad necessity thy state imposed upon thee and with gentle friendship since we must part at last our parting softened i should indeed  i should have been unhappy but not to this extreme  amidst my grief i had with pensive pleasure cherished still the sweet remembrance of thy former love thy image still had dwelt upon my soul and made our guiltless woes not undelightful but coolly thus  how could thou be so cruel  thus to revive my hopes to soothe my love and call forth all its tenderness then sink me in black despair  what unrelenting pride possessed thy breast that thou could bea unmoved to see me bent beneath a weight of shame pangs thou can never feel how could thou drag me in barbarous triumph at a rivals car how make me witness to a sight of horror that hand which but a few short hours ago so wantonly abused my simple faith before the attesting world given to another irrevocably given  there was a time when the least cloud that hung upon my brow perhaps imagined only touched thy pity then brightened often by the ready tear thy looks were softness all then the quick heart in every nerve alive forgot it self and for each other then we felt alone but now alas those tender days are fled now thou can see me wretched pierced with anguish with studied anguish of thy own creating nor wet thy hardened eye  hold let me think  i wrong thee sure thou can not be so base as meanly in my misery  triumph  what is it then  why should i search for pain  o it is as bad  it is fickleness of nature it is sickly love extinguished by ambition  is there kind heaven no constancy in man no steadfast truth no generous fixed affection that can bear up against a selfish world no there is none  even tancred is inconstant rising hence let me fly this scene  whatever i see these roofs these walls each object that surrounds me are tainted with his vows  but whither fly the groves are worse the soft retreat of belmont it is deepening glooms gay lawns and airy summits will wound my busy memory to torture and all its shades will whisper  faithless tancred  my father comes  how sunk in this disorder shall i sustain his presence  scene ii siffredi sigismunda siffredi sigismunda my dearest child i grieve to find thee thus a prey to tears i know the powerful cause from which they flow and therefore can excuse them but not their wilful obstinate continuance come rouse thee then call up thy drooping spirit come wake to reason from this dream of love and show the world thou art siffredis daughter  sigismunda alas i am unworthy of that name  siffredi thou art indeed to blame thou have too rashly engaged thy heart without a fathers sanction but this i can forgive the king has virtues that plead thy full excuse nor was i void of blame to trust thee to those dangerous virtues then dread not my reproaches though he blames thy tender father pities more than blames thee thou art my daughter still and if thy heart will now resume its pride assert itself and greatly rise superior to this trial i to my warmest confidence again will take thee and esteem thee more my daughter  sigismunda o you are gentler far than i deserve it is it ever was my darling pride to bend my soul to your supreme commands your wisest will and though by love betrayed  alas and punished too  i have transgressed the nicest bounds of duty yet i feel a sentiment of tenderness a source of filial nature springing in my breast that should it kill me shall control this passion and make me all submission and obedience to you my honored lord the best of fathers  siffredi come to my arms thou comfort of my age thou only joy and hope of these gray hairs come let me take thee to a parents heart there with the kindly aid of my advice even with the dew of these paternal tears revive and nourish this becoming spirit  then thou do promise me my sigismunda  thy father stoops to make it his request  thou will resign thy fond presumptuous hopes and henceforth never more indulge one thought that in the light of love regards the king  sigismunda hopes i have none  those by this fatal day are blasted all  but from my soul  banish while weeping memory there retains her seat thoughts which the purest bosom might have cherished once my delight now even in anguish charming is more alas my lord than i can promise  siffredi absence and time the softner of our passions will conquer this mean time i hope from thee a generous great effort that thou will now exert thy utmost force nor languish thus beneath the vain extravagance of love let not thy father blush to hear it said hs daughter was so weak ever to admit a thought so void of reason that a king should to his rank his honor and his glory the high important duties of a throne even to his throne itself madly prefer a wild  passion the fond child of youthful dreaming thought and vacant hours that he should quit his heavenappointed station desert his awful charge the care of all the toiling millions which this isle contains nay more shall plunge them into war and ruin and all to sooth a sick imagination a miserable weakness  must for thee to make thee blessed sicilia be unhappy the king himself lost to the nobler sense of manly praise become the piteous hero of some soft tale and rush on sure destruction can thou my daughter let the monstrous thought possess one moment thy perverted fancy rouse thee for shame and if a spark of virtue lies slumbering in thy soul bid it blaze forth nor sink unequal to the glorious lesson this day thy lover gave thee from his throne  sigismunda ah that was not from virtue  had my father that been his aim i yield to what you say it is powerful truth unanswerable reason then then with sad but duteous resignation i had submitted as became your daughter but in that moment when my humbled hopes were to my duty reconciled to raise them to yet a fonder height than ever they knew then rudely dash them down  there is the sting the blasting view is ever present to me  why did you drag me to a sight so cruel  siffredi it was a scene to fire thy emulation  sigismunda it was a scene of perfidy  but know i will do more than imitate the king  for he is false  i though sincerely pierced with the best truest passion ever touched a virgins breast here vow to heaven and you though from my heart i cannot from my hopes to cast this prince  what would you more my father  siffredi yes one thing more  thy father then is happy  though by the voice of innocence and virtue absolved we live not to our selves alone a rigorous world with peremptory sway subjects us all and even the noblest most this world from thee my honor and thy own demands one step a step by which convinced the king may see thy heart disdains to wear a chain which his has greatly thrown aside it is fitting too thy sexs pride commands thee to show the approving world thou can resign as well as he nor with inferior spirit a passion fatal to the public weal but above all thou must root our for ever from the kings breast the least remain of hope and henceforth make is mentioned love dishonor these things my daughter that must needs be done can but this way be done  by the safe refuge the sacred shelter of a husbands arms and there is one   sigismunda good heavens what means my lord  siffredi one of illustrious family high rank yet still of higher dignity and merit who can and will protect thee one to awe the king himself  nay hear me sigismunda  the noble osmond courts thee for his bride and has my plighted word  this day   sigismunda kneeling my father let me with trembling arms embrace thy knees o if you ever wished to see me happy if ever in infant years i gave you joy when as i prattling twined around your neck you snatched me to your bosom kissed my eyes and melting said you saw my mother there o save me from that worst severity of fate o outrage not my breaking heart to that degree  i cannot  it is impossible  so soon withdraw it give it to another  hear me my dearest father hear the voice of nature and humanity that plead as well as justice for me  not to choose without your wise direction may be duty but still my choice is free  that is a right which even the lowest slave can never lose and would you thus degrade me make me base for such it were to give my worthless person without my heart an injury to osmond the highest can be done  let me my lord  or i shall die shall by the sudden change be to distraction shocked  let me wear out my hapless days in solitude and silence far from the malice of a prying world at least  you cannot sure refuse me this  give me a little time  i will do all all i can do to please you  o your eye sheds a kind beam   siffredi my daughter you abuse the softness of my nature   sigismunda here my father till you relent here will i grow for ever  siffredi rise sigismunda  though you touch my heart nothing can shake the inexorable dictates of honor duty and determined reason then by the holy ties of filial love resolve i charge thee to receive earl osmond as suits the man who is thy fathers choice and worthy of thy hand  i go to bring him   sigismunda spare me my dearest father  siffredi aside i must rush from her soft grasp or nature will betray me o grant us heaven that fortitude of mind which listens to our duty not our passions  quit me my child  sigismunda you cannot oh my father you cannot leave me thus  siffredi come hither laura come to thy friend now show thy self a friend combat her weakness dissipate her tears cherish and reconcile her to her duty  scene iii sigismunda laura sigismunda o woe on woe distressed by love and duty o every way unhappy sigismunda  laura forgive me madam if i blame your grief how can you waste your tears on one so false unworthy of your tenderness to whom naught but contempt is due and indignation  sigismunda you know not half the horrors of my fate i might perhaps have learned to scorn his falsehood nay when the first sad burst of tears was past i might have roused my pride and scorned himself  but it is too much this greatest last misfortune  o whither shall i fly where hide me laura from the dire scene my father now prepares  laura what thus alarms you madam  sigismunda can it be can i  ah no  at once give to another my violated heart in one wild moment he brings earl osmond to receive my vows o dreadful change for tancred haughty osmond  laura now on my soul it is what an outragd heart like thine should wish  i should by heavens esteem it most exquisite revenge  sigismunda revenge on whom on my own heart already but too wretched  laura on him this tancred who has basely sold for the dull form of despicable grandeur his faith his love  at once a slave and tyrant  sigismunda o rail at me at my believing folly my vain illfounded hopes but spare him laura  laura who raised these hopes who triumphs over that weakness pardon the word  you greatly merit him better than him with all his giddy pomp you raised him by your smiles when he was nothing where is your womans pride that guardian spirit given us to dash the perfidy of man ye powers i cannot bear the thought with patience  yet recent from the most unsparing vows the tongue of love ever lavished from your hopes so vainly idly cruelly deluded before the public thus before your father by an irrevocable solemn deed with such inhuman scorn to throw you from him to give his faithless hand yet warm from thine with complicated meanness to constantia and to complete his crime when thy weak limbs could scarce support thee then of thee regardless to lead her off  sigismunda that was indeed a sight to poison love to turn it into rage and keen contempt  what means this stupid weakness that hangs upon me hence unworthy tears disgrace my cheek no more no more my heart for one so coolly false or meanly fickle  o it imports not which  dare to suggest the least excuse  yes traitor i will wring thy pride will turn thy triumph to confusion i will not pine away my days for thee sighing to brooks and groves while with vain pity you in a rivals arms lament my fate  no let me perish ere i tamely be that soft that patient gentle sigismunda who can console her with the wretched boast she was for thee unhappy  if i am i will be nobly so  sicilias daughters shall wondering see in me a great example of one who punished her illjudging heart who made it bow to what it most abhorred crushed it to misery for having thus so lightly listened to a worthless lover  laura at last it mounts the kindling pride of virtue trust me thy marriage will embitter his   sigismunda o may the furies light his nuptial torch be it accursed as mine for the fair peace the tender joys of hymeneal love may jealousy awaked and fell remorse pour all their fiercest venom through his breast  where the fates lead and blind revenge i follow  let me not think  by injured love i vow thou shall base prince perfidious and inhuman thou shall behold me in anothers arms in his thou hate osmonds  laura that will grind his heart with secret rage aye that will sting his soul to madness set him up a terror a spectacle of woe to saithless lovers  your cooler thought besides will of the change approve and think it happy noble osmond from the same stock with him derives his birth first of sicilian barons prudent brave of strictest honor and by all revered   sigismunda talk not of osmond but perfidious tancred rail at him rail invent new names of scorn assist me laura lend my rage fresh fuel support my staggering purpose which already begins to fail me  ah my vaunts how vain how have i lyd to my own heart  alas my tears return the mighty flood oerwhelms me ten thousand crouding images distract my tortured thought  and is it come to this our hopes our vows our often repeated wishes breathed from the fervent soul and full of heaven to make each other happy  come to this  laura if thy own peace and honor cannot keep thy resolution fixed yet sigismunda o think how deeply how beyond retreat thy father is engaged  sigismunda ah wretched weakness that thus enthrals my soul that chases thence each nobler thought the sense of every duty  and have i then no tears for thee my father can i forget thy cares from helpless years thy tenderness for me an eye still beamed with love a brow that never knew a frown nor a harsh word thy tongue shall i for these repay thy stooping venerable age with shame disquiet anguish and dishonor

apartment  siffredi pardon me my lord if by this sudden accident alarmed i leave you for a moment  scene v osmond alone let me think  what can this mean  is it to me aversion or is it as i feared she loves another ha  yes  perhaps the king the young count tancred they were bred up together  surely that that cannot be  has he not given his hand in the most solemn manner to constantia does not his crown depend upon the deed no  if they loved and this old statesman knew it he could not to a king prefer a subject his virtues i esteem  nay more i trust them  so far as virtue goes  but could he place his daughter on the throne of sicily  o it is a glorious bribe too much for man  what is it then  i care not what it be my honor now my dignity demands that my proposed alliance by her father and even her self accepted be not scorned i love her too  i never knew till now to what a pitch i loved her o she shot ten thousand charms into my inmost soul she looked so mild so amiably gentle she bowed her head she glowed with such confusion such loveliness of modesty she is in gracious mind in manners and in person the perfect model of all female beauty  she must be mine  she is  if yet her heart consents not to my happiness her duty joined to my tender cares will gain so much upon her generous nature  that will follow the man of sense who acts a prudent part not flattering steals but forms himself the heart  act iv scene i the garden belonging to siffredis house sigismunda laura sigismunda with a letter in her hand it is done  i am a slave  the fatal vow has passed my lips  methought in those sad moments the tombs around the saints the darkened altar and all the trembling shrines with horror shook but here is still new matter of distress o tancred cease to persecute me more o grudge me not some calmer state of woe some quiet gloom to shade my hopeless days where i may never hear of love and thee  has laura too conspired against my peace why did you take this letter  bear it back  giving her the letter i will not court new pain  laura madam rodolpho urged me so much nay even with tears conjured me but this once more to serve the unhappy king  for such he said he was  that though enraged equal with thee at his inhuman falsehood i could not to my brothers fervent prayers refuse this office  read it  his excuses will only more expose his falsehood  sigismunda no it suits not osmonds wife to read one line from that contagious hand  she knows too well  laura he paints him out distressed beyond expression even on the point of madness wild as winds and fighting seas he raves his passions mix with ceaseless rage all in each giddy moment he dies to see you and to clear his faith  sigismunda save me from that  that would be worse than all  laura i but report my brothers words who then began to talk of some dark imposition that had deceived us all when interrupted we heard your father and earl osmond near as summoned to constantias court they went  sigismunda ha imposition  well  if i am doomed to be over all my sex the wretch of love in vain i would resist  give me the letter  to know the worst is some relief  alas it was not thus with such dire palpitations that tancred once i used to read thy letters attempting to read the letter but gives it to laura ah fond remembrance blinds me  read it laura  laura reads deliver me sigismunda from that most exquisite misery which a faithful heart can suffer  to be thought base by her from whose esteem even virtue borrows new charms when i submitted to my cruel situation it was not falsehood you beheld but an excess of love rather than endanger that i for a while gave up my honor every moment till i see you stabs me with severer pangs than real guilt itself can feel let me then conjure you to meet me in the garden toward the close of the day when i will explain this mystery we have been most inhumanly abused and that by the means of the very paper which i gave you from the warmest sincerity of love to assure to you the heart and hand of  tancred    sigismunda there laura there the dreadful secret sprung that paper ah that paper it suggests a thousand horrid thoughts  i to my father gave it and he perhaps  i dare not cast a look that way  if yet indeed you love me o blast me not kind tancred with the truth o pitying keep me ignorant for ever what strange peculiar misery is mine reduced to wish the man i love were false why was i hurried to a step so rash repairless woe  i might have waited sure a few short hours  no duty that forbade  i owed thy love that justice till this day thy love an image of allperfect goodness a beam from heaven that glowed with every virtue and have i thrown this prize of life away the piteous wreck of one distracted moment ah the cold prudence of remorseless age ah parents traitors to your childrens bliss ah cursed ah blind revenge  on every hand i was betrayed  you laura too betrayed me   laura who who but he whatever he writes betrayed you or false or pusillanimous for once i will with you suppose that his agreement to the kings will was forged  though forged by whom your father scorns the crime  yet what avails it this if it clears his truth condemns his spirit a youthful king by love and honor fired patient to sit on his insulted throne and let an outrage of so high a nature unpunished pass uncheckd uncontradicted  o

the right but let us act with cool prudence and with manly temper as well as manly firmness true i own the indignities you suffer are so high as might even justify what now you threaten but if my lord we can prevent the woes the cruel horrors of intestine war yet hold untouched our liberties and laws o let us raised above the turbid sphere of little selfish passions nobly do it nor to our hot intemperate pride pour out a dire libation of sicilian blood it is godlike magnanimity to keep when most provoked our reason calm and clear and execute her will from a strong sense of what is right without the vulgar aid of heat and passion which though honest bear us often too far remember that my house protects my daughter still and ere i saw her thus ravished from us by the arm of power this

patience till he return to reason ye just powers when he has planted on our necks his foot and trod us into slaves when his vain pride is cloyed with our submission if at last he finds his arm too weak to shake the frame of wideestablishd order out of joint and overturn all justice then perchance he in a fit of sickly kind repentance may make a merit to return to reason no no my lord  there is a nobler way to teach the blind oppressive fury reason often has the luster of avenging steel unsealed her stupid eyes  the sword is reason  scene vi siffredi osmond rodolpho with guards rodolpho my

tempest as suits his generous nature yet in love abated naught most ardent in his purpose inexorably fixed whatever the risque to claim my daughter and dissolve this marriage  i have embarked upon a perilous sea a mighty treasure here the rapid youth the impetuous passions of a loverking check my bold course and there the jealous pride the impatient honor of a haughty lord of the first rank in interest and dependants near equal to the king forbid retreat my honor too the same unchanged conviction that these my measures were and still remain of absolute necessity to save the land from civil

sicilias cliffs you should be free  has some good angel turned his heart to justice  osmond it is not by the favor of count tancred that i am here as much i scorn his favor as i defy his tyranny and threats  our friend goffredo who commands the castle on my parole ere dawn to render back my person has permitted me this freedom know then the faithless outrage of today by him committed whom you call the king has roused constantias court our friends the friends of virtue justice and of public faith ripe for revolt are in high ferment all this this they say exceeds whatever deformed the miserable days we saw beneath william the bad this saps the solid base at once of government and private life this shameless imposition on the faith the majesty of senates this lewd insult this violation of the rights of men added to these his ignominious treatment of her the illustrious offspring of our kings sicilias hope and now our royal mistress you know my lord how grossly these infringe the late kings will which orders if count tancred make not constantia partner of his throne that he be quite excluded the succession and she to henry given king of the romans the potent

put in vigorous execution  siffredi you cannot doubt my lord of my concurrence who more than i have labored this great point it is my own plan and if i drop it now i should be justly branded with the shame of rash advice or despicable weakness but let us not precipitate the matter constantias friends are numerous and strong yet tancreds trust me are of equal force ever since the secret of his birth was known the people all are in a tumult hurled of boundless joy to hear there lives a prince of mighty guiscards line numbers besides of powerful barons who at heart had pined to see the reign of their renowned forefathers won by immortal deeds of matchless valor pass from the gallant normans to the suevi will with a kind of rage espouse his cause  it is so my lord  be not by passion blinded  it is surely so  o if our prating virtue dwells not in words alone  o let us join my generous osmond to avert these woes and yet sustain our tottering norman kingdom  osmond but how siffredi how  if by soft means we can maintain our rights and save our country may his unnatural blood first stain the sword who with unpitying fury first shall bare it  siffredi i have a thought  the glorious work be thine but it requires an awful flight of virtue above the passions of the vulgar breast and thence from thee i hope it noble osmond  suppose my daughter to her god devoted were placed within some convents sacred verge beneath the dread protection of the altar   osmond ere then by heavens i would devoutly shave my holy scalp turn whining monk myself and pray incessant for the tyrants safety  what how because an insolent invader a sacrilegious tyrant in contempt of all those noblest rights which to maintain is mans peculiar pride demands my wife that i shall thus betray the common cause of human kind and tamely yield her up even in the manner you propose  o then i were supremely vile degraded shamed the scorn of manhood and abhorred of honor  siffredi there is my lord an honor the calm child of reason of humanity and mercy superior far to this punctilious demon that singly minds it self and often embroils with proud barbarian niceties the world  osmond my lord my lord  i cannot brook your prudence  it holds a pulse unequal to my blood  unblemished honor is the flower of virtue the vivifying soul and he who slights it will leave the other dull and lifeless dross  siffredi no more  you are too warm  osmond you are too cool  siffredi too cool my lord i were indeed too cool not to resent this language and to tell thee  i wish earl osmond were as cool as i to his own selfish bliss  ay and as warm to that of others  but of this no more  my daughter is thy wife  i gave her to thee and will against all force maintain her thine but think not i will catch thy headlong passions whirled in a blaze of madness over the land or till the last extremity compel me risque the dire means of war  the king tomorrow will set you free and if by gentle means he does not yield my daughter to thy arms and wed constantia as the will requires why then expect me on the side of justice  let that suffice  osmond it does  forgive my heat my rankled mind by injuries inflamed may be too prompt to take and give offense  siffredi it is passed  your wrongs i own may well transport the wisest mind  but henceforth noble osmond do me more justice honor more my truth nor mark me with an eye of squint suspicion  these jars apart  you may repose your soul on my firm faith and unremitting friendship of that i sure have given exalted proof and the next sun we see shall prove it further  return my son and from your friend goffredo release your word there try by soft repose to calm your breast  osmond bid the vexed ocean sleep swept by the pinions of the raging north  but your frail age by care and toil exhausted demands the balm of allrepairing rest  siffredi soon as tomorrows dawn shall streak the skies i with my friends in solemn state assembled will to the palace and demand your freedom then by calm reason or by higher means the king shall quit his claim and in the face of sicily my daughter shall be yours farewell  osmond my lord goodnight  scene iii osmond alone after a long pause i like him not  yes  i have mighty matter of suspicion it is plain  i see it  lurking in his breast he has a foolish fondness for this king  my honor is not safe while here my wife remains  who knows but he this very night may bear her to some convent as he mentioned  the king too  though i smothered up my rage i marked it well  will set me free tomorrow why not tonight he has some dark design  by heavens he has  i am abused most grossly made the vile tool of this old statesmans schemes married to one  ay and he knew it  one who loves young tancred hence her swooning tears and all her soft distress when she disgraced me by basely giving her perfidious hand without her heart  hell and perdition this this is the perfidy this is the fell the keen envenomed exquisite disgrace which to a man of honor even exceeds the falsehood of the person  but i now will rouse me from the poor tame lethargy by my believing fondness cast upon me i will not wait his crawling timid motions perhaps to blind me meant which he tomorrow has promised to pursue no ere his eyes shall open on tomorrows orient beam i will convince him that earl osmond never was formed to be his dupe  i know full well the important weight and danger of the deed but to a man whom greater dangers press driven to the brink of infamy and horror rashness itself and utter desperation are the best prudence  i will bear her off this night and lodge her in a place of safety i have a trusty band that waits not far hence let me lose no time  one rapid moment should ardent form at once and execute a bold design  it is fixed  it is done  yes then when i have seized the prize of love and honor and with a friend secured her to the castle i will repair and claim goffredos promise to rise with all his

propose  tancred to claim the plighted vows which heaven has heard to vindicate the rights of holy love by faith and honor bound to which compared these empty forms which have ensnared thy hand are impious guile abuse and profanation  nay as a king whose high prerogative by this unlicensd marriage is affronted to bid the laws themselves pronounce it void  sigismunda honor my lord is much too proud to catch at every slender twig of nice distinctions these for the unfeeling vulgar may do well but those whose souls are by the nicer rule of virtuous delicacy nobly swayed stand at another bar
