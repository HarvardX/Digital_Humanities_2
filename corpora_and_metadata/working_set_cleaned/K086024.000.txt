the memoirs of the honorable sir john reresby bart and last governor of york containing several private and remarkable transactions from the restoration to the revolution inclusively  published from his original manuscript  london printed for samuel harding bookseller on the pavement in st martins lane       price   s   d bound  preface to insist on the value of works of this nature when they come from men of real knowledge and understanding were only to repeat what the wisest men have often said for us the reader we believe will be convinced that sir john was a person very equal to the task he undertook and having such opportunities of prying as it were into the hearts of the greatest ministers and princes of his time it had been unpardonable in him to have refrained from communicating the many important matters he so assuredly knew the reader will we hope find in him an impartiality rarely met with in writers who have been like him of a party for being a man of the strictest honor and nicest conscience he it seems thought it as unjust not to applaud an enemy for any good he had done as weak not to accuse a friend when through human frailty he happened to deserve it this and what goes before might be sufficient to bespeak the reader in his favor even though he had related no fact but such as had been an hundred times repeated before this appearance of his book but as he abounds with things new or what is the same with matters known to very few living and which will much assist us in forming a right idea of the times he lived in he must claim a greater share of attention but we will now leave sir john to plead his own cause and shall only add that we flatter our selves with the approbation of the public for our thus retrieving him from the recesses of privacy  memoirs of sir john reresby from the year      to the year      sir john having very minutely acquainted us with his birth education and travels which could neither affect the reader nor be admitted as part of what we promise to print of him we shall set out from the year      this year says he died oliver cromwell whitehall i can only say that his figure did not come up to his character he was indeed a likely person but not handsome nor had he a very bold look with him he was plain in his apparel and rather negligent than not tears he had at will and was doubtless the deepest dissembler on earth  the duke of buckingham who had attended thomas lord fairfax formerly the parliaments general and unto whom had been granted the greatest part of the said dukes estate this duke was the finest gentleman both for person and wit i think i ever saw but he knew not how to be long serious or mindful of business and had behaved with some insolence to the king which was the cause of their separation it was now that i first became acquainted with him and he from the very first moment expressed a kindness for me  it was now easy to perceive that a way was paved to facilitate the kings return but still the rump kept up some face of state and i remember to have been present at a dinner given by the city of london to lambert and other officers of the army by far more costly and splendid than any i ever saw given afterward to his majesty so much is awe more prevalent than love  continuing but in an indifferent state of health i partly for that reason and partly for others returned to paris where i had no sooner put my self into some equipage but i endeavored to be known at our queen mothers court which she then kept at the palais royal her majesty had none of her children with her but the princess henrietta maria and few of the english making their court there i was the better received as i spoke the language of the country and danced pretty well the young princess then about fifteen years of age behaved toward me with all the civil freedom that might be she made me dance with her played on the harpsicord to me in her highnesss chamber suffered me to wait on her as she walked in the garden and sometimes to toss her in a swing between two trees and in fine to be present at all her innocent diversions  the queen commanded me to attend as often as i conveniently could she had a great affection for england notwithstanding the severity of usage she and hers had met with there with the great men and ladies of france she discoursed much in praise of the people and country of their courage their generosity their good nature and would excuse all the late misfortunes as brought about by some desperate enthusiasts rather than proceeding from the genius and temper of the nation to give a little instance of her inclination for the english i happened to carry an english gentleman with me one day to court and he to be very fine had got him a garniture of rich ribbon to his suit in which was a mixture of red and yellow which the queen observing called to me and bad me advise my friend to mend his fancy a little as to his ribbons the two colors he had joined being ridiculous in france and might give the french occasion to laugh at him  i had three cousins then in an english convent at paris one of them an ancient lady and since abbess of the house hither the queen was wont often to retire for some days and the lady would tell me that lord jermyn since st albans had the queen greatly in awe of him and indeed it was obvious that he had great interest with her concerns but that he was married to her or had children by her as some have reported i did not then believe tho  the court of france was very splendid this winter a grand mask was danced at the louvre where the king and princess henriette of england danced to admiration but there was now a greater resort to the palace than the french court the good humor and wit of our queen mother and the beauty of the princess her daughter being more inviting than any thing that appeared in the french queen who was a spaniard  the queen mother received the news of his majestys happy restoration with all imaginable demonstrations of joy and among other things gave a noble ball at her court to which every body of the greatest quality was invited and to which all the english gentlemen then at paris had admittance having been ill some time before i would have been excused from dancing but the queen commanded me to take out the cardinals niece i obeyed  i stayed at paris till august and received more honors from the queen and the princess her daughter than i deserved or could acknowledge but by the most constant duty and attendance in my power  england but before my departure i waited on the queen for her commands she told me she would write by me and ordered me to attend next morning for her letter having received it and taken my leave i desired to know if it required haste her majesty said no for that it contained but little besides a particular recommendation of me to her son the king  at london i met my mother and most of my relations who were come up as from all parts of england they did to see the king and was presented by the duke of ormond then but marquess to his majesty in the privy chamber at whitehall and delivering him the queens letter he asked me several questions both concerning her and my voyage  the court at whitehall soon became very magnificent the duke of york having his court apart and the duke of gloucester his the kingdom was now very rich and men were generally satisfied with the kings return though some malcontents of several sorts there were and how should it be otherwise but the king did not much adhere to business all was calm and easy he had a parliament ready to yield to any thing that was reasonable as the acts they made sufficiently declare and the earl of clarendon then chancellor was at the helm the king who was at an age and vigor for it pursued his pleasures and if love prevailed with him more than any other passion he had this for excuse besides that his complexion was of an amorous sort the women seemed to be the aggressors and i have since heard the king say that they would sometimes offer themselves to his embraces nor were the two dukes his brothers more averse to the sex than his majesty  bohemia came over from the hague as did also his sister the princess of orange but they both dyed soon after their arrival as did also the duke of gloucester  the queen mother often asked me if the king had done any thing for me and what it was i had fixed my mind on that she might speak a word for me but in truth i did not at that time pursue my own advantage as i might have done and went to court rather to converse and look about me than to solicit any favor i chiefly relied on the queens kindness to me and the influence she had over the king but all the pleasing superstructure fell to the ground the queen left england soon after the death of her children taking the princess henrietta away with her to paris and i was disappointed  london by one venner which in its very rise was defeated by a party of the guards but running out of town they rallied again in canewood near highgatehaving a mind therefore to see a little action i mounted one of my coachhorses and mounted my man upon the other and joined sir thomas sands who commanded the party of the guards that went in pursuit of the incendiaries having searched the wood till midnight we came to a little house where the people told us they had been desiring some victuals but a little while before and that they could not be far off accordingly about an hour after this we found some of them in the thickest part of the wood they discharged their pieces at us but the moon setting they got from us and hurried back again to london where they met with the fate every canewood  it was this summer that the duke of york first took any particular notice of me i happened to be in discourse with the french ambassador and some other gentlemen of his nation in the presence at whitehall and the duke joined us he being a great lover of the french tongue and kind to those who spoke it the next night he talked with me a long while as he was at supper with the king  now it was that the king went to receive portugal at portsmouth castlemain since duchess of cleveland the finest woman of her age it is well known that the lord chancellor had the blame of this unfruitful match and that the queen was said to have had a constant fluor upon her which rendered her incapable of conception  dutch to action  london and swept away    0  persons it was usual for people to drop down in the streets as they went about their business and a story is reported for a certain truth that a bagpiper being excessively overcome with liquor fell down in the street and there lay asleep in this condition he was taken up and thrown into a cart betimes the next morning and carried away with some dead bodies mean while he awoke from his sleep it being now about daybreak and rising up began to play a tune which so surpised the fellows that drove the cart who could see nothing distinctly that in a fright they betook them to their heels and would have it that they had taken up the devil in the disguise of adead man  but to resume other things i married and was thereby prevented from being an eyewitness of the dutch war and so i shall only say that his highness obtained a glorious victory over that republic  his royal highness the duke and his duchess came down to york where it was sydney the handsomest youth of his time and of the dukes bedchamber was greatly in love with the duchess and indeed he might well be excused for the duchess daughter to chancellor hide was a very handsome personage and a woman of fine wit the duchess on her part seemed kind to him but very innocently but he had the misfortune to be banished the court afterward for another reason as was reported  oxford to put the king in mind of a former promise to make me high sheriff of the county of york the year next ensuing but hearing that sir francis cob who had been at some extraordinary charge in receiving and attending the court at york obtained a grant to continue in that office for another year at his highnesss intercession i waited on the duke acquainted him with my claim and begged his assistance he told me he wished he had known my claim in time that he should have been ready to serve me and that i had nevertheless his leave to solicit his majestys promise i thanked him but said i could not appear in any degree of opposition to his highnesss interest and pleasure and would therefore defer my pretensions to a better opportunity this he took very kindly went with me to the king and presented me to him for the next year his majesty gave me his hand to kiss and his word once more that i should be sheriff as i had desired  dutch by prince rupert and the duke of albemarle and a sad and dismal fire laid the vast and noble city of london in ashes but these being events that have been of late largely described already i shall only observe of the latter that the dreadful destruction was not more extraordinary than the speed regularity and cost wherewith it was retrieved and a new london far exceeding the old erected  london to put the king and duke in mind of their promise that i should be high sheriff for the county of york for the year next ensuing and no sooner did i appear before the duke than he said to me i remembered you though you was not here and your business is done for you and to say the truth there was no prince at that time observed to be more punctual to his word i found what the duke told me to be perfectly true the king did graciously confirm what he had said and named me sheriff for the county of york though i was not of the three presented to him by the judges  the duke of buckingham had been some the respect i had for the duke but the judges coming down to the assizes advised me by all means to proclaim it which i did and it for ever after lessened me in the esteem of that lord  my lord southampton lord high treasurer of england being lately dead the administration of that great office was transacted by four commissioners the duke of albemarle lord ashley cooper afterward earl of shaftsbury sir william coventry secretary to the duke of york and sir john duncomb it was now that the parliament fell upon the great earl of clarendon who having surrendered the seals a few months afterward as much as possible to avoid the heat of his enemies retired privately into france his greatest enemy in the house of lords was the duke of buckingham in the house of commons sir thomas osborne since earl of danby by this step and by the help of his grace the duke of buckingham who was now absolute favorite it was that sir thomas more especially rose to his height of dignity  the duke of buckingham now acted as prime minister the king consulted him chiefly in all concerns of moment the foreign ministers were to apply to him before they could be admitted to an audience but he was such a foe to business such a friend to pleasure and so apt to turn the day into night and the night into day that he could neither attend regularly on the king nor dispatch business as it ought to be with those who had any thing to negociate with him so his ministry proved of no long duration  this spring i carried my family up to france with spain with denmark and the states general ambassadors extraordinary were now sent and received with the greatest pomp and splendour  tuscany came to london with a retinue and equipage suitable italy had to afford i dined with him twice he was very kind to me as he was to all those who had traveled into italy and spoke the language and this spring the prince of denmark was in london the same who some years afterward married the princess anne of england  paris she was a great princess and my very good mistress  orleans the kings sister came over to dover where she was met by the king the duke of york and the whole court here it was that she confirmed his highness the duke in the popish superstition of which he had as yet been but barely suspected and it is said to have been his grand argument for such his adherence to those tenets that his mother had upon her last blessing commanded him to be firm and steadfast thereto before this it was thought he was rather a friend to the presbyterians for not long before a nonconformist minister being prosecuted at pomfret for preaching in a conventicle it was reported that his highness and the duke of buckingham then principal minister of state had written in his favor to the justices but the duke as i was one day attending on him in st jamess park called me to him and discoursing over the thing to me declared what was reported to be a mistake that he had not concerned himself at all with it though he was so much a friend to that sort of people that he could wish the law had not been put in execution against him or to that effect and that absolutely he did not write at the same time he told me to represent him upon occasion as no enemy to such hereupon i acquainted his highness that there was a kinsman of mine one mr vincent in town who was a leading man of that party his highness ordered me to bring him to court which i did and the duke took him aside and talked with him a great while it was generally believed that the duke in this acted the politician suitable to the time for it was now rumoured about the king would be divorced from his queen which by thus courting all parties he proposed to prevent  but however this was our royal family lost another of its number for the duke of orleans had for some time before been jealous of his wife and if all that is said be true not without good ground the count de guiche it seems had been a favorite with her and now she is said to have fallen in love with the duke of monmouth while she was at dover in short things were so represented to the duke her husband that she died very suddenly after her return to paris by poison as the report went  orange came to london to pay a visit to the king the parliament being now met pursuant to prorogation it happened that sir john coventry in a speech he made reflected on the kings wenching which being reported to the duke of monmouth he ordered sir thomas sands an officer of the guards and three or four more to waylay him as he went late home to his lodging which they accordingly did and taking him out of his coach slit his nose but complaint thereof being made to the house it caused such a heat that thence proceeded the act against malicious maiming and wounding  the prince of orange remaining in england and making his addresses to the lady mary eldest daughter to the duke the king entertained him with great splendour as well on that account as because of his relation to him and great personal merit one night at a supper given by the duke of buckingham the king made him drink very hard the prince was naturally averse to it but being once entered was more frolic and gay than the rest of the company and now the mind took him to break the windows of the chambers belonging to the maids of honor and he had got into their apartments had they not been timely rescued his mistress i suppose did not like him the worse for such a notable indication of his vigor  anne duchess of york  london had in a great measure recovered herself out of her ashes and was so far rebuilt this year that the king was on the lord mayors day invited to a dinner which he accepted  the king about this time issued out a proclamation for the indulgence of tender consciences which caused great uneasiness not only in the houses of parliament where it was afterward reversed but throughout the whole kingdom and was the most violent blow that had been given to the church of england from the day of the restoration all sectaries now publicly repaired to their meetings and conventicles nor could all the laws afterward and the most rigorous execution of them ever suppress  french joined us against the dutch but in the end betrayed us in the engagement upon the    th of may the french stood off and left us and the dutch to make the best we could of it whereas if they had assisted his highness of york who then commanded in chief as high admiral we had doubtless obtained a signal victory but as the case was we had so much the better that after a fight of eight hours the dutch made sail from us in this engagement perished edward montague earl of sandwich vice admiral  it was this year that my lord hallifax first came into business and was sworn of the privy council he was soon after joined buckingham and lord arlington as ambassadors to the states but to no purpose the war continued  burlington for the security of the colliers and others trading to the northward and i immediately applied to the duke entreating him to speak to the king that i might have the command of the intended place who accordingly did but whilst the thing was in agitation his highness refused to take the oaths tendered to him as lord high admiral thereby declaring himself a roman catholic and resigning all his employments so that nothing more was done in my business for that time  and now the king having borrowed most of the ready money in the nation of the goldsmiths at that time called bankers locked up the exchequer to the bankruptcy of the most considerable of them and the ruin of an infinite people whose money they had borrowed at interest and with this calamity we conclude this year  thomas osborne rose to the great office of high treasurer of england my lord clifford resigning his staff and confessing himself a papist the duke of buckingham was chiefly instrumental in bringing this about for sir thomas by a bargain he made between lord clifford and him namely that sir thomas should officiate and give him half the salary and afterward prevailing on the king to confer the staff on sir thomas then created lord viscount dunblain though afterward earl of danby and had a patent passing for marquess just as he fell into disgrace  the war with the dutch still continued prince rupert being admiral for us and the count destrees for the french two victories we now obtained over them but they were lessened by the loss of that great seaman sir edward spraig  the parliament of these days had from the beginning which was soon after the restoration been perfectly well inclined to the king they had given him a very great revenue upon tonnage and poundage as also by an excise upon several sorts of liquors hearthmoney not to mention temporary taxes the whole amounting to above three times more than had been enjoyed by any king of england before the country groaned under this pressure and began to be dissatisfied which having an influence on some gentlemen of both houses gave birth to two parties the one for the country the other for the court the former pretended in an impartial manner to espouse the cause of the people in their liberties and properties and whatever is dear to englishmen to assert the religion and government by law established the latter pretended to the same but thought the king was to have a competent income and be invested with a due power for the exercise of his regal office without having too great a dependence on the people a cause which had been of such pernicious effects to his royal father hence it was that gentlemen bestirred themselves more than usual to be elected into a seat in parliament so that great was the competition between the candidates and at great expenses they were even from one or two hundred to two thousand pounds but the concerns of the public were not what alone actuated all men some wanted to be in the house to be screened from their debts this parliament having sat a long while and some had obtained great emoluments from the court to stand up for that interest so that it is no wonder i had no less than five competitors when i offered myself for audborough and not to drop this matter here i must observe that mr benson was the most formidable of the five a man of no birth but who from a clerk to a country attorney had raised himself to be clerk of the peace at the old bailey clerk of assize of the northern circuit as also to an estate of two thousand five hundred pounds though not without some reflections on his way of getting it the election was irregularly carried on in favor of this gentleman and in the january following i moved the house to determine the merit of the return but before a hearing came on a prorogation intervened so that i had the charge of bringing up witnesses to no manner of purpose  toward the latter end of this year the duke declared his marriage with mary daughter to the duke of modena not long before arrived with the duchess her mother the nation was much grieved at this match the lady being a papist of the strictest class and the whole affair managed by the french interest  buckingham was now again in disgrace for which he was indebted to the duchess of portsmouth a french lady and now the most absolute of all the kings mistresses a very fine woman she was but most think she was sent on purpose to ensnare the king who most readily ran into toils of that sort his grace in vain made use of the mediation of the lord treasurer and to say the truth his lordship was not altogether so zealous for his grace as he ought to have been especially if we consider that it was to him he owed the white staff he bore in short the duke was not the only person that accused him of ingratitude  the king was at this time particularly shrewsbury as man and wife he being a married man and for having killed my lord shrewsbury after he had debauched his wife  the king prorogued the parliament to april next ensuing  the time of the meeting of parliament now drawing on i repaired to london and petitioned the committee of privileges and elections and after all endeavors to the contrary i was voted the sitting member and conducted into the house by lord russell and lord cavendish  being thus received into the house i found the two parties in great extremes against each other the courtside was very pressing and urgent for money for the kings present occasions the country party thought of nothing less except some laws were enacted for the better security of the protestant religion and the grand point of property but the two were so equal that nothing more than words passed between them mere words without any effect for neither dared stand the chance shirley prefers a petition to the house of lords against sir john fag a member of the lower house to appear and answer in a cause he had brought before the lords and a summons was sent to sir john accordingly which the commons considering as a breach of privilege great heats arose among them and high expressions being upon this occasion mutually vented against each other by both houses the king thought fit to adjourn their time of sitting for the present  benson and another mr long petitioned against me they would have had a short day but it was my business to get as long a one as i could and i accordingly did so in short the business of the house was of such consequence that the prorogation came on before our cause could be heard i took a particular account of what was transacted this session the most extraordinary particulars of which were summarily these  the king had in his speech acquainted us that he was four millions in debt exclusive of what he owed to the godsmiths or bankers a vast sum more for which he paid neither principal nor interest to the ruin of many families it being upon this put to the vote whether money should be given or not it was carried in the negative by four voices and that when near four hundred members were in the house but it appearing that both the dutch and french exceeded us in the proportion and number of their shipping a sum of three hundred thousand pounds was voted to the king for the building of twenty ships namely one of the first rate five of the second and fourteen of the third  several ways were debated for the raising of this sum as upon land upon the jews by way of poll or upon french commodities and lastly upon our own consumption and upon merchandise at length it was to be levied upon land and paid in eighteen months to be lodged apart in the exchequer and appropriated to that particular use with very severe penalties upon the officers that should apply it to any other but the sum itself the time it was to be raised in and other circumstances were by no means grateful to the court it was farther voted that the customs having been formerly given to the king for the maintenance of the fleet a clause to that effect and purpose should be inserted in this bill or a new one prepared to confirm it  the state of the fleet was now given in whereby it appeared that we had no more than eight first rates nine second rates and forty three third rates while the french exceeded us in the number of these rates by six and twenty and the dutch by fourteen  it was moreover voted that the atheism debauchery and impiety of the present age be inserted as grievances to be redressed and it being violently suspected that some members of the house did receive gratuities from the court to vote on that side it was put that a committee should be appointed to form a kind of oath or test to discover what sums of money and offices had been given to parliament men to gain their interest  the french trade also was complained of as being thirteen hundred thousand pounds an overbalance for ours and upon the matter it appeared that every thousand pounds a year had since the restoration paid a hundred pounds in taxes to the crown  it was also voted a grievance that justices of the peace should be summoned to appear before the council to account for what they did in their judicial capacity  luzance took up some time in the house this luzance was a french jesuit but becoming a convert to the church of england inveighed against the fallacies of the church of rome in a sermon he preached in the french church in the savoy this alarmed the papists and particularly one doctor burnet a jesuit and confessor to the duchess of york who finding him alone in his chamber and posting three men at the door threatened to murder him if he did not make satisfaction for the injury eat his words and speedily return to france the man in this desperate dilemma promised faithfully whatever was required of him till he got his liberty when presently going to doctor breval a converted jesuit as well as himself he told him the whole story breval the next day acquainted me with it and i communicated it to the house the commons took fire at this and strait appointed a committee to examine into the matter and ordered me to produce luzance the next day he appeared accordingly and averred the thing for a truth this was the first time i presumed to speak in that great assembly or in any committee but the next day i was obliged to do it several times in what concerned this violent business  upon the report made from the committee to the house my lord cavendish called me up to give an account of some other things i had had from luzance one was that two french protestants being merchants of great substance and credit had been threatened by certain papists that if they were not less severe upon the romanists they should ere long see the protestant blood flow in london streets a committee was appointed to enquire into the truth of this matter and luzance being summoned gave evidence to the very self same effect and gave it under his own hand the parties he had his information from being sent for appeared also and declared such threats to have been used toward them by some french papists but to what cause it was owing is uncertain they gave in only such names as were of persons either absent or of no estimation so that little came of this business but these and other such informations concerning the height and insolence of the papists did so exasperate the house that many motions were made to humble them some were for a speedy confinement of them to the country others for banishment and some again for disarming them and the like  in a short time after the matter of doctor shirleys petition to the lords against sir john fag was again renewed though it had broke up the parliament the last time there were those who thought the king had consented to it disliking the warm proceedings of both houses while others were of opinion that the lords of the country interest had persuaded the doctor thereto with a view thereby to kindle such a flame between the two houses that the king should be obliged either to prorogue adjourn or dissolve them the said lords apprehending that if this parliament should sit much longer the majority might be gained over by money and places so as to become quite obsequious to the court and this my lord hallifax then in the interest of lord shaftsbury his uncle who was upon ill terms with the court being no longer lord chancellor told me was his opinion  but whatever the cause was the effect was such that the commons refusing to let their member plead at the bar of the lords during a time of privilege it was resolved that the lords by receiving an appeal from any court either of law or equity against a member of the lower house during a session of parliament were thereby infringers of the privileges of the commons of england and that such lawyers as should attend as counsel to plead in any such cause at the lords bar should be deemed as betrayers of the rights of the commons of england and that the said vote be affixed to the door of the house of commons westminster hall and the inns of court which was accordingly done and the same day it was voted by the lords that the same was illegal and unparliamentary and tended to the dissolution of the government and upon the whole that they would not recede from their right of judicature by appeals from the courts of equity  it was then put to the question if the king should not be petitioned to dissolve this parliament and it was carried in the negative by no more than two votes  this misunderstanding between the houses was very dissatisfactory to the king the lords who had voted for the dissolution of this parliament entered their protest in the journal of their house together with their reasons sor so doing so that things being at this pass the only expedient left was to dismiss the parliament which the king did by prorogation to the  0th of february next  before i left london i at the interposition of my lord ogle went with his lordship to see the duke of buckingham being well assured that i should be kindly received  i had a fine black of about sixteen years barbados this black lived with me some years and died about this time of an imposthume in his head six weeks after he was buried i london it was credibly reported i had caused him to be gelt and that the operation had killed him i laughed at it at first conscious it was a falsehood and a ridiculous story till being further informed that it came from the duke of norfolk and his family with whom i had had some differences at law and that he had waited upon the king to beg my estate if it became a forfeiture by this felony i thought it convenient to send for the coroner to view the body with a jury before it was too far decayed that a rottenness of the part might not be imputed to incision the coroner accordingly summons a jury and does his office but when they came to uncover the breast it was so putrified they would go no further so that upon the examination of eleven witnesses some that laid him out and some that saw him naked several because of his color having a curiosity to see him after he was dead they gave their verdict that he died ex visitatione dei by the hand of god  this however was not thought sufficient for within a few days after there came one bright a lawyer one chapel an attorney both concerned in the dukes affairs and one buck a surgeon of sheffield whom i had caused to be prosecuted not long before for having two wives together with some others with my lord chief justices warrant directed to the coroner to take up the body which the coroner refused to obey saying he had done his office already these ambassadors however took up the body and buck under pretense of viewing the part the better would have taken it up with a penknise but it was not suffered lest by that instrument he should give the wound he sought for but what was not only a mercy but a miracle also the part proved to be perfectly sound and entire though the body had been so long under ground and the rest of it was much putrified and decayed so that shame of face and confusion came pretty plentifully upon the actors in this extraordinary scene  a black and most ridiculous piece of malice this for had their suggestion been proved a fact all their art could never have so fixed it as to have endangered either my person or estate my lord chief justice rainsford acted irregularly and illegally in this business his information not being given in to him upon oath and indeed he afterward confessed he was misled into it and that the dukes solicitor was most pressing and urgent with him to grant the warrant the duke of york told my brother he wondered such a stir was made about a report which must certainly be a flat falsehood and lord ogle acquainted me as did also my lord treasurer himself afterward that he meaning the treasurer had taken great pains to prevent the begging of my estate and i believed it to be true but shrewdly doubt it was with design had it proved a forfeiture to have secured it for himself i was told as much afterward i endeavored however to reach the bottom of his plot and to procure myself some reparation as may be observed hereafter  christmas in the country i no sooner returned to london than my lord treasurer sent to speak with me i waited on him therefore and found him very open in his discourse upon several subjects but for the most part lamenting that his countrymen would not allow him an opportunity to be of service to them with the king and making many protestations that the jealousies of those who called themselves of the country party were entirely groundless and without foundation that to his certain knowledge the king meant no other than to preserve the religion and government by law established and upon the whole wished that neither himself or his posterity might prosper if he did not speak what he really believed that if the government was in any danger it was most from those who pretended such a mighty zeal for it but who under that pretense were endeavoring to create such discontents between the king and the nation as might produce confusion in the end and entreated me to be careful how i embarked myself with that sort of people my reply was that i hoped i was not one to be wilfully misled that i should have no rule to go by in that house but my reason and conscience and that so i could be of no particular faction or party that as much as i yet understood of the duty of a member of the house of commons at this time suggested to me a moderation between the two extremes and to have an equal regard for the prerogative of the king and the liberty of the subject  true it is till now that the treasurer used such solemn asseverations with regard to the kings good intention and pretty clearly convinced me that some of the chiefs of the country party had most at heart their own private interest whatever they asserted in favor and defense of the public i had great notions of the truth and sincerity of the country party  treasurer took it so kindly that i sided not with those who did all they could to weaken and distress the crown that he would needs carry me to kiss his majestys hand which i had not yet done since i came to town and presented me in the lobby of the house of lords next to the princes lodgings no body being present but his majesty his lordship and my self he said much more of me to the king than i deserved but lastly that as my family had been always loyal he knew i was perfectly inclined to tread in their footsteps and that the best way to confirm me in such my disposition would be to let me understand how little of truth there was in the pretenses set on foot to deceive gentlemen and withdraw them from their duty the king said he had known me long and hoped i knew him so well as to give no ear to such reports of him i know says he it is said i aim at the subversion of the government and religion that i intend to lay aside parliaments and to raise money another way but every man nay those who insist the most thereon knows the thing in all its circumstance to be false there is not a subject that lives under me whose safety and welfare i desire less than my own and i should be as sorry to invade his liberty and property as that another should invade mine those members continued the king who boast this mighty friendship for the public are of two sorts either those who would actually and irretrievably subvert the government and reduce it to a commonwealth once more or else those who seem only to join with the former and talk loud against the court purely in hopes to have their mouths stopped with places or preferments and to say the truth the treasurer had named some of the chiefs to me who had desired so and so of the king and upon such conditions promised to come over  i made answer to the king that indeed the pretenses were many and to some i believed plausible that were raised in opposition to what others understood to be for his majestys interest but that they had gained but little on me who had had the honor of being so long known to his majesty and had been so lately confirmed in my belief by assurances from my lord treasurer that to the best of my knowledge i should never do any thing that became not a true and faithful subject or should be inconsistent with the prosperity of his majestys royal person and government the king said he was very well pleased that he had seen me commanded me to wait on him sometimes and told me i should have access to him when and wherever i desired it  the condescension of the king in giving this satisfaction to so mean a person convinced me very much of the truth of what he said as did also his natural temper and constitution for he was not an active busy or ambitious prince but perfectly a friend to ease and fond of pleasure he seemed to be chiefly desirous of peace and quiet for his own time  at this time a great dispute arising between the lord marshal of england lord henry howard though commonly called duke of norfolk and his younger brothers they not only petitioned the house of commons in behalf of themselves but also of their eldest brother the duke whom the said lord marshal kept up at padua as a lunatic though perfectly in possession of his senses praying that the house would be pleased to move the king to oblige the marshal to send for him into england upon this a debate arose in the house every one delivering his mind according to his belief or prejudices till at length the gentlemen of the house who had been at padua were desired to give their opinions as to the state and condition of the duke upon this occasion i declared that at the time i saw him he labored under all the symptoms of lunacy and distraction this being carried to the lord marshal who was very conscious i was indebted to him for no obligation he sent a gentleman to me the next day to thank me for my generosity to a person who had not seemed to have been so much my friend as he ought to have been and touching obliquely on the affair of the blackamoor he said he intended to wait on me to give me some farther satisfaction as to that  my answer to this message was that i was surprised at the compliment from a gentleman to whom i intended none what i had said having been with a due regard to truth that however i was not sorry i had happened to oblige his lordship by it and that since he had denied all concern in the iniquitous affair of my dead servant i would prevent his lordship and wait on him my self as i did two or three days afterward he received me with all the civility and kindness imaginable and wished that neither himself or prosperity might prosper if he was any way aiding or assisting in the plot laid against me i told his lordship that i could not but add faith to his words but that if he was not i was well assured his servants were and therefore desired he would give me leave to use my best endeavors to find it out with all his heart he said he did not only consent to it but would moreover assist me in the inquiry and so with all possible demonstrations of friendship we parted  i very often visited and dined with my lord treasurer and often waited on the king who when he saw me would ask me how things went forward and particularly i this day entertained him a long yorks bedchamber with what had then been transacting in the house of commons  this session had gone on smoothly and sedately enough in both houses my lord treasurer having so ordered it that the kings party increased rather than the other but it was much feared that some votes were obtained more by purchase than affection and with this we close up the year  the commons voted a second address to the king that he would be pleased to flanders in the hands of the king of spain but with this restriction that his majesty should not be obliged to return any answer to the house upon the subject of the said address though a number who would have drawn him into inconveniences would have had him urged to declare his intentions therein by which he must have either disobliged the nation on the one hand or on the other have declared war with france before he was prepared to prosecute it  fair of my election which being to be tried very soon his majefty gave orders to his servants that were of the house to attend the committee and assist me with their best services when it came on the same day the duke of albemark came down to engage his friends to be for me nor did the duke of york forget to concern himself very earnestly in my behalf  the same day being alone with the lord treasurer in his coach as he was going to westminster i told him that some of the discontented had resolved to hasten the moneybill as fast as might be that so the house might rise before easter and the public bills that were preparing be left unpassed hoping thereby to incense the nation and bring about cause of complaint against the king as if he called the parliament together for nothing but to get money from them his lordship answered that the king well aware of the design would prevent it by a message that day to be delivered to the house by mr secretary coventry to this effect that if ought remained undone which the house judged necessary to be done for the good of the nation the king would allow them a sufficient time after eafter and that when they were ready his majesty would pass their bills a message that was accordingly delivered  my lord treasurer sent for me among others desiring us to assist what we could toward the reconciliation of a difference likely to take place between the two houses about framing the bill for the six hundred thousand pounds to be given to the king which might endanger the loss of the same for the commons had made a clause therein injoining the officers of the exchequer to give them an account of the disbursment and distribution of the said sum while the lords had asserted they should be accountable to both houses this the commons would not suffer alleging the lords could neither add to nor take away from a moneybill for that as it was peculiar to them only to give money it was to them only that account was to be given how it was applied the lords to this replied that to deny them the power of calling the officers of the exchequer to a reckoning was to abridge them of the privilege of judicature they undoubtedly had as the supreme court and by way of precedent observed that when the convention gave money for the disbanding of the army an account of the same was ordered to be laid before their house as well as the other they both adhered tenaciously to their point till the king at length prevailed with the lords to erase their clause and so the commons got the better of the day  it was not long before this that the king of france having obtained a victory over the prince of orange did in his return by calais send over the duke of crequy and the archbishop of rheims to pay a compliment to our king who returned it by my lord sunderland this gave just cause to think there would be no war between the two kings contrary to what the parliament had so earnestly advised i saw a copy of the letter these ambassadors brought with them beginning with this style or title tres haut tres excellent and tres puissent prince tres cher tres aim bon friar cousin and allie and in truth our kings neutrality deserved all this from france and much more  particular believing the report to be a malicious lie but that he was of opinion with me that now was a fit time to ask his majesty for something by way of reparation and that he would assist me therein his lordship was upon this occasion so open with me as to tell me that though the king denied scarce any thing to the duke his brother he certainly did not love him at his heart  he told me also that the king had no mind to fall out with france and that if the parliament would effectually engage him in that war their way would be to furnish him with sums of money to prepare for it and that no less than six hundred thousand pounds would be absolutely necessary for that purpose that if the king accepted of this he would be obliged to carry on the war but that if the parliament would not trust him he was in the right not to embark himself and might justly argue how can i depend on my parliament to furnish me with regular and equal supplies to carry on a war which they will not so much as enable me to prepare for but i easily saw through this i plainly perceived it was all artifice to get the fingering of money  he moreover said that the king could not in honor join the confederates against france that in all the treaties the king of england had been mentioned as principal in the war that in the beginning he did actually join with france and that for him now to turn his arms against that crown would look neither just nor honorable in the eye of the world this his lordship told me was the kings own way of arguing whenever war happened to be the subject of their discourse together but that his answer to his majesty was that he needed not be so regardful of that transaction the french king having played him the very same trick when chancellor hyde was chief minister to this he replied that the french king had a pique against the lord chancellor to which the treasurer subjoined that whatever was the cause the thing was as he had said  he was so free also as to tell me still further that the duke was the grand promoter of the french interest and that he now made his court to the sectaries and fanatics only to give strength and vigor to the popish interest that his highness was so very a bigot that though the archbishop of rheims made no scruple to go into our churches and even kneel down during the time of divine service the duke at the same time could not be prevailed on so much as to step within the doors he observed that the duke was particularly unhappy in his servants a senseless pack but that indeed his confessor was a notable man and one that had a great influence over him being as well as his master averse to a war with france his lordship however declared himself for it  the next day i went to visit the duke and duchess of lautherdale at their fine house at ham after dinner her grace entertained me in her chamber with much discourse upon affairs of state she had been a beautiful woman the supposed mistress of oliver cromwell and at that time a lady of great parts both her grace and the duke her husband were entirely in the treasurers interest her chief complaint was that the duke so adhered to papists and fanatics and so put the king upon changing the deputies of ireland and all purely for the subservience of the romish interest and in short let me into the secret of many things i had never so much as heard of before and particularly acquainted me with the state and bent of scotland which as her husband was lord commissioner she was well able to do  the day after i went to ask mr secretary williamson if any entry had been made in his office concerning my estate he answered he durst only own it to me in private but that upon some rumor of a forfeiture by some act of mine it was true that mr felton of the bedchamber had begged it of the king and entered a caveat thereof at his office  upon this i prevailed with my lord treasurer to go with me to the king of whom i begged two things namely that he would be pleased to order mr secretary williamson to eraze a caveat that had been entered with him upon his majestys granting away my estate to mr felton reputed to be forfeited by my pretended felonious practices with the blackamoor that died in my service and that also he would be pleased to lay his commands upon my lord chief justice rainsford to discover to me at whose solicitation or upon what suggestion it was his lordship issued out his warrant to the coroner to take up the body after it had been so long interred  to the first the king answered he did not remember any grant he had made of my estate to any person whatsoever but that if any such caveat was entered he would see that it was expunged as for the second he directed my lord treasurer to send one with me to my lord chief justice as from him to do as i had desired which his lordship did the next day by his secretary when we came to him he told us the whole matter and begged i would excuse him for having been so very forward in that affair and indeed he had good reason so to do having done more than he could justify for he had granted his warrant upon a bare suggestion that the moor had dyed by such an act without taking any information either in writing or upon oath  westminster pursuant to adjournment and the king in his speech told the house he could not make such alliances as they desired except they gave him money to make preparations for war the commons did not approve of this and voted that no money should be raised till the king had first entered into a league offensive and defensive with holland and the rest of the united provinces for the safety of these kingdoms and the recovery of flanders and to abate the power of the french king  in answer to this the king said they july following  in the mean time having heard that my lord yarmouth was one that had begged my estate upon the occasion os the death of my black and understanding that his lordship was come to town i presently waited on him at his house and being with some difficulty admitted for i had never seen him asked him if the thing was true whereupon he bitterly swore he never asked it from the king and that he never knew any thing of it farther than that one wright solicitor to the lord henry howard did come and acquaint him that there was likely to be such a forfeiture and advised him to use his interest with the king for it but that he absolutely gave no ear to the proposal saying he would never be the richer for the misfortunes of others that he believed it was pure malice against me and that he would serve me all he could to find out the authors of it in short i got it from under his hand that he was neither directly or indirectly concerned in begging my estate  the very same day i found out mr wright and threatened to bring my action of scandal against him upon the information i had received from my lord yarmouth if he did not let me into the whole intrigue he then ingenuously confessed that both bright and chapel beforementioned had given him an account of the moors death with all the circumstances of his pretended castration and with all assurance of the truth of what they said and that he telling the story to lord henry howard his lordship sent him to lord yarmouth advising him to beg my estate of the king and that he begged it accordingly i was now much surprised that two noblemen should make their honor so cheap and deny a real fact with such oaths and asseverations but considering with my self that to make more stir in the thing would be only to make a great deal of noise about a very foolish story i contented my self with this satisfaction that as a sign of their shame and repentance they had both given themselves the lie  orange and the lady mary first daughter to his royal highness to the great joy of the nation for his highness being a protestant prince this match in a great measure expelled the fears that the majority had conceived concerning popery lord danby the treasurer was believed to have promoted this alliance and got good reputation by it  december was by proclamation prorogued to the  th of april but nevertheless the public business required it the day was shortened and they were to meet on the  0th of january but when the time came they were adjourned for    days  the reason of this short adjournment was because the king could not so fully acquaint both houses why they were called together at this time till he had a more perfect account of a treaty now upon the carpet with spain and after some other discouse of public concern i gave him some assurances of duty and respect which by a former though false report he had foam reason to doubt of  the parliament met and the king in his speech informed them that he was entered in a strict alliance with the prince of orange and the united provinces to oppose the french king and the progress of his arms in flanders and desired he might have money to enable him to fulfill his engagements  orange but observed they could grant no supplies for the war if his majesty and his alies would not engage to lay down their arms till the treaty of the pyrenees was performed and till the french king was reduced to the condition he then was in for that without this neither this kingdom nor the rest of christendom was safe  charles the martyr and for erecting a monument to his memory  supping this night with my lord treasurer he told me he fully had intended to solicit the king to do something for me but if he had really meant it i knew he might have done it long before then    york and had a great deal of discourse with him concerning this matter and being the night before with my lord treasurer the scheme was laid how to proceed the next day  great debates had arisen upon this affair and the reason of the violent opposition it met with was a desire in some to oppose the crown though in the very thing they themselves wished for the nation being ever desirous of a war with france and a jealousy in others that the king indeed intended to raise an army but never designed to go on with the war and to say the truth some of the kings own party were not very sure of the contrary however the commons soon after voted money for the raising six and twenty regiments of foot four of horse and two of dragoons together with a navy of ninety men of war for a war with france  a few days afterward i acquainted the king and the duke with some of the transactions of the house and of the doubts some had there expressed concerning the ratification of the peace betwixt us and holland to which the king replied that the league offensive and defensive was actually signed by the states so that they could not now recede but that the ratification was not yet sealed the several provinces not having yet confirmed the act of their deputies and of the council of eight who had received it  the great business of granting an aid to  france for the preservation of flanders  we had at this time news that the french had taken ghent and bruges and that ostend was besieged whereupon the king caused sixteen hundred men to be immediately drawn out of his guards and other forces here and sent them to ostend under the command of the duke of monmouth in short this news quite alarmed flanders holland and england the commons particularly concerned themselves therein and now grown warm they begin to reflect on the kings ill councils that had not advised him to a war before no man was named but they plainly pointed at the duke of york and the lord treasurer  attending the kings levee his majesty told me and some other members then that except the money voted was speedily raised it would come after the french king had done his work his highness also told me the same morning that his friends would have a hard task of it that day he being informed that some of the house had resolved to renew the debate concerning ill counselors but i assured him it was not likely having but the day before heard a leader of the anticourt party say it was no time to raise disputes at home now that we were in such a way of being embroiled abroad and it proved even as i had said  ghent and bruges had not been taken as had been reported and moreover that mons rouvigny was coming over on the part of france with tenders of peace the parliament started at this and grew jealous the offers would be accepted but still our forces marched onwards in their way to ostend and two days asterwards the bill for raising money by way of poll was perfected when the king and the duke talked much of a war though still it was suspected their hearts were more inclined for peace  his highness told me he was informed orange but that in reality there was no such treaty and had it been he did not think it had been disadvantagious to england another of his crimes he said would be for advising the king to make a peace which he never did though it was not impossible but such a design there might be but that if so it were it proceeded from nothing but the kings own judgment who was that way very much bent if lawful it were so to say  majesty would be pleased to declare war with france and withdraw his ambassador from that court it was also stiffly contended that a part of this address should be to entreat the king to put away those evil counselors from about him who had advised him to adjourn the parliament in may last and prevented a war with france all this time but this being put to the question it was carried in the negative by five votes only    france as had at first been suggested and now it being put to the question lautherdale of the kingdom of scotland it was carried in the negative by one vote only  the question was put again and carried that such counselors as had advised the king to make such answers to the late addresses from his parliament being betrayers of the king and kingdom or to that effect an address should be humbly presented to his majesty to lay them aside from his lautherdale was particularly named and the same day it was carried though but by one voice in a full house that the kings message lately sent to them to consider of some means for a supply to his majesty for paying off his fleet should not be observed  the king understanding the tide of their proceedings to run so very high prorogued  it was at this time generally believed that peace was concluded between us the confederates and the king of france we blamed the states for their ready compliance the states blamed the spaniard who was full of his offers while he had neither men arms or money in flanders to defend it and they both fell upon the parliament of england who when they should have given money and made other preparations for the war were wasting their time in quarrelling at home with the government and with each other  the parliament met pursuant to adjournment when the king spoke to them a little france and the confederates at which they were extremely concerned this peace with france when there was like to be so strong a union combined to reduce that proud and potent king to a better sense of himself was very ungrateful news to england and therefore the king to throw the blame of it upon the commons told us in his speech it was owing to their refusal of money till something was done for the security of their religion their negligence to direct or advise him concerning the intended war or to assist him till he had changed counselors and consequently the little hopes the confederates could have of help from him that this together with the low condition of spain had prompted them to lend an ear to the offers of peace not to speak of the sluggish motion of the germans the difficulty of getting them together their princes being influenced by such discordant views and interests and the present poverty of the states general all which had contributed toward the cessation of the war  but still our king was chiefly condemned in this great affair as he so long deferred to engage in this alliance which had he sooner done the french king had never dared to persist in the war at least he could not have made so great a progress in flanders or have been able to make so good a market for himself as he did by this peace  to this our king made answer he could not have believed the french king would have been able to weather out a war so well as he did though in a manner against all europe himself and the king of sweden only england might well have been satisfied with the having been an unconcerned lookeron while she engrossed all the commerce of europe and might in the end have reaped an equal share of advantage with even the laborers themselves who had been at all the pains and expense    about this time there was fresh discourse france the french king and ours not agreeing concerning the interest of the king of sweden which the french would have to be adjusted before they would deliver up the towns they had taken in flanders but by what i heard i thought the thing had but an unlikely aspect and particularly as i had seen the king duke and french ambassador so very often merry and intimate together at the duchess of portsmouths lodgings laughing at those who believed it in earnest    flanders which had proved an expensive precaution to him that he was deeply in debt that his revenue would not defray the charge of the government that he would satisfy them as to this by laying the whole scheme of his income before them and that he then doubted not but they would make him a proper augmentation that there had been a design against his life by the jesuits and their friends but that he would not descend to the particulars of the thing lest some should think he said too little and others that he said too much in a word he left the whole to their discovery  the two houses but the commons especially took fire at this and immediately voted an address to the king that all papists should be removed ten miles from london and now came on the tragedy of sir edmundbury godfrey and now also appeared doct oats who as he pretended having some jealousy of what was in agitation dissembled himself a papist and got admittance of the jesuits college at st omers where seeing into the whole matter he told it to one doctor tongue an english divine who told it to my lord treasurer who privately told it to the king in such manner that the thing was stifled and latent for a whole month but being with the king portsmouths lodgings my lord treasurer also being present the king told me he took it it to be some artifice and that he did not believe one word of the whole story  colemans affair made also a noise and was an utter stranger to his correspondence as he desired his friends of both houses to declare for him the commons however were very angry with my lord treasurer for keeping the plot so long in the dark seeing the king might have been made away with in the mean time this news i first of any body communicated to his lordship in the presence of the king who said my lord was in no fault as to that he he having commanded him to keep it secret the better to make discovery of what truth there might be therein  now to enter into the particulars of this plot real or pretended is not the design of this work the several narratives of the witnesses before the two houses of parliament and the courts of justice upon the trials of the parties accused give sufficient insight and satisfaction as to all that ca be said of it thus much we may however observe that though a great deal of what was advanced and confidently related bore the face of improbability yet such was the torrent of the times that no doubt was to be made of all that was heard  very plentifully the king having at the request of the commons granted indemnity to all who should make any discovery though ever so deeply and blackly engaged themselves and not only indemnity but subsistence into the bargain at length the commons came to this resolution that upon the evidence which appeared from colemans letters and the informations of oats and others it was plain there was a hellish and damnable design to assassinate and murder the king and to subvert the religion and government as by law established  the house of lords now requested his royal highness to withdraw himself from the kings councils and he complied with the request but the commons went a step higher and were for removing him from about the kings person there were those in the house who argued the danger of this observing that his highness might be thereby tempted to put himself at the head of the popish faction some there were also who moved that the duke should be sent out of england the king and duke both spoke to all their friends to oppose this and it was effectually done for no resolution being taken that day the debate was adjourned to the  th instant but though it came not to the vote the house was generally of opinion that the dukes being of that religion was what principally encouraged the papists to such wicked attempts in short they were by proclamation banished to the distance of ten miles from london  colemans letters were under the consideration of the house i waited several times on my lord treasurer who had called several of us together to consult us about an act to lessen the popish interest in this kingdom when his lordship told us the king was willing something should be enacted to pare as his expression was the nails of a popish successor but that he would never suffer his brother to be taken away from him or the right line to the crown  to pass over other things more generally known a jealousy now seemed to arise between the duke and the lord treasurer the duke thought his lordship was within himself for his leaving the court that so he might have the king the more absolutely in his own power and my lord though i believe he endeavored to serve the duke all he could though no friend to his religion resented the dukes suspicion much was at this time done and transacted in disfavour  the duke of holsteins resident had it seems reported the lord treasurer to be in the pay and pension of france thus at least had his lordship been informed and sending for him he sent for me also to be present at the examination but the resident absolutely denied what was laid to his charge to make amends for this i a few days after acquainted his lordship that the same gentleman had assured me the commons would most certainly fall upon him and that it was in his power to turn the edge of one that was most violent against him i told him also that i had from other hands been informed that my cousin ralph montague since lord montague lately recalled from being ambassador in france and now member of our house would accuse him there but my lord gave no ear to either of these saying the latter durst not impeach him for that he had letters to show from him whilst ambassador that would prove how officious he was to persuade him to accept of the french kings money though he absolutely refused it the same day the duke told me he expected to be attacked by the commons and hoped his friends would stand firm to him and sir joseph williamson secretary of state was by the house committed to the tower for passing the musters of some popish officers without tendering them the oaths though he had his majestys orders for so doing  bedloe the evidence went on apace but being this day with the king his majesty told me bedloe was a rogue and that he was satisfied he had given some false evidence concerning the death of sir edmundbury godfrey  in preparing the bill for purging the house of lords of such as refused the new test it was put to the question whether or no his royal highness should be excused from taking it and it was carried in the affirmative but by no more than two votes had it been carried in the negative he would in the next place have been voted away from the kings presence and now all the popish lords three excepted were expelled the house of peers    the commons were now intent upon disbanding the army raising of money for that purpose and the conviction of popish recusants during which the right of the lords to interfere in a moneybill was warmly contested but not to dwell on so montagues papers to be seized and acquainted the house of commons that having been his ambassador at the french court he had taken on him to treat with the popes nuncio without any commission from him for so doing and that he had seized his papers to come at the purport of the said treaty but montague assured the house that this was a mere artifice a contrivance of the treasurers to save himself but that his lordship had therein failed for that although most of his letters were seized he had by good look saved the most material one of them dated the   th of march      instructed him to acquaint that court with the great difficulties he met withal here in the affair of peace between us and them and the fear there was the parliament should discover it that however he had orders from the king to bid him treat with them for a peace as well between them and the confederates as our selves upon condition the french king would give ours six hundred thousand livers per annum for three years together after the conclusion of the peace for that as our king would thereby disgus the parliament he could expect no money from them of so long a time and finally that when he wrote back to the secretary concerning this transaction he should be silent as to the money and so on signed  danby  this put the house into a flame and a motion was instantly made that the treasurer should be impeached of high treason for that he had endeavored to estrange the king from his parliament and make it of no use to him and one mr powel observed that this was usurping a power to the exclusion of other counselors who had a right to advise the king as well as himself the very treason that was laid to the charge of the spencers and the duke of ireland in the days of richard the second  but it was answered that it was no such great offense to write this by the kings own order as was expressed in the letter it self and would be owned as supposed by the king at this time that the king had certainly a power to advise with which of his counselors he pleased and that if his majesty foresaw the confederates would strike up a peace which we must comply with where was the harm of making what advantage we could of it to our selves and at the same time of sparing the purses of the subject  a second letter was produced which gave assurance of inclinations for a very fair understanding between us and his most christian majesty together with advice to hasten the peace because the duke seemed every day more and more averse to it and mentioned some towns to be given up by the french as cautionary to the confederates upon the conclusion of this peace mr montague then declared in the house that the french king was willing to deliver up two towns more than he did by the former treaty but that my lord treasurer was so earnest and pressing for money that he thereby made the terms much worse for the confederates but at the same time acknowledged he could not say he knew of any money paid either to him or to his majesty other things were now laid to the treasurers charge as the maladministration of his office and the lowness of the exchequer but to this it was answered by his lordships friends that a debt of six hundred thousand pounds had been paid off since he had been in office though no money had in all that time been given to the king but what had been appropriated to the uses designed  he was farther accused this letter bearing date the   th of march      and the act which gave money to the king to enter into a war with france being passed but the  0th of deluding the nation in advising the king to take money for raising an army for service abroad and at the same time treating for money from france to make a peace which looked as if a standing army was designed to humble england and not france in short the question being put it was resolved that an impeachment be drawn up against the lord treasurer and a committee was accordingly appointed for that purpose  mr montague was in this case justly censured for disclosing what had passed through his hands when a public minister without the kings leave mean while france which were read in the house and made it appear that montague had been very guilty of the offenses he threw upon his lordship but his enemies were so many and so powerful that the whole edge was bent against him in a word the tide was not to be stemmed and six articles of impeachment were drawn up against him  but a debate arose whether supposing any of these articles to be true they amounted to high treason none of them being within the statute of edward iii at length the question being put whether or no an impeachment of high treason founded upon the said articles against his lordship should be carried up to the house of lords ays were     and the nos   0 the impeachment then was carried up to the bar of the house of lords where it being presently debated whether or no his lordship should withdraw it was carried in the negative by  0 voices and then both houses adjourned for christmas eve and christmas day only  edmundbury godfrey and quarrelled with the lords on account of the amendment they had made in the moneybill for disbanding the army the same day i spoke both with the king and the duke who both declared they would adhere to my lord treasurer  a conference and the bill passed both houses and here i cannot but take notice that the king observing the lord stafford to be very violent in the house against the lord danby which it seems took birth from a personal pique to him for obstructing a pension he had from the crown told me he wondered at it much seeing his father came to the unfortunate end he did by the very self same method of procedure  february some said in favor of the papists others of the lord treasurer and others again in defense of his prerogative which was more than one way invaded by the commons but his majesty at the same time declared he intended to disband the army and prosecute the business of the plot montague was now discovered in a disguise at dover in his way to france  both to the king and the church which made those of adverse sentiments very desirous of its dissolution and the way they contrived to bring it about as was credibly reported was by persuading the treasurer to obtain it of the king promising if he should succeed therein that there should be no farther prosecution against him in the next parliament but they deceived him as he afterward experienced  burlington but of their assistance also if it came to a controverted election  yorkshire to be favorable to me in the return to conclude having taken leave of the duke of monmouth i left the town to go into the country  being for one and the king recommending another wherefore they refused to enter upon business but adjourned to the  th instant flanders some said the treasurer had brought this to pass that he might engross the king to himself others said it was to divert the violence of both houses against his highness from the suspicion of some that he was of the plot but i presume it was chiefly intended to extirpate all jealousies in the parliament that he was influenced by popish councils though even from his own brother  the commons began to be angry with the treasurer for that the speaker they had proposed had been rejected by the king saying he was the cause of it because truly the gentleman was not his lordships friend this dispute subsisting between the king and the commons they at length address him beseeching him not to invade their undoubted privilege of choosing their speaker but his majesty still insists on it that without his approbation their choice is of none effect now all the moderate men in the house were concerned that such punctilios should stand in the way of business especially when business of such high importance lay before them but the angry party was deaf to all remonstrance and the king by way of expedient prorogued the parliament to the   th instant and from thence to the   th when sergeant gregory being elected both sides were satisfied  the storm now begins to fall heavy upon the lord treasurer insomuch that he has thoughts of delivering up his staff and with it his office in hopes by such resignation to allay the heats against him i was averse to this step i confess and would have had him stood his ground as long as the king would stand by him saying his resignation would but expose him the more to the power of his enemies in short that the lords would fear him the less and the commons not love him a bit the better several persons had got possessed of good employments not so much by my lords favor and kindness as by giving money to his lady who had for some time driven on a private trade of this sort though not without his lordships participation and concurrence this i knew but had neither the face nor the inclination to come in at that door so that i was postponed to many who as i thought deserved as little as my self but they had but a bad bargain they were now all swept away with the same torrent that began to overwhelm his lordship against whom fresh matter now appeared upon the bedloe before the committee appointed to examine into the plot he accusing the treasurer of having tampered with him to fly during this interval of parliament and now every thing went harder and harder with his lordships friends so that my election being controverted the committee of privileges and elections in a few days afterward gave my cause against me by a small majority of two only which considering the stream of the times i reckoned to be as good as half a victory at least  in the mean time a message was sent to day the king coming to the house of lords in the usual state and formality informed both houses that it was by his particular order the lord treasurer had written the two letters produced by montague that it was not the lord treasurer who had concealed the plot but that it was himself who told it his lordship from time to time as he thought fit his majesty then declared he had granted the said nobleman a full pardon and that if occasion required he would give it him again ten times over that however he intended to lay him aside from his employments and to forbid him the court  some would have pesuaded his lordship to take refuge abroad as what would appease both houses and indeed the lords had a conference with the commons about preparing a bill to banish him and the commons desired some days to consider of it in hopes he would have withdrawn in that france as also where i was to make application in his absence if i wanted any thing with the king    a most unhappy thing it is to serve a fickle prince which it must be owned was part of our masters character had the treasurer considered no body but himself he might certainly have fared better but he resolved rather to suffer than to do any thing that might derive any dishonor on the king or others about him as he has since said himself this great change i must own made me seriously ponder the incertitude of human grandeur it was but a few months before that few things were transacted at court but with the privity or consent of this great man the kings brother and favorite mistress were glad to be fair with him and the general address of all men of business was to him who was not only treasurer but prime minister also who not only kept the purse but was the first and greatest confident in all affairs of state but now he is neglected of all forced to hide his head as a criminal and in danger of losing all he has got and his life therewith his family raised from privacy to the degree of marquess a patent was then actually passing to invest him with that dignity is now on the brink of falling below the humble stand of a yeoman nor would almost the meanest subject change conditions with him now who so very lately the greatest beheld with envy this confirmed me in a belief that a middle state is always the best not so lowly as to be trodden on nor so lofty as to fear the blasts of envy a man should not be so wanting in point of industry as not to endeavor to distinguish himself in some sort from the bulk of those of his rank nor yet so ambitious as to sacrifice the ease of this life and of that to come by mounting over the heads of others to a greatness of uncertain duration but to digress no farther  i wrote to his royal highness to acquaint him with the posture of affairs here at present the two houses of parliament continued in division as to what should be inflicted on the fallen treasurer the lords adhering to their bill to banish him and the commons to their bill of attainder till at last it came to a free conference between them this business and the plot engrossed the attention of the houses for a long time during which time it was thought the lord danby lay concealed at whitehall  the king seemed not at all concerned at thus parting with his brother and his treasurer nor in any degree sollicitous about the use the parliament would make thereof though it was suspected they would get their own friends into power and obtain a snip of the prerogative in consideration of the money they gave to his majesty  danby at length surrendering himself was committed prisoner to the tower where going to pay him a visit he seemed to be very little concerned  the privy council of fifty lords was of thirty of those lords and commoners who had in both houses been most active against the late court measures of these were lord russel lord hallifax lord cavendish and others the admiralty was put into commission and so was the treasury the duke of monmouth was supposed to be at the bottom of all this it is certain it was now that he began to set up for himself  danby returned answer to his impeachment to the upper house pleading the kings pardon this was sent down to the commons who referred it to a committee and the result was that his majesty had no power to grant pardon in this case the same day both houses began to cast reflections on the duchess of portsmouth  sunday to consider of the means for the preservation of his majestys person and voted that the best way would be to prevent the succession from falling into the hands of a papist and that the duke of york being such was the reason of the late conspiracy against the kings person and government and the religion as by law established  my lord viscount hallifax being now of the council and entering into business he though a great enemy to the earl of danby professed a kindness for me but here i must observe that most of the other lords and gentlemen of the privy council though great patriots before in the esteem of both houses began in some measure to lose their credit with both so true it is that there is no wearing the court and country livery together  colemans letters and to make report to the house of whatever therein related to the duke of york they reported that by the said letters they had discovered that his highness had written thrice to the pope that his first letter miscarried that the second gave his holiness such an excess of joy that the old gentleman could not refrain from tears and that the third was to excuse the consent he gave to have his daughter married to the prince of orange and to acquaint him that the run of the times had obliged him to such involuntary compliance upon this and some further intimation of the same nature a debate arose whether a bill should be drawn up in the way his majesty had suggested or whether they should immediately proceed to a total exclusion the friends for the limitation argued that we might be as safely secured the one way as the other that a small revenue might be settled upon a popist successor while he contined in that persuasion that the militia might be taken out of his hands and that a parliament might be empowered to assemble whenever the present king should die and to sit for six weeks in order to settle the affairs of the kingdom to appoint protestant officers military and civil and to make choice of bishops which the successor if a papist should have no power to nominate  to this it was objected that such a project of procedure were altering the very frame and constitution of our government and monarchy and directly to reduce it to a republic that it would be quite ineffectual that the king by the fundamental laws of the land was head and supreme of the three estates that a parliament so convened as above could enact nothing valid without him that while he enjoyed the title of king he would exercise a power adequate to his office and that therefore the means proposed were delusory and unsafe in comparison of an utter exclusion it was replied that this expedient was by far more to be avoided than the former that it was depriving the duke of his birthright that if his highness survived he had as clear a claim to succeed the king if he died childless as any man whatever had to succeed to his fathers possessions that probably a prince of his spirit would not easily submit to be so disinherited that such a disturbance of the succession had never in this kingdom been of any lasting effect that right had always prevailed at last that civil wars upon the like occasions had been disastrous to england that success would reverse all attainder and that should his highness force his way to the crown the overthrow of religion and government were more much more to be feared than by his peaceful accession  the next day i acquainted the king with he was very sorry for it but that they should not stay long behind me if they did not use himself and his brother better than they did and promised to continue me in my command at burlington with a salary of two hundred pounds till a company should become vacant which i should have in lieu of mine now to be disbanded with the rest os the army  england this message being taken into consideration the house insisted on a change of the succession and a proper security for religion and a removal of all officers they disliked the kingdom over such was the tenor of the debate but no vote passed except to adjourn the farther consideration of this matter for eight days  now the lords who were in the tower for the plot and my lord danby being shortly to take their trials an arduous question arose in the house of lords concerning the bishops whether or no they ought to be present in cases of blood whereupon the commons thinking these spiritual lords would be of too favorable an inclination took the consideration of the same into their house and came to an opinion they ought not to be present this was resented by the lords as if the commons interfered with a branch of their judicature in short the dispute grew to be of great warmth  mean while the kingdom in general had a very melancholy aspect the king was poor the officers of the crown and of the household were clamorous for their salaries and dues which had not of a long time been paid and no wonder when sir robert howard one of the chief officers of the exchequer declared in the house of commons that there was not money sufficient for bread for the kings family there were no stores any where either for the sea service or the land the garrisons were all out of repair the platforms decayed and the cannon dismounted the army divided for the duke of york and against him the officers of state the same the parliament for the most part in a ferment and glad of these public misunderstandings as favoring their desire of clipping the wings of the prerogative reducing the height of monarchy and furthering their private designs the king also and his brother at variance and so kept by those who promised to make his majesty quite easy if he would but comply with them so far as to disinherit the duke so that he was quite in suspense as to what resolution he should or should not take  the duke of monmouth was certainly very much in the kings affections was evidently in councils against his uncle of york for all his creatures in the house voted against his highness nor were any men higher in his estimation than the earls of shaftsbury and essex and other chiefs of the cabal the truth is though the duke of monmouth was quite finished as to his exterior his inside was by no means of a piece therewith so that he was easily beguiled by shaftsbury into the flattering notion of being the duke disinherited the next heir to the crown either by the kings delaring marriage with his mother or by being made legitimate by act of parliament and indeed though at the instances of the duke of york the king had openly in council declared that the duke of monmouth was but his natural son and that he never was married to his mother there were numbers ready to assert his right and who pretended that sufficient witness was to be produced of such as were actually at the wedding and that a record of the same was kept in a black box in custody of some of the duke of monmouths friends but to dismiss this    two days afterward i was at the kings couchee and wondered to see him quite cheerful amidst such an intricacy of troubles but it was not his nature to think or perplex himself much about any thing i had the good fortune to say something that pleased his majesty and the duke of newcastle one of the bedchamber being in waiting his grace took the opportunity of saying some kind things of me whereupon his majesty came to me and reassured me of a continuance in my command and told me he would stick by his old friends  but the lords persisting in their opinion that their spiritual members might be present at the trial of the prisoners and particularly of the earl of danbys as to the validity of his pardon which was his plea and on the other hand the commons voting that the said lords should not be present and resolving only to proceed against that earl and not the rest of the prisoners though the time appointed for the trial of them all was come extraordinary heats arose between the two houses insomuch that his majesty came and told them that not perceiving which way they were to be reconciled he prorogued them till the   th of august the city of london where the anticourt party was very strong took so great offense at this and were so angry that it was thought they would have risen but all with much ado was hushed and kept quiet  scotland to the number of  000 men that they had burnt several acts of parliament as the act of uniformity and episcopacy as also the act which abolished and condemned the covenant that they had set forth a declaration for jesus christ the kirk and the covenant in short some troops that were ordered out against them being defeated the duke of monmouth was sent post haste into scotland to stop the progress of this infant rebellion  the king told me he had an account that the two armies were but ten miles distant  monmouth was to be at doncaster post out of scotland i went to meet him and sent half a buck and some extraordinary sorts of wine to entertain him there he came not till midnight and raised me out of the bed designed for him his delay tempting me to think he would hardly be in that night sir thomas armstrong was with him and told me the king had heard some falsehoods concerning the duke and had in all haste sent for him out of scotland and indeed it happened to be understood that after his victory he was about laying a foundation whereon to succeed in that kingdom and by the industry of his agents making himself popular  the duke of york who had been sometime abroad suddenly appeared again in england to see the king who as was pretended had not been well the duke of monmouth who thought he had the king to himself knew nothing of it till his highness actually arrived at windsor nor were there above four persons who knew any thing at all of the matter so close and reserved could the king be when he conceived it to be necessary this revocation of the duke was principally owing to the intervention of lord feversham who afterward told me the whole story and now it was thought that the parliament being chiefly made up of exclusionists would be but very shortlived the duke however went back again but it was only to fetch his duchess whom he had left behind him returning presently with his whole court from flanders and desiring of the king that if he must needs be absent he might rather remain in some part of his majestys dominions and so he was sent into scotland his highness then proceeded northward but lord shaftsbury being soon after removed the exclusionists began to despair of success nor was that all for the duke of monmouth having been sent into flanders and returning without the kings leave drew such displeasure on him that he was divested of all his employments soon after i heard the duke had been sent for from scotland by the king that the two brothers no body should ever part them for the future and with this we conclude this year  london to solicit some business at court but the application of all men being to the duke who quite engrossed the king to himself his highness had but little leisure to give ear to or assist his friends for as such he seemed to look on me when i attended him at york the last year as he went down to scotland and indeed there was small hopes of succeeding in money requests as mine was the king every day retrenching rather than increasing his expenses that so he might stand the less in need of his parliament which he despaired of finding in any good humor  there were at this time great meetings of persons dissatisfied with the court where consultations were held to distress the king upon all occasions whether in parliament or out of it and these resorts were called cabals the duke of monmouth the earl of shaftsbury and the lords russel cavendish and others where the chiefs of these assemblies which for the greater privacy shifted every night from house to house the public outcry pretending fears of popery and the safety of the king  windsor came to town but once a week to be present at council and finding the friends i had with the king were but of little service to me i went my self to windsor and acquainted monmouths mother and informed him how he might obviate it for which he thanked me and told me without my asking it that he had been mindful of my business the king showed me a great deal of what he had done to the house which was indeed very fine and acquainted me with what he intended to do more for then it was he was upon finishing that most majestic structure he lived quite privately at this time there was little or no resort to him and his days he passed in fishing or walking in the park and certain it is he was much better pleased with retirement than the hurry of the gay and busy world  windsor a few days afterward and had all assurances from the duke of constant services with the king in what i solicited which was to go abroad in quality of envoy extraordinary and at the same time taking my leave of his majesty he laid his hand upon my shoulder and said he was very sensible of my services and that they should be rewarded i took this opportunity to put him in mind of his promise to send me abroad and mentioned a nobleman who was present when he made it and he said he remembered it particularly well and that upon the very first occasion he would be as good as his word  york was to depart before the meeting of the parliament some said in obedience to the kings orders others to avoid the violence of both houses for plain and most evident it was that the papists lifted up their crest with great arrogance presuming on support from the duke who now reigned absolute in all the kings affairs in short the duke and duchess sat scotland and the next they were free to do whatever they would for the security of the protestant religion provided they did not offer to divert the direct line of the succession  but still the commons went on this month and the next to frame a bill to exclude the duke of york from the succession and the gentlemen and others of yorkshire who had counterpetitioned and declared their abhorrence of the tumultuous petition for a meeting of parliament were voted betrayers of the liberties of the people and abettors of arbitrary power a committee was also appointed to inquire into the matter and after the persons concerned therein and two members of the house both of yorkshire who had set their hands to the abhorrence were convened before them but i who was the penman of that instrument had done it so cautiously that no hold could be fastened no exceptions taken and so they got off  yorkshire gentlemen to which his majesty made answer do not trouble your self i will stick by you and my old friends for if i do not i shall have no body to stick by me but yet it was by a great many feared he was not quite resolved as to this profession for money was so exceedingly wanting and the offers of the parliament so very fair if he would but give up his brother that no body was safe what added to the suspicion was that many who were well in the kings esteem appeared for the bill of exclusion nor was it unknown that the duchess of portsmouth was well inclined to it whether artfully to insinuate herself into the good graces of the party who had been at greatest enmity with her or in compliance with the french whose tool she was who was ready to catch at any thing to embroil us at home is uncertain  a few days afterward i happened to be at the duchess of portsmouths where the king was quite unreserved and very open as to the witnesses who were making out the popish plot and proved to a demonstration that many articles they had given in evidence were not only improbable but quite impossible  to the importance of the business they had in hand which concerned no less than the lineal succession to the crown the bill having passed the commons who sent it up to the lords great was the debate and great were the speakers the chief of those for the bill was the earl of shaftsbury the chief of those against it lord hallifax it was matter of surprise that the latter should appear at the head of an opposition to the former when they were wont always to draw together but the business in agitation was against the lord hallifaxs judgment and therefore he opposed it with vigor and being a man of the clearest head finest wit and fairest eloquence he made so powerful a defense that he alone so all confessed influenced the house and persuaded them to throw out the bill  the king was so highly pleased with the transactions of this day that he soon after took this great lord into business but on the other hand the commons were so angry with him that though they could regularly take no notice of what any man said in the other house they voted an address to the king to lay him aside and remove him from his councils and presence to this he answered that if lord hallifax had done any thing contrary to law he was willing he should be prosecuted and punished accordingly but that not being satisfied he had done any thing amiss he could not part with him or words to that effect one would have thought that so signal a piece of service lord hallifax did to his highness had been of a degree and nature never to be forgot but when the duke afterward came to be king he from the privy seal where he found him removed him to the presidency of the council purely to make room for another and in the end quite laid him aside  burlington where i was governor to make it appear a garrison and that if i was i presumed i should be of the number of those they intended to petition his majesty to lay aside to this the king answered let them do what they will i will never part with any officer at the request of either house my father lost his head by such compliance but as for me i intend to dye another way  hallifax as we have observed before having defeated the bill of exclusion in the house of lords was beheld as the rising man and premier favorite i waited on him and the next day he took me in his coach to white hall and invited me to dine with him in private in our conversation together he told me it was to be feared some unhappy differences might distract the nation from these uneasinesses about the succession and that in case things should unhappily ripen to a war it might be proper to form something of a party in ones own thoughts he said he knew there was but another and my self that had any considerable influence in my neighborhood in consequence of which and some further conversation this way i the next day carried him the names and characters of all the considerable men in those parts and upon the whole we agreed that the loyalists were not only the most numerous but also the most active and wealthy and that those who in parliament were against the court were men of little account or estimation i their own country  but to turn our eyes upon what justly claimed the attention of all men now came on the trial of lord stafford by his peers westminster hall was the place and i think it was the deepest solemnity i ever saw great were the expectations of the issue of this event it being doubtful whether there were more who believed there was any plot by the papists in reality against the kings life than not he was impeached by the commons and being deemed to be weaker than the other lords in the tower for the same crime and less able to labor his defense was purposely marked out to be the first brought on but he deceived them so far as to plead his cause to a miracle the three chief evidences against him were dr oats dugdale and turberville the first swore that his lordship had brought him a commission signed by the pope to be paymaster of the army to be raised against the king the second that he had offered him five hundred pounds to kill the king and the third that he had offered him a reward for the dreadful deed but at a different time and so positive seemingly were they in this and other dangerous evidence that i who sat and heard most of the trial had not known what to think had the witnesses been but men of any the least credit but indeed such were the incoherences and indeed contradictions which seemed to me to arise toward the latter end that considering them and the very evil name of the people that swore against this lord i was fully satisfied that all was untruth they laid to his charge but the poor gentleman was condemned by a majority of    he heard his accusers and defended himself with great steadiness and resolution and received his sentence with great courage and composure nor did he stoop beneath the weight of his doom till he submitted his head to the block with his last breath protesting his innocence and the cruel wrong he suffered my lord hallifax was one that gave his voice for him and the king who heard all his trial was extremely concerned at the rigor and abruptness of his fate  hallifaxs i discovered what was then generally unknown that his lordship sat up for first minister for i saw the french ambassador come privately to him upon business this same day the commons were asked what they would do for the king after so long a sitting to no effect as to the matters his majesty required of them they voted this answer that they would put him into a condition to defend tangiers pay off all his debts put the fleet into a condition and enable him to assist his allies provided he would relinquish the duke his brother pass an act for the more frequent meeting of parliament and change such officers about him as the house should point out there were many who believed the king would be tempted to comply but the very next day seeing my lord hallifax he assured me there was not the least probability that he would for that it was like offering a man money to cut off his nose  the same day the unfortunate lord stafford came to the house of lords and was admitted under a notion that he had some discovery or confession to make concerning the popish plot but instead of that he only protested his own innocence and accused lord shaftsbury of a correspondence with the papists and of sending him to the duke of york to desire him to use his interest with the king to dissolve the long parliament as the best thing that could be done to favor the popish interest and so he was remanded back again  i was at the kings couchee when there the straits he was in seemed no ways to embarrass him as i just now observed  gunning bishop of ely the famous dr oats was of the company at table and flushed with the thoughts of running down the duke of york expressed himself of his highness and his family in terms that bespoke him a fool and something worse nor contented with this but he must rail at the queen his mother and her present majesty in this strain did he hurry on while no soul dared to oppose him for fear of being made a party of the plot till no longer able to bear with the insolence of the man i took him to task to such purpose that he flung out of the room with some heat the bishop told me that such was the general drift of his discourse that he had sometimes checked him for the indecency of his talk but that finding he had done it to no manner of purpose he had desisted from any further effort to set bounds to his virulence  in the mean time lord stafford was led tower hill where he persisted in the firmest denial of what was laid to his charge and that in so cogent convincing and persuasive a manner that all the beholders believed his words and grieved his destiny the same day i dined with my lord hallifax who said to me well if it comes to a war you and i must go together i told his lordship i should be ready to follow him happen what would but that if the king expected his friends to be hearty in his cause and steady to his person he should consider with himself and encourage them a little and thereupon acquainted him with some of my disappointments at court notwithstanding the most solemn reiterated promises and added that i should be glad his majesty would send me his envoy to some part of the world or other but to return to things of more public and general concern  hallifax clarendon feversham the marquess of worcester and mr hyde since lord rochester upon this the parliament was prorogued from the  0th to the  0th of january some thought in order for a dissolution while others persisted that the king would suffer them to sit at that time and pass the bill waiting this day on lord hallifax he complained much of the severity of the commons in their vote that he was a promoter of popery and a betrayer of the people which said he were a man ever so innocent yet coming from the representative body of the people is too heavy for the shoulders of any one single person that he had therefore some thoughts of retiring from court but that however he would go his own pace and not be kicked out at their pleasure that if for the future the king should have occasion for him in any thing that was just he should be ready to serve him that if i would repose a confidence in him he would let me know when it was time to appear for the kings service and that i should share fortunes with him and so on but at the same time he complained of the fickleness and incertitude of the kings temper and observed that while he seemed perfectly to approve of the council you gave him he hearkened to others from a back door which made him wavering of mind and slow to resolve the next day i waited on lord danby in the tower and he spoke of the kings unsteadiness in the very self same strain and particularly observed that though the duke of york had but little influence with him as to what purely regarded himself the minister would find him an overmatch with his majesty as to any other person or concern the same day the duke of newcastle told me he was to wait on the king the next and that he fancied he would offer him some employment but that as his majesty had not done it in better times he would excuse himself now that they were so dangerous which recalled to my mind what lord hallifax had observed a few days before that the kings uncertainty and silence as to what he proposed to himself made men afraid to serve him  london petitions the king by their common council for the sitting of the parliament at the time appointed to which the king made answer it was none of their business and it was the discourse that the parliament would be dissolved and a new one called to sit at oxford my lord hallifax seemed averse to this dissolution but he only seemed so he could certainly have no very cordial wishes toward those who dealt so severely as he thought with him my lord was now jealous that the earl of danby would be taken out of the tower and received again into councils which if it happened his resolution was to retire and his advice to me was not to press for employment till things were established upon a more solid foundation    at length a new parliament was called to oxford whither being elected a member i repaired and waited on the king who received me very kindly i told him i had it in charge from several gentlemen of our county to acquaint him they had no part in the petition offered to the knights of their shire to prosecute the bill of exclusion against his highness and that the thing had been managed but by six or seven factious persons though it had been industriously reported to be a more general concern his majesty said he had already received some short account to the same purpose and ordered me to return his thanks to those who did not busy themselves therein  christchurch and the commons sat in the schools but were very much straightened for room there being a very great concourse of members his majestys speech to both houses was very gracious and calculated to reconcile all differences and to disperse all jealousies as to religion etc but was still averse to what former parliaments had so pushed at the exclusion of his brother from the name and power of king and yet the first point debated was whether or no notwithstanding the kings speech a bill of exclusion should not be framed and brought in but for the present it was only voted that the security of his majestys person and of the protestant religion should be taken into consideration the   th instant  not to insist on the impeachment of fitzharris which was done not to destroy but to serve him in opposition to the court the grand argument for the bill of exclusion was that nothing could preserve us from popery but that alone now the whole house was of opinion that popery was to be kept out the dispute was only as to the means of effecting it the king had in his speech offered to agree to any thing that might serve to quiet the minds of the people as to that particular the utter exclusion of his brother only excepted it was therefore moved by sir thomas littleton that a bill to secure the protestant religion should be brought in and consist of the following heads that the duke of york should enjoy the title and the princess of orange exercise the power that if a parliament should be in being when it should please god to take away the present king they should have power to sit that the judges and all other officers of the crown should be continued till liberty and property were secured that if there was no parliament subsisting one should assemble of course and that to prevent the dukes interfering to prevent this he should by the same act be banished to the distance of  00 miles from england not to return as long as the king lived to this it was objected that the name and power of king were inseparable by the laws england that the father would soon find a way to divest the daughter of her power that a regency was never known but in cases of lunacy and minority and that the duke was not of a turn of disposition to be easily governed but to this it was replied that regencies had been frequently allowed in other cases besides incapacity and lunacy as formerly in france and now in portugal that princes were seldom so complaisant as to resign kingdoms or powers though to a father and that as for the authority of parliament in this case no question but the same power that could alter the government could also modify it but exclusion was the word some seven or eight disgusted lawyers and able speakers joined by some others who had been so active in this matter that they thought should the duke ever come to the crown he could never forgive them wrought so prevalently upon the members in general that it was voted a bill should be brought in to incapacitate james duke of york from succeeding to the imperial crown of this realm nor during this debate did some forbear to reflect on his highnesss courage and honor  fitzharriss impeachment observing that he being already indicted at common law and in a way of trial by his peers as magna charta directed they could not perceive how their house could take notice of his offense the commons hereupon grew angry with the lords and voted that such their lordships proceeding was a delay of justice a breach of the privilege of parliament and a bar to the further discovery of the popish plot and that for any inferior court to proceed therein while an impeachment was depending was an high breach of the privilege of parliament the heats grew in short to an excess in both houses both as to this and the bill of exclusion the commons however were of opinion that the king would give way to them he having already made such advances toward their measures and being in such thorough distress for money besides that many who were near the king urged them to persist still in their endeavors but on the very day the king had appointed the theater observing a great difference to have taken place between the two houses which if they sat any longer might increase to a pernicious degree it was his pleasure to dissolve that parliament a blow so little foreseen that there were those who thought there would have been some stirs or risings about it in london  it was now observed that many of the discontented members of both houses came armed and more than usually attended and it was affirmed there was a design to have seized the king and to have restrained him till they had granted their petitions but if any such design there was it happened that the parties either wanted the courage or the opportunity to put it in execution the king immediately departed with all speed for london  his majesty was so kind as to afford me several opportunities of speaking to him while i was at oxford and lord hallifax taking leave of him and in a particular manner recommending me to his thoughts his majesty laid both his hands upon me and thanked me for my constancy to his interest and bad me be assured of his affection  by this abrupt dissolution and what i had heard from lord hallifax and others i concluded the king was determined never to relinquish his brother as also to call no other parliament for a long time yet to come the truth is the question now was not so much whether the duke should succeed or not as whether the government should be monarchial or republican some of the adverse side had in the house babbled out that the bill of exclusion was not the only material bill they intended to get passed this session in order to secure the people of england from falling a prey to popery and arbitrary power that it was necessary the military and civil power too should be lodged in other hands and that the present officers of both should be called to an account and changed whence the king being told that if he quitted his brother it would be but an immediate step taken to ruin all his friends and servants and to become himself exposed to the will and wishes of those whom he had no reason to think were over and above affected to him the king dreaded the consequences and resolved accordingly  i was at the kings couchee as i was three times in one week his discourse ran fitzharris should come upon his trial immediately that in all affairs relating to himself the laws should have their regular course and that whatever his own private opinion might me he would govern by them and by them only a happiness indeed it was for his people to live under so good and so gracious a prince and now we begin to have a prospect of halcyon days again for his majesty having since the last parliament was dissolved issued out a declaration fraught with the fairest promises to his people and assuring them of his firm intentions to govern inviolably according to law and the like it had so happy an effect that he received the thanks of the city of london by the lord mayor and of several counties and corporations in england  fitzharris is arraigned at the kings bench bar where by his council he refused to plead because he stood in parliament impeached for the crimes he there was to be indicted for though the impeachment specified no particular treasons which the indictment did the council for the king said his plea was evasive it not appearing whether the same crimes were intended by the one as by the other  oxford the judges took time to consider of it but two fitzharris received sentence of death for his treason and was executed accordingly  shaftsbury and lord howard were now sent prisoners to the tower and my lord hallifax told me there would be enough produced against them to hang them both a short time afterward i was by my lord hallifax presented to the king in his closet to take my leave of him being speedily to set out for yorkshire his lordship who was now become absolute favorite presented me to his majesty and spoke to him very kindly of me and particularly desired him to confirm to me the promise he had sometime ago made to his lordship that i should succeed in the government of york his majesty did it very willingly without the least hesitation and gave me his hand to kiss upon the same saying he was convinced how well i deserved of him  london and the next day my lord hallifax told me that lord shaftsbury had written to the king that if he would be pleased to free him from his confinement he would engage to go to carolina never more to return into england but that the king had rejected his request and determined to leave him to the law he also told me that were it not for the interest the king of france had here he did not doubt but he should be able to put england into a very happy state and condition in a very short time that there was no hopes of doing any thing by way of parliament except his majesty should make some new attempt upon flanders and that such an incident might be made use of as a handle whereby to reconcile all differences  such an opportunity offered it self soon after that news came the french king had taken strasburgh whereby becoming master of the rhine he might intercept all communication and commerce between the low countries and germany so that the netherlands would be absolutely obliged to bend the knee to france if we did not enter into a league with them against the common adversary which they did most earnestly solicit but our king could lend them no helping hand without a parliament to supply him with money and what distress his majesty labored under as to that was sufficiently understood particularly by france who determined not to slip the advantage so that what my lord hallifax expected from such an occurrence proved to be all a delusion  jamess park and at the duchess of portsmouths his discouse ran chiefly upon the late unequal verdicts and proceedings of the juries of london and middlesex concerning which he broke out into this expression it is a hard case that i am the last man to have law and justice in the whole nation  his majesty went to see a new ship launched at deptford he went in his barge and i waited on him to the waterside he saw me and called me in the gentleman who was appointed to the command of her gave a great dinner to the king where his majesty commanded all the gentlemen to sit down at the same table he was more than usually serious that day and seemingly under a greater weight of thought than had been observed of him on account of the most important business  danby still a prisoner in the tower who by the drift of his discourse was not in charity with the then ministers seemingly reflecting on them as too favorable inclined toward shaftsbury and so on two days afterward i acquainted my lord hallifax with this to which his answer was that people were mighty ready with their judgments and decisions but that if the fact were even as suggested what could the king do better than set him at liberty that he had as good be enlarged upon terms as by a jury which would most assuredly acquit him were he brought to a trial though ever so deep in guilt and that were he out he could not do the king so much harm as such an act of mercy and popularity would do him good the same day one of the under secretaries told me the king was resolved to prosecute him to the utmost and that there was no want of very sufficient matter against him  but before we come to the issue of such his majestys resolution it may not be amiss to observe by the way that my lord hallifax being by no means a friend to france was upon no good footing with the duchess of portsmouth which gave the king some trouble as it proved a hindrance to the currency of his affairs wherefore he sought  and now pursuant to the kings resolution shaftsbury should take his trial a commission of oyer and terminer was issued out for that purpose and the most capital articles of his accusation having been committed in london the jury was there returned for the finding of the bill and though a paper was produced containing no less than matter of high treason which was sworn to have been found among the papers in his closet by a secretary of state yet such were the times that the grand jury brought in their verdict ignoramus  in consequence of this he was enlarged london and middlesex had now strict orders to prevent the like tumultuous doings now there were those who considering how nearly lord hallifax was related to shaftsbury imagined his lordship was not grieved that the latter was no longer a prisoner and indeed what made me among others bend a little this way was that waiting on his lordship a little early i found one of my lord shaftsburys gentlemen with him but his lordship denied it all very seriously to me and said he would ere long convince the world of their mistake  shaftsburys jury and it fell to my lot to explain several things in french relating to the matter in hand a few days afterward his majesty monmouth upon several accounts but especially for having offered to be bail for shaftsbury the next day he made the duke of richmond his master of the horse and gave one of the regiments of foot guards to the duke of grafton and now times for it was shrewdly suspected he was not in earnest sent for the justices of middlesex to appear before him in council where he gave them a severe reprimand for that they were so remiss in their inquiry after the number of papists and so backward to prosecute them he spoke not himself but did it by the lord chancellor and ordered them to be more vigilant mindful and active for the time to come  the same day having been to visit the duchess of portsmouth my lord hallifax took me home with him from whitehall on the way i acquainted him that the general report was that his lordship opposed the duke of yorks interest with the king and his return from scotland which his highness most urgently pressed his reply was that it was well if the dukes overhastiness did not turn to his disadvantage that his highness had a sort of hungry servants about him who were eternally pressing for his return nor would ever let him be at rest till with a view to their own interest they put their master upon what might prove much to his prejudice and true it is that whilst his highness was near the kings person every body believed his majesty to be principally swayed and actuated by his advice and consequently that popish councils were then uppermost whereas he did a great deal of good in scotland by keeping a watchful eye over that mutinous kingdom but the papists and others his highnesses creatures pretended he was kept in scotland that his enemies might the more easily work him out of his brothers good opinion and that the ministers might have the king all to themselves and guide him according to their own will and pleasure upon this lord hallifax observed there was great partiality in the judgment of men for that in common justice they ought to take as much notice of things that were managed for the dukes advantage as of what seemed to be otherwise that for instance no body had commended the ministers for getting the duke of richmond to be master of the horse in prejudice to the duke of monmouth though it must prove a great obstacle to his return to the kings person and though most evident it was that no greater service could be done to his highness than to keep the duke of monmouth from court  about this time i had a view of going denmark but to wave that i this day carried a gentleman one mr grant a leader of the fanatic party to wait on my lord hallifax he acquainted his lordship with the double dealings of some great men at court against him who had been particularly instrumental in exasperating the commons against him in the late parliaments which my lord took as a piece of service done as it would put him upon his guard against the same men for the future at the same time i conducted a gentleman to my lord to ask his pardon for some things he had been reported to have said against his lordship in good policy we ought to suffer no man to be our enemy if we can possibly avoid it but such was his lordships natural disposition that in the whole course of my life i never knew a man more ready at all times to forgive and shall never forget his expression upon this occasion sir if you did not say the words i am very glad of it and even if you did i am glad you find cause to be of another mind in a private conversation i at the same time had with his lordship he told me that the people about the duke of york made him mad that there was scarce one of them that had a grain of sense and intimated that a parliament could not be far off  the next day i went to see lord danby in the tower he told me lord sunderland was ever railing at lord hallifax though his brotherinlaw and observing him to express some satisfaction thereat i presumed to remonstrate to him that being a friend to both i could wish now that he was a prisoner he would forget all occasion of animosity against a gentleman in such high power as my lord hallifax for that when a parliament should be called his lordship might stand in need of his assistance and the good offices of his friends  morocco who was admitted with more than ordinary form the king being of opinion that a commerce established between that empire and his kingdom might prove of considerable profit to us especially as we had so opportune a place on that continent as tangiers the ambassadors present to the king consisted of two lions and thirty ostriches at which his majesty laughed and said he knew nothing more proper to send by way of return than a flock of geese  lumley at lord fevershams when the former declared he had speedy intentions of resigning his post of master of the horse to the queen which he had hitherto enjoyed independantly of the master of the horse to the king but it seems the duchess of portsmouth had prevailed with the king to alter his patent and to make him an officer under the duke of richmond contrary to his promise the duchess was certainly sometimes to blame in things of this nature for to display her power with the king which indeed was great and to express her friendship to some she would often persuade the king to break his engagements with others which was not for his honor and yet his majesty was not at this time thought to be charmed with her bed it being generally believed he had not lain with her since he was at newmarket at least four months before i also heard this day that one of the three ministers was endeavoring at a reconciliation with a great man who was no friend to my lord hallifax and immediately warning his lordship thereof he thanked me and told me the information would be of good use to him  we had now advice that infinite damage had been done to ostend antwerp and the circumadjacencies by the most dreadful inundation that had ever been known that holland had suffered most prodigiously by the flood that the greatest part of zealand was under water and that several towns and villages had been swept away with all their inhabitants and that according to computation it would require an expense of ten millions sterling to make good the loss the levels also in yorkshire and lincolnshire were laid under water by the same fate the incessant rains of this season having been the cause thereof  hallifax argued that all christendom was desirous of it france only excepted and that nothing could be offered to discountenance it at home but the fear they might touch upon high points which if they did his majesty might dismiss or dissolve them just as he pleased and convince the world that it was their fault and not his and evince that he endeavored to give his people satisfaction by the means of frequent parliaments that if the king and the parliament agreed his majesty would thereby gain the grand points of being united at home and formidable abroad but some as seymour and hyde were against the motion more for their own sakes than any bodys else  england mr thynn a gentleman of  000 l per annum and lately married to lady ogle who repenting herself of the match fled from him into holland before they were bedded was set upon by three russians who shot him as he was going along the street in his coach this unhappy gentleman being much engaged in the duke of monmouths cause it was feared that party might put some violent construction on this accident the actors therein making their escape just for the time and being unknown i happened to be at court that evening when the king hearing the news seemed greatly concerned at it not only for the horror of the action it self which was shocking to his natural disposition but also for fear the turn the anticourt party might give thereto i left the court and was just stepping into bed when mr thynns gentleman came to me to grant him an hue and cry and immediately at his heels comes the duke of monmouths page to desire me to come to him at mr thynns lodging sending his coach for me which i made use of accordingly i there found his grace surrounded with several lords and gentlemen mr thynns friends and mr thynn himself mortally wounded with five shot from a blunderbuss i on the spot granted several warrants against persons suspected to have had a hand therein and that night got some intelligence concerning the actors themselves at length by the information of a chairman who had carried one of the russians from his lodging at westminster to the black bull there to take horse and by means of a loose woman who used to visit the same person the constables found out the place of his abode and there took his man by nation a swede who being brought before me confessed himself a servant to a german captain who had told him he had a quarrel with mr thynn and had often ordered him to watch his coach and that particularly that day the captain no sooner understood the coach to be gone by than he booted himself and with two others a swedish lieutenant and a pole went on horseback as he supposed in quest of mr thynn duke of monmouth lord mordaunt and others searched several houses as he directed us till six in the morning and having been in close pursuit all night i personally took the captain in the house of a swedish doctor in leicesterfields i went first into his room followed by lord mordaunt where i found him in bed with his sword at some distance from him on the table his weapon i in the first place secured and then his person committing him to two constables i wondered he should make so tame a submission for he was certainly a man of great courage and appeared quite unconcerned from the very beginning though he was very certain he should be found the chief actor in the tragedy this gentleman had not long before commanded the forlorn hope at the siege at mons when but two besides himself of fifty under his command escaped with life and in consideration of this service the prince of orange made him a lieutenant of his guards and in reward for the same the king of sweden gave him a troop of horse but to insist no farther on this his two accomplices also were taken and brought to my house where before i could finish the several examinations i had to go through the king sent for me to attend him in council for that purpose with the prisoners and papers his majesty ordered me to give him an account of the proceedings hitherto as well with regard to the apprehending of the prisoners as their examination and then examined them himself and when the council rose ordered me to put every thing into writing and in form against the trial which took me up a great part of the day though i had got one of the clerks of the council and another justice of the peace to assist me both for the sake of dispatch and my own security the nicety of the affair requiring it as will in the sequel appear  coningsmark a young gentleman then in mr fouberts academy in london and supposed to be privy to the murder upon this occasion the king sent for me to attend in council where the said governor confessing that the eldest count coningsmark who had been in england some months before and made his addresses to the lady who so unfortunately married mr thynn arrived incognito ten days before the said murder and lay disguised till it wa committed gave great cause to suspect that the count was at the bottom of this bloody affair and his majesty ordered me thereupon to go and search his lodgings which i did with two constables but the bird was flown he went away betimes in the morning of the day after the deed was perpetrated of which i immediately gave the king an account  i several times afterward attended on the king both in private and in council from time to time to give him information as fresh matter occurred or appeared and upon the whole it was discovered partly by the confession of the parties concerned and partly by the information of others that the german captain had been for eight years an intimate with count coningsmark one of the greatest men in the kingdom of sweden his uncle being at that time governor of pomerania and near upon marrying the kings aunt and moreover that during the time he was in england before he had made his addresses to lady ogle the only daughter and heiress of the earl of northumberland who had been married to the deceased mr thynn and that the said count had resented something as an affront from mr thynn that the captain moved thereto out of pure friendship to the count though not at all with his privity as pretended had determined within himself to revenge his cause and that in consequence of such his resolution the murder happened it appeared also that such his cruel design was furthered by the assistance of the swedish lieutenant and the pole who had been by him obliged to discharge the blunderbuss into the coach i was extremely glad that in this whole business there was no english person directly or indirectly concerned for the fanatics had buzzed it about that the design was chiefly against the duke of monmouth so that i had the kings thanks more than once the thanks of my lord hallifax and several others for my diligence in tracing out the true springs and motives of this horrid action as well as the actors themselves the duke of monmouth had been out of the coach above an hour and by the confession of the criminals i found they were not to have made the attempt if his grace had been with mr thynn  mean while it was suspected that count coningsmark was still in the kingdom and search being made after him he was met with alone in disguise at gravesend by a servant of the duke of monmouths just as he was stepping out of a sculler intending the very next day to embark on board of a swedish ship being brought up to town the king immediately called an extraordinary council to examine him i was present upon this occasion and observed that he appeared before the king with all the assurance imaginable he was a fine person of a man and i think his hair was the longest i ever saw he was very quick of parts but his examination was very superficial for which reason he was by the king and council ordered to be the same day examined by the lord chief justice the attorney general and my self but he confessed nothing of the murder pretending the reason why he lay at this time concealed to be that he was then under cure for a small venereal disaster and did not care to appear in public till the course of his prescription was over and that his going away in disguise after the fact was committed was by the advice of friends who told him it would reflect on him should it be known he was in england when an intimate of his labored under so violent a suspicion of having committed so black a deed and that he endeavored to make his escape not knowing how far the laws of this land might for that very reason involve him in the guilt but being at the kings couchee  foubert who kept the academy in london came and desired me to put him in a way how to save count coningsmarks life insinuating to me that as he was a man of vast fortune he could not make a better use of it than to support his own innocence and shield himself from the edge of the law in a strange country i told him that if the count was really innocent the law would naturally acquit him as much though a foreigner as if he was a native but that he ought to be cautious how he made any offers to pervertjustice for that it were to make all men of honor his enemies instead of gaining them to be his friends this was one of the first bribes of value ever offered to me which i might have accepted without any danger of discovery and without doing much for it but my opinion has always been that what is so acquired is no addition to our store but rather the cause of its waste according to the saying male parta male delabuntur i therefore rejected this now as i had done others before and as i hope i shall always do for the time to come  bills being found at hicks hall against the three murderers of mr thynn as principal and against the count as accessory they the next day made their appearance at the old baily where after a trial which lasted from nine in the morning to five in the afternoon and a very vigorous prosecution on the part of mr thynns relations the three were brought in guilty as principals and the count by the same jury acquitted as not accessory it being per medietatem linguae according to the privilege of strangers i was the first that carried the news of this to the king who seemed to be not at all displeased at it but the duke of monmouths party who all appeared to add weight to the prosecution were extremely dissatisfied that the count had so escaped  thynn were pursuant to their sentence hanged in the street where they had perpetrated the crime the captain died without any the least symptom of fear or offering at the least glance of reflection on count coningsmark and seeing me in my coach as he passed by in the cart he made a bow to me with the most steady countenance as he did to several of the spectators he knew before  having thus concluded the history of this remarkable transaction i shall only by the way observe that i was soon after appointed governor of york in opposition to a strong hallifax who continued steady for a parliament and expressed himself of opinion that the duke had gained no great ascendant over the king by his late journey into england from whence he was now upon his return to scotland a journey quite disagreeable even to the kings own friends and indeed he was chiefly persuaded to it by his servants who gained by his being here  the next day came news that his highness had been in great danger of being cast away in his voyage back to the north the ship he was in having struck upon yarmouth sands and that a great number of the passengers had been lost a piece of news that was at first contradicted but in that the gloucester a third rate in which the duke of york had embarked for scotland had actually suffered shipwreck upon one of yarmouth sands called the lemon and oar and that the duke with about an   0 persons were saved among those that perished were the lords o brian and roxborough and mr hyde lord clarendons brother  hallifax he told me that the day before being sunday the duke of monmouth came to him after prayers and asked him if it was true that his lordship as was reported had advised the king in council to issue out a proclamation to forbid every body from keeping him company and that he had answered that he was not obliged to satisfy him whether he had so advised his majesty or not and that the duke replied there would be no need of a proclamation to prevent him from keeping his lordship company and that in another place he would have said more to him and so went away  it must be by all confessed that his grace in this acted a very imprudent part for he must needs have known that his thus questioning a privy councellor concerning advice given by him at the board would sound very harsh to the king and on the other hand if his intentions were really for a quarrel he might have chosen a more proper place and have said more or nothing at all i offered to serve his lordship with my life upon this occasion but he was so very good as to say that if it came to a necessity of that sort he would make use of somebody he did not esteem so much as he did me but that however he did not think himself obliged to fight upon that account though he should ever be ready to defend himself while he wore a sword by his side  the next day a council was held at hampton court where as soon as it was up his lordship told me an order had been passed to this effect that whereas the duke of monmouth had been guilty of some threatening speeches to a member of that board in relation to something offered to his majesty in council his majesty considered the same as an unmannerly insolence toward himself and did therefore charge all his servants and all such as had dependence on him not to keep company with or frequent the said duke of monmouth for the time to come  i had soon after a conference with lord hallifax wherein i observed to him that  and now i retired to my government of york where though many transactions were pretty remarkable they are of too private and particular a nature to be here enumerated i shall therefore only observe that the city of york had been more noted than most places in england for the height and virulence of faction but that after i had been there some time finding some of the leaders willing to abate of their warmth i engaged myself in some private discourse with mr alderman ramsden one of the most extraordinary of the whole fraternity and so well explained to him the danger they were in if they did not show some speedy signs of remorse and repentance for their former behavior that he confessed himself sensible of errors committed upon several occasions viz in that they had so often persisted in their choice of such members as they knew to be quite ungrateful to the king in that they had so handsomely received the duke of york when he passed through their city in his way to scotland and in that they had petitioned for a parliament but never addressed or abhorred but that after all he was afraid their offenses were too enormous to be pardoned upon a consideration less than the surrender of their charter which they did not know how to think of i then asked him what he thought the city might be persuaded to do by way of some atonement to which he answered they might be brought to do three things if they might be accepted first to lay aside alderman thompson a peevish antimonarchial fellow to whom it fell of course to be lord mayor the next year provided his majesty would by letter command them so to do secondly to choose a new high steward and to offer the honor to his royal highness in lieu of the duke of buckingham whom they would put out or in case his highness should refuse it to his lordship of hallifax and thirdly to elect better members for that city when occasion should offer these three things he said were feasible might they be thought sufficient  hallifax who in a few days sent me for answer that though he approved of the setting aside of thompson from being lord mayor he could by no means think it safe to venture the kings letter upon it to the corporation except the success of the attempt were actually certain and especially as things were in so very fair a way above particularly with regard to the quo warranto against the city charter which if it succeeded every other corporation would be obliged to truckle and that should the kings letter meet with the proposed effect it would rebound back again upon the court and be an encouragement to the other party that as for their choosing his highness to be their high steward he judged it improper and unfit upon many accounts and as forhimself he was willing to put himself upon the issue of what they proposed provided it did not seem to be his own request and that it should appear he had a considerable number of friends and wellwishers therein though the event itself should not answer such was the substance of what he returned  london where he had some things hyde now earl of rochester and first lord commissioner of the treasury his lordship had informed the king of  0000 l of his hearthmoney which had been misapplied to some private use or uses lord rochester could not but know of and was much suspected to share in together with some miscarriages and mismanagement of the revenue which it seems no body but his lordship had the courage to expose to the king he told me also he had lately brought in lord sunderland to be secretary of state by engaging the duke of york in his behalf and that now his highness seemed to be kinder to that lord who had labored all he could against him in the late parliaments than to himself who had done all he could to serve him and who had particularly made the most considerable head against the bill of exclusion and touched upon some hard returns and disappointments of the same kind from the same quarter but still his lordship was well with the king it was in no degree in their power to remove him though they combined their whole strength to effect it and indeed i had reason to know how large an influence he had over his majesty for to him it was wholly owing that i sat still in my government of york  a few days afterward his lordship told me of some hard usage he had met with from lord rochester contrary to their mutual engagements in favor of each other upon his first entering into business and that having obtained a promise to be lord president or lord privy seal as a vacancy of either should first fall out which happened to be of the seal lord rochester had behind the curtain done all in his power for mr seymour that upon this occasion he had been raised to the dignity of marquess which he had never desired with a view to make him amends for the seal but that not declining the one or the other he had obtained both and that thereupon seymour had left the court that however the king commanding it he was willing to be upon good terms with his lordship but that he must give him some sufficient assurance that he was more a friend to him than to sunderland ere he could repose any degree of confidence in him that in the mean time he would keep in his corner and be attentive to whatever might be for the kings service and not be afraid to acquaint his majesty with what might be for his majestys disadvantage whoever were the actors or transactors and in fine that when he had power he should be careful to distinguish those who were his friends from those who were not so  now the affair of the forty thousand pounds said to have been lost to the king upon his hearthmoney and charged upon lord rochester and the other lords commissioners of the treasury came to be argued by counsel on both sides before the king and it plainly appeared that the king was actually so much a loser but such was the interest that lord rochester supported as he was by the duke of york duchess of portsmouth and lord sunderland had with his majesty that little or no notice of the fraud was taken at that time except of some of that lords friends having taken the liberty to censure lord hallifax as too busy in making the discovery the king justified him so far as to say openly that day in court upon the trial that his lordship had done nothing in the whole affair but by his order and approbation my lord hallifax told me this was not the only matter that would appear as to the ill management of the royal revenue and observed that the anticourt party courted him at such a rate that he feared it might create a jealousy elsewhere  a few days afterward his lordship told me the duke made it his business to clear himself from having had any concern on either side for the fraud on the one hand and the discovery on the other were the general talk of the town but that his highness should apply to him before he would apply to his highness he told me also that he had the day before been with the king and that he was two hours in private with him and that he had observed to his majesty that a report was spread as if lord rochester was to have the lord high treasurers staff delivered to him but that he was in hopes there was no such intention for that it would be a great reflection upon himself and look as if his majesty thought he had done wrong to the man whom he immediately so favored and that his majesty should say the man should not be lord treasurer the sooner for what he had lately done as lord rochester and that his majesty was angry with him for giving ear to so groundless a rumor  hallifax told me the duke had assured him he was not in the least concerned in the difference between him and lord rochester and that he had replied he was sure his highness could wish him no ill and that if he did he should never do any thing to oppose him but that in such a case he should not be able to serve him with that zeal he could with and that his highness might possibly repent he had lost his service to the degree he desired to use it for him that he had done no more than he had been by the king commanded to do and that there was no man in the kingdom so great that he could be decently displeased with what was done at the kings command that he perceived they meaning rochester had a mind to rid their hands of him and that it was likely they might endeavor to make him uneasy in his station but that he would take care they should not remove him first because he would stay with the king to be ready to serve him and secondly because he had a mind to disappoint those who so earnestly longed for his absence that his whole view had been to save the king money and that he knew no greater service that could be done to his highness if he would but be pleased to look a little before him into futurity that the king indeed had made him a greater man than he deserved to be but that he had this to say for himself he was a gentleman and that his highness ought in justice to have some consideration for those that bore escutcheons as well as for those that had none some of the dukes creatures were scarce gentlemen and that for his part he should never say any thing to his highness but truth which though at first sight it might look a little plain and homely nothing at the bottom carried with it a greater fund of respect and much more to the same effect that to this his highness made answer that what his lordship had said seemed to be very rational that he was sensible of great obligations he had to him and that he never would forget them but serve him in all he was able and that so his lordship should find  his lordship also told me the same day that he had been with my lady duchess of portsmouth and that among other discourse he told her he found that in case he should stand in need of his majestys favor he was not to expect many friends on that side of whitehall and that she made answer that some who had been very much his friends meaning rochester came thither sometimes and that she hoped they would be as much his friends again that to this he replied he was in much doubt as to her intercession and good offices in such a strait but hoped he should avoid the danger of making use thereof and took notice that she thereupon blushed and seemed to be in some confusion his lordship further said that were he quite as young as he had been he might be as well with her as others but upon this i observed that his lordship ought to have been furnished with a good purse as well as something else that began with the same letter for so report said lord danby kept intelligence so long and so great with her  the court and the whole town were infinitely divided as to the dispute between the two lords those who had any dependence on payments out of the exchequer durst not but be on the side of lord rochester but all sober and serious persons who were independent and wished well to the government applauded the integrity the zeal and the courage of the lord privy seal who would not see so great a sum of the kings money misapplyed and was so honestly bold as to complain though he was sure he should thereby raise a number of violent enemies against him and particularly the whigs as they now called the anticourt party were lavish of their commendations not only on account of the discovery but in hopes this great man might by this quarrel be brought to a cooler degree of moderation  hungary having called in the turk to assist them against the emperor and one or two excepted all the princes of the empire and the kings of spain and sweden preparing to defend the empire against the turk on the one hand and the french king likely to fall upon flanders or some of the princes of germany on the other while we sat at ease amidst the blessings and plenty of a peace which it was thought would be lasting because of the death of the busy and factious shaftsbury not long before retired into holland  going with my lord privy seal to take the air in hyde park he told me he hoped i was sorry he pressed me to come up to london seeing i could not so well have been made acquainted with the state of affairs at such a distance as york that it was uncertain how long he should be able to keep his station driven at so fiercely as he was by some but that he imagined he had the king to his friend and could not conceive he would part with him for no other fault than the having obeyed his commands but says he if we fall again under the influence of french councils i shall fairly quit there being greater endeavors against me on the other side of the water than on this and desired me when i got into the country again to turn the report of his disgrace into raillery till he should give me notice of his retreat which he would early do if he found it unavoidable  two days afterward i went to see lord danby in the tower and found him to express himself much more obligingly toward lord privy seal than he had been used to do heretofore among other things he said his lordship had taken a prudent and becoming course in declaring himself for a parliament and that he was very glad of it upon a private account for that he despaired of being enlarged till there was a sitting he said lord rochester and his party might support themselves for a while but that the interest they built upon was no better than a sandy foundation  the next day i communicated this to lord hallifax who on his part seemed also to be more favorably inclined toward lord danby than he had for some time been he said he had already enemies enough and that what he had to say against that lord was now out of his mind but that however he would not now make himself enemies by being his friend as he had formerly done by being otherwise so that i found lord privy seal was making up his interest on the one hand as lord rochester was on the other for the latter had sent for seymour to court and promised to be his friend lord privy seal told me that seymour had made some advances to close with him and that a general reconciliation was endeavoring on the part of rochesters friends i told his lordship that in my poor opinion he had much better stand by himself now that he had possessed himself of the interest of the nation by the means of what he had done in opposition to lord rochester that if he closed in with that side again he might run the hazard of losing the good opinion of his country which he now so deservedly enjoyed whereas if he kept himself separate he might be master of both the one and the other and that set the case he should fall the king would soon be sensible of such a want of him that he could not long be spared from court to this his lordship replied it would be matter of great difficulty for him to stay there with men whose interest it was to remove him that they would be apt to play him tricks knowing that while he was in any play their carriage and conduct would be no secrets to his majesty but that if they did engross the king all to themselves they would not long keep their hold for that the king had one quality which would always preserve him from being long in ill hands meaning his facility to hear all persons and to admit of all informations from a backdoor while the favorites did not in the least dream of such his atttention his lordship then lamented the prodigious influence the duchess of portsmouth had over the king complaining that she betrayed him not in his councils only but his bed also and that she certainly lay with the grand prior of france who often came over under the mask of love the better and more effectually to transmit intelligence and information to his master the french king he urged it that the king was too passive with regard to these things and observed it as his greatest fault that no argument could prevail on him to resent what he clearly saw he ought to resent and that he descended too low srom the sublime elevation of his dignity his lordship then took notice that i also in my station was the subject of much envy and advised me when i returned again into the country to demean my self so as to gain as great a measure of favor and benevolence as i decently could  upon the whole i perceived that the lord privy seal had the better and more approved cause and that the lord rochester had the more potent and overuling interest that the lord privy seal deservedly weighed with the body of the nation and that the lord rochester weighed though undeservedly enough only with the duke of york the duchess of portsmouth my lord of ormond and others at court who depended upon his majestys purse which labored the distribution of lord rochester in short the fear was that the diligence of those so near the king might prevail on him to abandon the lord privy seal who depended upon himself only upon no interest but his own and upon the merit which was certainly great of the important services he had already done and was best able for the future to do for the crown and here we put a period to this year  york and heard that richmond to be their high steward which i was not sorry to understand as their affairs then stood my lord privy seal having declined that honor for the sake of the duke of buckingham who was to be put out before another could be admitted the duchess took this very kindly and upon receiving the patent for that office which the city presented to the young duke in a gold box her grace sent my lord mayor a letter of thanks wherein she said the king was very well pleased that the second city in england had had that regard for her son and assured him and the corporation of her utmost services but the duke of buckingham took it extremely ill of them on the other hand and wrote them such a letter as might easily convince them of it the duke of buckingham being well with the lord privy seal i was at some loss to know how to steer between the divided interests but i hope i did it in such a manner as to give offense to neither  june following we were alarmed with a report of a dangerous conspiracy against the king of such as had been disappointed of preferments at court and of protestant dissenters the same conspiracy was also against the duke of york and the design was to have shot both his majesty and his highness as they came from newmarket the day of their return being fixed this was to have been executed by forty men who the blow given were to have scoured to london and to have reported it to have been done by the papists in london it was said there were a body of men ready to rise and to take immediate possession of the city and tower and consequently of the whole nation and that the duke of monmouth was ready to head the insurrection  this was miraculously defeated by a fire which burned down a great part of the town of newmarket and caused the kings departure from thence ten days sooner than was at first intended the design thus frustrated it was afterward renewed to kill the two royal brothers as they came from hampton court but the king being alone they postponed it their view being to destroy both or neither these and the like disappointments put it into the head of one of the melancholy conspirators that god to use his own phrase was against them which wrought on him to disclose the whole affair and he accordingly did upon this many of the conspirators and abettors withdrew the duke of monmouth fled lord gray made his escape after he had been taken but sir thomas armstrong was apprehended and committed to the tower together with the earl of essex the lord howard of eskrick lord russel and many others and orders were sent down to us in the north to keep a watchful eye and a ready hand over all suspicious persons and particularly to look out for one mr goodenough and one mr nelthorp who were supposed to have made their way toward us by some scotchmen we intercepted and examined we understood this conspiracy to have been general with the fanatics and discontented in both kingdoms and that the correspondence was carried on between them by the scotch pedlars and other emissaries in disguise which caused great scrutiny and search to be made and observed with regard to all such people from the north but to dwell on the particulars of this plot and the proofs made out against those who suffered for it were needless after what has been said and recorded by many both privately and publicly concerning it so i shall only say that in the conclusion it proved fatal to lord russel the eldest son and heir to the earl of bedford and others of more inferior note  turk and now more than ever under the apprehensions of such a catastrophe the common enemy having for some time laid close siege to vienna and reduced that capital to great extremities but at length it was relieved by the fortunate valor of the king of poland assisted principally by the duke of lorrain the emperors general and partly by the electors of saxony and bavaria but the bare mention of this being as much as can be required at my hands i shall return to the posture and current of our own affairs  in october i had a letter from my lord hallifax to acquaint me that i had the kings leave to come to town which i had desired as thinking it to be necessary i should be near the kings person at a time when i thought he would be taking of new measures and making of new regulations with regard to affairs in general and officersin particular for his own and the nations greater security after the late horrid machinations accordingly i sat out the latter end of this month for london where i arrived in november  i went to visit my lord privy seal and found him still rooted in the kings good esteem but that the duke was not altogether so grateful to him as he ought to have been i found also that the differences between his lordship and lord rochester not only subsisted still but with more acrimony and warmth than before and understood that the lord mayor of york was sent for up by an order of council on account of some words he had spoken the king received me very graciously and the duke seemed kind to me nor did my lord rochester whom i visited scruple to favor me with a decent reception  but i found the hopes of a parliament to be still at a very great distance though flanders was in danger of falling next spring under the yoke of france and though the nation was much dissatisfied at the tedious delay that part of the nation i mean that was in opposition to the french interest and just now it happened that the grand prior of france being in england and observed to be very fond of the duchess of portsmouth and she of him the king conceived so great a jealousy thereat he sent him away and it was shrewdly suspected the duchess would not be long behind him which few people seemed to be very sorry for  i had heard from a great man that something would shortly happen very much to the mortification of the duke of york and his party a mystery which seemed in a few days afterward to be explained the duke of monmouth being suspected to have taken refuge somewhere abroad on account of the conspiracy surrenders himself to mr secretary jenkins at whitehall where the thing being before concerted the king and duke went to him and after an hours discourse suffered him to go to his lodgings at the cockpit attended by his own servants and under no other restraint than that of a sergeant at arms but what was said or done at this interview may be conjectured sooner than known  this was matter of surprise to all people and waiting on lord privy seal he told me he doubted not but the duke of monmouths affair his grace having that day kissed the kings hand the dukes and the queens would be the subject of great speculation and that various guesses would be made as to the intercession that brought it to pass i told him the world said the duchess of portsmouth and lord sunderland had done it and that it was publicly known that the king had the day before in council said it was at the request of the duke of york to whom his grace had made submission and disclaimed all competition with for the crown his lordship answered that the thing was far from so for that the duke of york and those in his interest had opposed it to the very last and thereupon owned himself to have been chiefly instrumental therein and gave me several reasons both public and private though not proper to be here enumerated why he labored to that end by this it plainly appeared to me that notwithstanding the extraordinary strength of the interest combined against him this noble lord had great power with his majesty his lordship moreover gave me to understand that his grace had made confession of the late plot but would not give any public evidence against the conspirators but to dismiss this certain it is that whoever wrought so industriously with the king in favor of the duke of monmouth his majesty himself may be said to have had a large share therein he had a paternal affection for him nor could refrain from the most open and public expressions of it wherever he saw him and the duke on his part paid all the respect and duty imaginable in attending upon and following the king mean while york seemed outwardly to agree to the duke of monmouths readmission it was by no means an act of choice but of necessity the king having declared he would have it so and that he was not made privy to it above two days before it was effected  the king had now conceived a displeasure york and coming from the duchess of portsmouths he asked me leaning upon my arm if i knew sufficient matter for bringing a quo warranto against their charter i told his majesty i did not but would endeavor to inform my self but feared i could not so well do it at such a distance as if i was upon the spot to which his majesty replied i only recommend it to you the lord mayor it seems had refused to let a mountebank erect his stage in that city though he was furnished with the kings recommendation which the man complaining of his majesty thought himself thereby slighted or injured  york being arrived came to desire leave to make use of my name before the council so far as to say the governor knew how ready he was with his assistance upon occasion of the late plot to which i gave my consent i well knew that the duke of york who thought him accessory to his once ill reception in that city wished in his heart the man might be punished but i imagined i could not but in justice stand by him in what was right and that i could not do amiss in carrying him to my lord privy seal who gave him his promise to assist him at the board i knew there was pique and malice in the complaint against him and was in hopes it might be a means of making him a thorough convert if he was but mercifully handled in this troublesome matter  being the next day at lady portsmouths the king told me there was fresh complaint against the lord mayor of york and that he was afraid he was but a bad man i said i was obliged to acquaint his majesty with this truth that he was very ready to give me his assistance in york upon the late dreadful occasion but that i could say nothing in defense of what he might have committed since i left the place to have done with this  monmouth having obtained his pardon refused to sign a public declaration of his knowledge of the late conspiracy against the king for which he was ordered to keep from whitehall my lord privy seal told me the manner of doing this as required was something hard but that his grace ought entirely to have submitted himself to the kings pleasure his lordship i found was much concerned that the duke had been so obstinate and he had reason to be so being now deemed as he was the chief instrument that brought him into favor the algernon sydney was executed upon tower hill as one of the conspirators but said nothing before he suffered he only left a paper with the sheriff which i heard the king say was very treasonable and evasive though not wholly negative of the fact laid to his charge but however it was not thought proper to be printed and now i found that the duke of york was not at all pleased with the lord privy seal though he made open show of the contrary for that he was not consulted on the restoration of the duke of monmouth and it was his lordships own expression that the duke would never forgive it him but the king having been the chief promoter of it it did not appear that his lordship had lost any ground with him the duke of monmouth would not perform what was expected of him and how could his lordship help it  the confederates spain holland sweden and the rest who were now preparing to resist the french and to preserve flanders were very angry with us for that we still supinely persisted in our neutrality and particularly the spaniard who said it was a breach of our league with him but all remonstrances of this sort were to none effect our king pretended his own affairs were in so ill a posture at home that he could not so much as think of involving himself in a war which confirmed the jealousy of our adhering to the french interest and of a private commerce kept up with them by the intervention of the duchess of portsmouth and others  albemarle who told me he was sorry to find that lord privy seal purely to out do his antagonist rochester should have had so great a hand in bringing in monmouth and thereby have incurred the duke of yorks displeasure as well as the dislike of a great number of the loyalists who were before his friends that not many hours before the duke had told him that if the lord privy seal had had no friendship for him in any other capacity yet as being the kings brother he might have let him into the secret and not have brought in monmouth quite without his privity that indeed he never could forget what the lord privy seal had formerly done to serve him but that he took a way if possible to make him forget it and that to his knowledge his lordship was still exerting his labors to reunite the king and monmouth the duke of albemarle then observed that his highness knew his relation to the lord privy seal but that the loyalty and respect he bore to his highness was more considered by him than all that and that he hoped his lordship designed him no disservice in this affair with much more to the same purpose in short his grace seemed much to lament what his lordship had done in favor of monmouth his grace added that if the privy seal would but trust him he would tell him how to be too hard for rochester without recurring to such unpopular methods  that he thereby perceived the duke had a mind to be upon better measures with him but that absolutely he had not seen the duke of monmouth since he last left the court that as to what he had done for his grace it was purely in obedience to the kings commands and that as the king would not allow him it was impossible for him to have disclosed the matter to his highness and concluded that he was to dine with the duke of albemarle the wednesday following and should the better know what to say to his grace if he touched upon this affair since i had taken care to apprize him of his thoughts  i learnt from a great man that we were in no way of having a parliament there being some near the king who advised him to another way of ruling the kingdom the same gentleman at the same time lamented that now the fanatics had nothing else to say against the government they must have sufficient cause of complaint upon this account as well as on account of several other points now in agitation some days afterward my lord privy seal told me he had been very earnest with the king to call a parliament and had represented to him that though he had slipped the opportunity of calling one immediately after the late plot when he could not possibly have failed of one according to his mind and might fear he should meet with no good one now he would do well to consider that the longer he deferred the thing the worse it would be and indeed so very bad that it might be used as an argument never to call one more that nothing ought to have that weight with him as his word given to the people that the law required a parliament to be called every three year and that upon the last dissolution his majesty had promised a religious observance of the laws by a proclamation setting forth his reasons for dismissing that parliament that the general construction put upon this was that he intended to call another within the three years and that he feared an ill use might be made of his not doing what it was so generally supposed he certainly would that though the antimonarchists were now at a very low ebb and under great discouragements such his majestys procedure might raise a spirit of discontent where it was least expected meaning among those who though they were friends to the crown were at the same time desirous he should govern according to law and not only desired but expected it since he had given his royal word that he would do so that if however his majesty thought not well of this he would be nevertheless so far from relinquishing his service that he would make it his study to find out excuses to make him easy with the people so then there was no possibility of seeing a parliament assembled but by some compulsion from a foreign cause and no body could tell but that if the war went on the confederates might be provoked to declare against us  in short affairs were now chiefly under the management of the duke of york who carried every thing with a very lofty hand but what is very strange the earl of danby was on the point of stepping out of the tower though against his highnesss consent my lord privy seal assured me his enlargement was at hand that he himself had been his lordships chief friend and that the king had made both the duke and lord rochester seemingly set their hands to it the duke indeed appeared to be hearty in it and that the king was so there could be no doubt but rochester and sunderland did underhand oppose it with might and main and so contrived that the judges delayed to bail out his lordship till the very last day of the term those two lords dreading that danby might join with hallifax to weaken  and now it was resolved to bring a quo warranto if with any color of justice it could be done against the charter of york and two days afterward lord danby was bailed out of his long confinement of five years as were all the popish lords that had been under durance ever since the time of the first plot lord danby came the same day to kiss his majestys hand in the bedchamber where i happened to be present the king received him very kindly and when the earl complained of his long imprisonment his majesty told him he knew it was against his consent which his lordship thankfully acknowledged but they had no manner of private discourse together my lord privy seal came into the presence presently after and the two lords saluted each other but it was very slightly done on both sides the next day however i went from the lord privy seal to wait upon the earl when his lordship desired me to present his service to him and to tell him that he should have taken a more particular sort of notice of him but that he thought it would not prove so much for his service and the earl said it was for the very self same reason he had behaved so indifferently toward his lordship for there was at that time great jealousy of a friendship between them lord danby told me he would retire to his house out of town nor concern himself with business though he doubted not but he might if he would but not upon the national foundation he desired and therefore would have nothing to do with it declaring his aversion to a french or a popish interest he told me also the substance of what had passed between the duke and him at the visit he made to his highness after he had been with the king and i thereby understood his lordship was upon no very affectionate terms with that prince he said his highness told him he had heard he had spoken slightingly of him and that he answered it was true he had often been so unfortunate as to differ with him in opinion and could not help saying that he had never yet found any cause to repent him of it but that for expressing himself any how against his person if he heard so they were whispers and lies and desired to know who were his informers but the duke evaded that in short i found by my lord privy seal that he and the earl of danby had a good understanding together  the king went to newmarket and i followed portsmouths till bedtime and so to his own apartment to take his rest  french king had offered either a truce or a peace for a certain term of years but then it was upon very hard conditions he refusing to give up any thing he had taken either from spain or the empire so that there was no likelihood that the confederates would agree thereto our king however seconded the french kings offers recommended them to the allies as reasonable and proffered to be guarrantee between them in case they came to a point  rochester continued powerful enough to advance his friends and mr godolphin one of the commissioners of the treasury was made secretary of state instead of sir lyonel jenkins who had leave by reason of his great age to retire a promotion that was not made without the participation of the lady portsmouth the lord privy seal the same day told me that though all these combined interests were still as averse to him as ever the king was nevertheless as kind to him as he had usually been but it was very obvious that his lordship was less in business than before his lordship however had certainly a very large portion of the kings esteem and what he said had generally great weight with his majesty and now the duke of york is declared lord high admiral of england that is he was invested with the power of that office without either the title or the patent because his highness could not dispense with the oaths or the sacrament a circumstance which gave great offense to numbers of people nor must we forget another thing though of a private nature which happened this day for the duchess of portsmouth contrary to custom waiting on the queen at dinner as lady of the bedchamber her majesty was thereby thrown into such disorder that the tears stood in her eyes while the other laughed at it and turned it into a jest  french had possessed themselves of luxemburgh which our court seemed to be not at all displeased with but there were those and some of them the kings best friends who were extremely sorry to hear it that place being reckoned to be the key of germany holland and flanders and probably too opportune to advance the grandeur of the common enemy a few days afterward i went to windsor to congratulate the king upon his birthday the crowd upon this occasion was great but as for gaiety and gallantry there was but little of either especially as to apparel and now the duke of york is declared of the great council commonly called the privy council whence he had been excluded ever since the statute which required the taking of oaths which his highness refusing upon this readmission it became the subject of much talk and was deemed to be a breach of one of the most solemn and most explicit acts of parliament  york he told me he doubted not but i should do what became me for his majestys service and that for his own part he depended upon me i assured his highness i should never fail in any part of my trust but begged of him to hearken to no stories that might be told him to my prejudice i told him that every county had its competitors and that it was impossible for me to hope to live without enemies and especially as i had the honor of serving the king preferably to many of equal and some of superior rank who could not but look upon me for that reason with an eye of envy a few days afterward i visited the lord danby who informed me that lord rochester was closing in with the moderate men not i suppose out of any affection for them but to make himself the stronger rival against lord privy seal who was suspected to stand upon a firmer bottom than he and consequently to be better able to stand the shock of a parliament in case the king should be prevailed on to call one but alas parliaments seemed to be no longer thought of and to be quite out of doors for it was lord danbys opinion there was a very strict conjunction between us and france though they had so lately taken luxemburgh and were likely to succeed according to their own wishes  i returned to the north and the august following we had the grateful news that buda had been taken for the emperor by the duke of lorrain as also that a truce was made between the emperor and the king of france which looked as if a general peace was at hand that the christian powers might the better exert themselves against the presumptuous arms of the infidel and what still added to the good aspect of the thing we had advice there had been great alterations made with regard to the grandees at court and that particularly lord rochester had been removed from the head of the treasury board to that of the council in which though he was advanced in honor he was put backward in profit and power it was therefore most evidently what he never sought for and as plain that lord hallifax had brought it to pass thus it was that lord danby now in the country conjectured and it was soon confirmed to me by a letter from my lord marquess himself wherein he made use of these words you may believe i am not at all displeased to see such an adversary removed from the only place that could give him power and advantage and he bears it with so little philosophy that if i had ill nature enough he gives me sufficient occasion to triumph you see i cannot hinder myself from imparting my satisfaction to so good a friend but the wonder was how the finger of my lord privy seal was able to effect this against the shoulder of the duke of york who still continued a friend to rochester as much as ever  i went to visit the duke of newcastle at his castle of nottingham where the duke buckingham had been not long before and giving a long account of affairs above which seemed to intimate as if notwithstanding what had lately happened the french interest was still uppermost at court his grace told me also that buckingham was very angry with the marquess of hallifax for refusing to admit of a private communication with the french ambassador when he offered to bring him to his lordship and that his grace should say his power would never be considerable while he continued averse to that interest but in contradiction to this i toward the latter end of this same month received a very kind letter from my lord marquess and others from very great persons which gave me to understand there would probably be some farther change at court that his lordship stood very firm with the king and that it was believed the power of the french interest was somewhat abated  quo warranto which had so long threatened them was served upon the city of york and the resolution thereupon was to send up the charter and to offer at no defense against the king i endeavored as much as i conveniently could to appear quite indifferent on either side but almost upon the back of this i had the sad news from the earl of burlington that his majesty february with a fit of an apoplexy though they called it an epilepsy and that he had continued as it were dead almost three hours till he was brought to himself again by bleeding cupping vomiting and several other means that had been used his lordship farthermore in his letter ordered me so to dispose of things as might best prevent disturbances and troubles in case his majesty should unfortunately suffer a relapse and all the necessary precautions were taken accordingly though upon the news that the king was recovered and in some way of continuance there was nothing but bonfires and rejoycings in our parts a short lived mirth for three days afterward we had news that his majesty was fallen into a relapse and that his physicians were in great fear he could not recover at this we doubled our diligence to secure peace and quietness and to prevent any obstacle that might start up in prejudice to the duke of york two days afterward came news which they had orders together with myself from the privy council and the secretary of state to proceed immediately and proclaim james the second as soon as we had got every thing ready for this ceremony which we had before day i gave leave for the delivery of the rest of the letters and by seven in the morning the high sheriff met by the archbishop and most of the gentlemen in the town moved toward the castleyard to proclaim the king there while i caused all the garrison the necessary guards excepted to be drawn together in the thursday market  first did it in the usual places in the city the second did it in the castleyard for the county and i did it in the thursday market to the garrison there drawn out together i then ordered a double discharge of the artillery and several vollies according to the orders i had for that end received from my lord sunderland all this was transacted with all imaginable tokens of peace and joy not only in york but afterward throughout the whole county and indeed the whole kingdom  a strange effect of power it was from heaven it self that so strong a party as had reared its head in parliament and so pertinaciously called out for the exclusion of the duke of york should now upon his accession acquiesce to him with such deference and quiet submission but it may be presumed they were aware of the difference there was between the spirit of the late and the present king the former they thought might for peace sake be sooner brought to abandon his brother than the latter tamely to renounce his right and title to three kingdoms for fear of a war but what served in very great measure to quiet the minds and allay the passions of men was king jamess declaration to the privy council immediately after the breath was out of his brothers body whereby he promised to defend the government of england both in church and state and carefully to tread in the footsteps of his late majesty with regard to his kindness and lenity toward his people and that as on the one hand he would defend the just rights and prerogatives of the crown so on the other he would invade no mans property  i stayed at york a few days to keep the peace and in the mean time had notice from the proper hands that i was continued in my command and that i had leave to set out for london as i indeed had desired rochester was made lord high treasurer of england lord privy seal was made lord president of the council which though it was a step higher as to place it was much doubted that it was not at his lordships desire the trust and profit of the privy seal being judged to be an overbalance for the honor of the other and now we had the agreeable prospect of of a parliament which it was said his majesty intended should meet in may next  it was now beyond all doubt that the whitehall to be kept in statu quo whither the princess of denmark repaired daily while the king did the same to the queens private chapel in the interim i was chosen a member to sit in the ensuing parliament for the city of york and with this new charge i this day sat forward for london where being arrived my lord marquess of hallifax told me he and lord rochester the treasurer were now very well together that he had used his constant endeavors to serve the king and that he would continue to do the same but that he hoped his majesty would not think of imposing his religion on him which he seemed sorrowfully to apprehend the most considerable posts in the army in ireland being now put into the hands of papists his lordship then recalled to me several instances of the late kings kindness to him and certainly no man was deeper in his favor when his majesty was unfortunately snatched away than my lord marquess a few york who had petitioned me for leave to exercise themselves at arms on certain days of the year which the king received very kindly  the next day my lord hallifax told me he had had two private audiences of the king and that he had in such plain terms told him his mind upon the grand point of government that he much wondered the king considering his natural temper took it with that calmness and composure he did his lordship then observed it possibly might be insisted on that some acts should in the ensuing parliament be repealed which would require a weighty and mature deliberation and touched on some things not altogether so fit to be inserted in this place  westminsterabbey with all imaginable pomp and magnificence except that there was no cavalcade thorough the city as the custom had formerly been  their majestys went privately to the palace at westminster where they the nobility and all the officers of the crown put on their robes formalities and ensigns and thence proceeded thorough palaceyard railed in and prepared for that purpose in procession to westminsterabbey whence the ceremony being completed they all returned to the hall to a most sumptuous dinner and now the gentlemen of the house of commons began to consider what the court might demand of them as well as what might be granted at the approaching session the parliament consisting of a great number of loyal gentlemen who were nevertheless good patriots and true protestants the report went that there would be more required in behalf of popery than the laws now in force would allow of and that the king expected the settlement of a constant revenue upon him suitable to that of the late king besides a sum of ready money to subvene his preseut occasions that in favor of popery it would be proposed to repeal the habeas corpus act which i found was much opposed by some great ones in their private discourse as well as by some of us and to enact a general toleration or liberty of conscience which some seemed willing enough to subscribe to though at the same time the resolution was to admit of no alteration to capacitate papists to enjoy any place or employment in or under the government as for the affair of money men in general seemed willing to settle an handsome revenue upon the king and to give him money but whether their grant should be permanent or only temporary and to be renewed from time to time by parliament that the nation might be the oftener consulted was the question in all this i resolved punctually to do my duty to the crown but not to be unmindful of a due regard for my country and my religion  hilliard sir roger martin and other gentlemen of great consideration with the popish party they told me the king would expect a repeal of the sanguinary laws that the papists should be allowed the private exercise of their religion and that they at least such as had served the royal family in the wars or otherwise should be capable of employment under him that the king would in parliament give full satisfaction to the nation with regard to their religion and properties but that if reason would not serve his purpose he knew what he had to do that the king would never divide the regal power by admitting of that of the pope that his majesty was too fond of power to be guilty of that oversight and that his adhering to the defense of the church of england would on the other hand deter the pope from pressing him to admit of his supremacy in short that it was but reasonable the king should insist on the repeal of the severer penal laws against the papists for that if he should die he would leave them in as ill a plight as he found them but what wisdom or sense there was in those who at this time could offer at such arguments need not be said  i waited on the king in his barge from whitehall to somerset house where he went to visit the queen dowager it was upon this day that the noted doctor oats was convicted of perjury it being proved that he was at st omers the   th of april      when he swore he was at the whitehorse tavern in the strand where pickering groves ireland and other jesuits signed the death of king charles the second this was a grateful hearing to the king who thereupon observed that indeed there had been a meeting of the jesuits that day and that all the scholars of st omers knew of it but that it was well doctor oats knew no better where it was to be for says his majesty they met in st jamess where i then lived which if oats had but known he would have cut out a fine spot of work for me the king then subjoined that oats being thus convicted the popish plot was now dead to which i answering that it had been long since dead and that now it would be buried his majesty so well approved of the turn that going with him afterward to the princess of denmarks i heard him repeat it to her  three or four days afterward we had advice that a store of arms had been bought up in holland and conveyed into scotland and that lord argyle lord gray and some said the duke of monmouth were actually gone with them or after them  mean while the parliament assembled in the westminster but did nothing this day but take the oaths and choose their speaker sir john trevor who was confirmed by the king the two next days were also taken up in swearing the members and taking the test on the twenty second the king made a speech to both houses and therein assured them he would support and defend the church of england whose members had ever been most loyal in the worst of times in the cause of his father and the support of his brother as also to adhere to the government both in church and state as by law established and that as he never would depart from the just rights and prerogatives of the crown so neither would he attempt to invade any mans property he desired of us suitable returns in settling the revenue on him for life as in the days of the late king and concluded with an account he had received from scotland that the earl of argyle was landed with men and arms on the western islands of that kingdom and that the said lord had published two declarations in both of which he charged him with tyranny and usurpation  the commons returning to their house immediately voted that the kings speech should be taken into speedy consideration and were so well pleased with the solemn security the king had given them as to their religion and property that they voted him the very same revenue for his life as had been enjoyed by the late king for hi they then voted that the king should by the whole house in a body be thanked for his speech in which the lords concurred and it was accordingly done the next day when they farthermore voted an address to his majesty assuring him they would stand by him with their lives and fortunes against argyle his abettors and all other traitors whatsoever which being presented accordingly to the king he was pleased to answer that he expected no less from a parliament so happily made up of monarchical and churchofenglandmen and that he should fear no enemy he either had or might have while he had them on his side and now all things seemed to smile with a very auspicious countenance the king forbearing the least advances toward a change of religion and seeming to be bent quite the contrary way  in the midst of this a motion was made england as by law established as also to present an address to the king to issue out his royal proclamation for putting the laws in execution against all dissenters of what denomination soever and these votes though in a very full committee passed nemine contradicente  king who had so solemnly declared his intentions to defend our religion that the king had told us the way to keep a good understanding between him and his parliament would be to use him well and that he could not but take this amiss and finally that it might be an encouragement to the rebels already in arms in the kingdom of scotland and so on to this it was answered that it would have but an indifferent look with the nation if we being members of the church of england should let such commendable votes in favor of our religion drop unheeded at length the previous question being put whether to agree or not to agree with the committee it was carried in the negative the whole matter then was summed up in this vote that an address should be made to the king purporting that the house did entirely rely on his royal declaration that he would defend and secure the reformed religion of the church of england as by law established by far dearer and nearer to them than their lives  argyle had penetrated into his own territories in the north of scotland with a body of  000 men and that he was fortifying himself scotland he then recommended the navy to us as the strength and glory of the nation assuring us he had a true english heart jealous of the honor of the nation and that he pleased himself with the thoughts by gods blessing and their assistance to raise the reputation of it in the world higher than it had ever yet been in the days of any of his ancestors  lyme in dorsetshire that the duke of monmouth was landed in that neighborhood with arms for  0000 men together with officers and soldiers to the number of about  00 that many of the people flocked in to him from that factious country and that he had declared himself the protector of the protestant religion against popery with all speed then the king sent down the duke of albemarle the lord lieutenant of that part to raise the militia and after him some companies of the standing foot and six troops of horse and dragoons lyme is naturally a safe and advantageous post and was in monmouths power so that in two or three days more we heard he was  00 strong but at the same time that the duke of albemarle had raised the militia and was marching toward him with some  000 men  the king no sooner heard that monmouth was landed as we have said than he communicated the same to the commons upon which they immediately voted him their thanks and resolved in a body of the whole house to wait on his majesty with their own address wherein they promised to stand by him with their lives and fortunes against that ungrateful rebel james duke of monmouth and all others whosoever they might be such were the promising beginnings of this short and memorable reign soon after comes monmouths declaration which the king the next day sent to both houses who attended him that very day and voted a reward of  000 l to any body that should take him and bring him to the king dead or alive this declaration charged james duke of york for so it styled the king with the burning of the city the death of sir edmundbury godfrey the murder of sidney and lord russell with the poisoning of the late king and tearing his crown from his head it charged him also with being a slave to popish councils and with packing the present parliament and that therefore he was come to revenge all these things on the pretended king that he would never hearken to any terms or accommodation till his work was completed and that as he was resolved to give no quarter to those that opposed him he exhorted all good people to come in and assist him to this he subjoined that he had a just title to the crown but that he would lay no claim to it till he had called a free parliament to whom he was ready to give full satisfaction as to that matter that parliaments should sit every year nor he dismissed till all grievances were redressed and that he would grant liberty of conscience to all manner of people not excluding even the papists and much more in the same strain  mean while came news that monmouth having marched out of the town of lyme with  00 foot and  00 horse had met with some of the dorsetshire militia fallen on them killed several persons of note and taken some prisoners and now an additional supply is voted for defraying the expense of the war against the duke of monmouth the house upon this occasion resolved it self into a committee of the whole to consider of the ways and means for raising this new supply voted that it shonld be levied upon such new foundations as had been built upon within the compass of the bills of mortality since the year    0 excepting the late general fires in the city of london and borough of southwark secondly that it should be levied only upon the rents of the same houses for the term of one year thirdly upon such foundations as were now laid fourthly that there should be a clause to prevent any more buildings within the said limits fifthly that the house should be moved that a bill might be brought in for that intent in all which the house concurred with the committee  l the sum agreed on the day before and at the same time appointed a committee to enquire into and bring in an estimate of the yearly value of the rents of the new buildings upon new foundations  monmouths forces which were now reported to consist of  000 foot and four troops of horse with which having marched toward taunton a populous and factious town he made himself master thereof two regiments of the militia running away when they heard he was near the place but the duke of albemarle had still orders not to fight till the standing troops had joined him which it was supposed they would do upon the  0th instant on which day also some   00 of the guards horse and foot marched to reinforce the troops that had before been sent to the duke of albemarle commanded by lord feversham the same day the commons understanding it would be a tedious task to levy the necessary sums upon the new foundations proceeded to shift the tax upon french linen brandies callicoes etc  but i cannot help observing that my lord hallifax took it ill of me that i had been so earnest for the taxing of the new buildings he having a deep concern therein but i told him it was my judgment and that if my fathers interest had been ever so much therein i should have done the same thing that however i was very sorry he above all men in the world should disapprove of any thing i did but we prefently understood each other and he said he was very sorry he had said any thing to disturb me this though a transaction of quite a private nature i could not forbear the mention of as it was the only time we ever so much as seemed to differ but to return to matters of more general importance  this day his majesty had advice from scotland that the earl of dunbarton commander in chief of his forces in that kingdom having notice that the rebels had passed the river above dunbarton had marched from glasgow to sterling and overtook them near the close of the day but that in the night the rebels stole away from him into renfrew that the said earl then pursued them with his horse and dragoons and understood that they were making away from him in very great confusion that the same day three servants belonging to a gentleman of renfrew fell upon the earl of argyle as he was getting away in the disguise of a countryman with a blue bonnet on his head and that they had wounded him in several places of the head till at last fearing they would kill him he confessed himself to be the earl of argyle and that thereupon they had taken him prisoner and conducted him to glasgow where he was committed the king sent an account of all this to the commons who returned their thanks for the same by such of their members as were of the privy council who came back with this answer that his majesty was every day more and more satisfied with them for their zeal and loyalty to his person and government and that he gave them his thanks  monmouth had sent a letter to the duke of albemarle under the style and title of his most trusty and wellbeloved cousin and councellor christopher duke of albemarle charging him upon his allegiance to come into his aid and assistance in a word that he now took upon him to be king that he was marched from taunton toward bristol with about  000 men and boys and that albemarle was at his heels  the next day i happened to dine with sir james smith the lord mayor of london whom i had formerly known intimately well and who was of a very loyal club in the city where i used to go while the fanatic plot was in agitation this gentleman complained to me that he enjoyed no more than the bare title of lord mayor the lord chief justice jefferies usurping the power that the city had no sort of intercourse with the king but by the intervention of that lord that whatever was well done in the city was attributed to his influence and management and that himself and the aldermen were by the court looked upon no better than his tools that upon all occasions his lordship was so forgetful of the high dignity of the city as to use him and his brethren with contempt in fine that the lord chief justice was to be pitied that his haughtiness would be the ruin of him and that he actually intended to let the king into the mystery of these things but that he thought the present time was not altogether so proper seeing a remonstrance of this tendency might be construed into mutiny and disaffection i answered that the king was too well acquainted with the lord mayors services and integrity to suspect him of that and that in my opinion now was the fittest time for exposing a man in that credit at court for that now the greatest notice would be taken of all such grievances indeed i was sorry at my heart to see such good men dissatisfied in any degree but i was as glad to find this proud man seen through for he had to my knowledge used the city of york as scurvily as it was possible for him to use the city of london for at york he put out five aldermen though he had solemnly engaged to keep them in and that without so much as allowing them to be heard as to the crimes they stood accused of the lord mayor said the very fame had been frequently practiced in london and that many had been turned out of their employments without so much as being suffered to make their defense in short i was at the very same time told by one of the lieutenancy of the city that should the duke of monmouth give a blow to the kings forces it was much to be feared there would be an insurrection in london  august which was done accordingly and now the fears of those who were friends to the government added to the hopes of those who were averse to it the duke of monmouths army was swelled to a body of   000 foot and   00 horse which moved from place to place in the hilly and enclosed country of the west where though the kings army kept pretty close in with them they could not offer to give battle the kings army that was nearest to monmouth was commanded by lord feversham and did not consist of above  000 foot and five hundred horse but then they were mostly of the guards in a day or two the king had advice that monmouth had got into bridgewater that he intended to fortify himself there whilst he refreshed his army and that lord feversham was close after him  monmouth being then informed that lord feversham lay encamped at not above three miles from bridgewater that his army was as yet but small that he was in expectation of being reinforced by three english and three scotch regiments from holland and that a body of horse was on its march from london to the same purpose he steals out about one in the morning with his whole army and moves toward the royal camp and that with such silence and good order that the kings people knew nothing of the approach till alarmed by the fire of one of their out sentries the duke of monmouth marched at the head of the foot and lord gray led up the horse and they brought their cannon to play within pistolshot on the other hand our people got into order as fast and received them as well as could be expected but were so overpowered by numbers that till lord gray went off with the horse which were frightened at the cannon we were in very imminent danger of losing the day but for the duke of monmouth he stood till a great part of his foot was cut to pieces and then made off but so narrowly that his coat his papers and his secretary were taken ferguson that archpresbyterian priest and rebel and lord gray was taken in disguise three days afterward  the duke of monmouth had from the very beginning of this desperate attempt behaved with the conduct of a great captain as was allowed even by the king who in my hearing said he had not made one false step and thus was this great storm which gathered from a small cloud the number that landed with the duke not exceeding   0 thus i say was this great storm fortunately not to say surprisingly allayed had monmouth obtained a victory it was much to be feared that the disaffected would have risen in such numbers in the several parts of england as to have made the crown horn who being first discovered in a bush told them the duke himself was not far off and the same day the duchess of monmouth and her two sons were sent to the tower the duke when he was taken was almost spent not having been in a bed for three weeks he was quite unprovided with arms nor made any defense being destitute of every thing but a watch he had in his pocket and about three hundred pounds in gold which was all the money he had left his majesty and no wonder was extremely well pleased at this news but he was of a temper so very equal that he never appeared transported upon any occasion and surely he never could have a greater reason for it than now that he saw the rebellion plucked up by the very roots and himself firmer seated on the throne by the endeavors that had been used to shake him out of it  when his grace came to town the king at his own request saw him at whitehall where he expressed some detestation of his attempt threw the blame on the earl of argyle and ferguson who had stirred him up to it disclaiming all title to the crown and said he was put upon assuming the style of king with a view that the quality would the sooner come in to him all this i heard the king say but what he farther confessed was not then known he concluded with a desire of pardon and on his knees begged his life of the king and for the same he by letters solicited the two queens till his head was at five blows severed from his body on tower hill when he came to suffer he submitted with great unconcern renounced all pretense to the crown and unkindly to say no worse disowned his duchess who to him who had nothing of his own had brought a fortune of ten thousand pounds a year saying she was given to him as his wife in the days of his minority but that the wife of his own choice was the lady henrietta wentworth the only daughter and heiress of the earl of cleveland whom he had debauched with whom he confessed he had lived according to the rules of his own convenience though not according to the laws of the land for two years past he then said he was sorry for the effusion of blood he had caused but throughout his whole discourse made no mention of a rebellion and out of his pocket were taken books in his own hand writing containing charms or spells to open the doors of a prison to obviate the danger of being wounded in battle together with songs and prayers such was the latter end of the duke of monmouth  toward the close of this month i returned to my government where nothing occurring of a nature general enough to be worthy of public notice i shall hurry on to the end of october when we had the bad news that my lord marquess of hallifax lord president of the privy council was fallen into disgrace with the king and quite dismissed from the board he had ever been a true and kind patron to me but what was more he was a man of great integrity and most happy talents which made it feared the public might feel the want of him as sensible as his friends but it being the kings pleasure it became all good subjects to submit to it but two or three days afterward being with the archbishop of york and sir henry gooderick they told me it was true the king had laid aside the lord president but that he had assigned no cause for it and expressed some jealousy that the king would offer at something this session in favor of popery  london where i found the house of commons had deferred the consideration of the kings speech on the day of their meeting which was the  th to the   th instant the house of lords had voted their thanks but the commons being moved to the same made head against it as we have hinted the king in this speech told the houses he was glad to meet them in better times than when he parted with them that the rebellion was now perfectly quashed but that however the government might be in like manner attempted for the future it being experienced that the militia of the kingdom was of no use that therefore as the standing force was but small he had raised it to a considerable number which would be an additional charge upon him for the time to come that in consideration thereof he desired a proportionable aid that it was true there were some popish officers in this army but that he hoped it would make no difference between him and his parliament for that though they were not qualified by law they were such as had shown their principles by their loyalty and that having had experience of this he would not expose them to shame by parting with them or to that effect and that in fine he would venture his life for the true interest of the nation  the quantum nor the particular use it was designed for upon this a long debate arose and the question being put they divided the nos being   0 and the ays     they afterward the same day came to a division upon the question whether that house should first proceed upon the supply to the king or upon the second paragraph of his majestys speech concerning the popish officers in the army and it was carried for postponing the supply by one voice only in which division the king was told that several of his servants and officers of the army that were of the house were against him the next day i waited on the king to kiss his hand and immediately of popish recusants into the army was quite contrary to law and to desire that they might be removed from their posts a committee was appointed for this purpose and likewise to frame a bill for the indemnifying the said officers in consideration that they had entered into the service at a time of such imminent danger waiting this day on lord hallifax he told me the particulars of his dismission he said he might have continued with greater advanges than ever if he could but in conscience have concurred in some things which he saw in embryo that the king parted with him with seeming kindness but would assign no cause for it and that he would name no body into his place this lord being generally esteemed a wise man and an excellent subject the removal of him especially in almost the infancy of a parliament was matter of astonishment to great numbers and injected a fear that a change of councils was in consequence to ensue a change of counselors  while those of the court insisted on twelve hundred thousand pounds for the payment of the new raised forces for a term of five years to come but the house would give no ear to such an application of the money they might give lest it should prove a foundation for the support of a standing army they rather chose to give it to the king to do with it as he would and at length seven hundred thousand pounds was proposed and granted in the course of this debate the usefulness of a standing army especially till the ferment of the rebellion was quite settled was much insisted on by the one side while the other exposed the danger of it the infolency of  soldiery the ill example they were of to the country and the heavy burden of free quarters but there was a compromission of all this by the houses declaring its intention to make the militia of more use for the time to come and till then it was agreed on as a thing necessary that the army should be kept on foot  the address against popish officers being prepared was this day read and agreed to but a debate arose whether the concurrence of the lords should be desired or not the courtiers were against it that the king might have the better excuse not to comply with it and the country gentlemen were for that reason for enforcing it the more and upon this occasion i divided with the country but we lost it by some forty voices the next day we considered of the ways and means for raising the seven hundred thousand pounds we had granted and the same day we went in a body with our address to the king who had appointed that to be the time for his receiving it but his answer was that he did not expect such an address from such a house of commons especially as he had so lately offered to our consideration the great advantages of an union between him and us the good effects of which had been already experienced i had said he reason to hope the reputation god has blessed me with in the world might have created and confirmed in you a greater confidence of me and of all i say to you but however you on your part proceed i on mine shall be steady to all the promises i have made and be very just to my word given in every one of my speeches this he uttered with great warmth  service for the future but the debate was adjourned to the   st instant at the same time it was moved by mr wharton eldest son to the lord wharton that a day might be appointed for the consideration of the kings answer to our address which was seconded by mr cook of derbyshire a gentleman of three thousand pounds per annum who was so warm as upon this occasion to say we were all englishmen and that he hoped we should not be frightened from our duty by a few high words but the house resented this as an expression of great indecency and in great anger sending their member to the tower deferred the business sine die  the next day the lords began to consider that part of his majestys speech relating to popish officers and grew very warm in their debate which was adjourned to the   d instant the king happened to be present as he was generally constant in the house of lords and was much concerned at the freedom which they said was used upon this subject and in truth it gave great dissatisfaction that the law in this point particularly would be thus invaded and set at naught and the very best of the kings friends as well as his officers whether civil or military except such as were popishly inclined were strangely alarmed thereat and expressed themselves with great freedom whenever it happened to be the topic of their discourse  february next and that it was prorogued accordingly this gave birth to many conjectures some said the king had so good a revenue and was so good a manager that he had it in his power to subsist both his fleet and his army without more money and that therefore he would scarce have occasion for any more parliaments that this seemed the more likely as he had by this prorogation refused the sum of seven hundred thousand pounds which the commons were preparing to give him while others believed the king would certainly meet us again at the term prefixed and that in the mean time he would find out some expedient to satisfy the houses as to the only article they complained of meaning the affair of the popish officers which though it was said might be shrewdly doubted seeing that some of the gentlemen who had signalized themselves for the address were forbidden the kings presence which was the case of mr fox paymaster to the army lieutenant colonel darcy major webb and others we need not mention  to pass over lord brandons trial and condemnation for the concern he had had with the duke of monmouth we must now observe that the popish party behaved with great insolence which was the more remarked as the king of france was now in the height of persecuting his protestant subjects who many of them fled as they could poor and naked being stripped of all they had this so great and cruel an instance of the spirit that for the most part possesses those of this delusive persuasion was now the talk of all thinking people who began to be of opinion that every thing just and lawful ought to be done to obviate the growth and abate the present pride of the papists in our dominions but the king as if he had a mind to show us brandon who was to have been executed three days afterward which it must be owned was a great act of mercy in his majesty this lord having been pardoned in the late reign for breaking a boys neck when he was in his cups of which being convicted he was condemned as guilty of murder  at this time the favorites at court began to be at strife with each other the lord sunderland was made president of the council and continued secretary of state his lordship having artfully insinuated to the queen he had then a misunderstanding with the treasurer that the friends and relations of the kings first wife as rochester clarendon dartmouth and others were in greatest favor and in possession of the best places while her friends though she was queen consort were but slenderly provided for and her friends being reckoned to be lord sunderland the lord chancellor and the lord churchill they began to play their private batteries against each other  i for my part had seen so many changes backwards and forwards so many of both great and small removed and shifted about that i must confess the thoughts thereof began to damp the flight of my ambition and made me conclude there was a time when every sober man would choose to retire and be content with what he had rather than venture his substance and conscience upon the uncertain hazard of augmenting his wealth not that i found the king any way altered with regard to myself or that i despaired of keeping my ground though my great and good friend was out on the contrary could i but have strained to the pitch some did i am persuaded i had a fairer opportunity of raising my self than ever i had but i preferred a certain safety to an uncertain grandeur  but things now with regard to those who enjoyed any posts under the government seemed to be carried to a very extraordinary length for fox the paymaster of the army whose employ was valued at ten thousand pounds per annum and colonel john darcy grandchild and heir to the earl of holderness having offended the king by their votes in the lower house and having been thereupon forbidden the kings presence were now wholly laid aside and it was now said that in council it had been agreed that all persons who for the future offended in the same way would be served in the same manner which startled a number of people and now it was observed that the lord treasurer was more lowly and obliging than usual whence it was conjectured that the odds were against him and as much was confessed by some even of his his friends his lordship now setting up for the protestant interest and the queen and her friends for the popish  besides the gentlemen i have already named there were several other members dismissed from their employments for not voting as the king expected they should and particularly such as were officers in the army who being not only so but also great and very eminent for their families and services to the crown it was matter of great wonder to every body but what surprised me as much as any thing was to hear from the archbishop of york that lord marquess of hallifax was coming again into play an agreeable surprise this especially as the times seemed to turn but the very next day i had the mortification to understand from the marquisss own mouth that there was no manner of foundation for the report the duke of albemarle now told me several things concerning the state of affairs which astonished me very much gentlemen were now in a most unprecedented manner assaulted in the very streets one had a powder thrown into his eyes which deprived him of sight another had his throat cut by two men though neither of these gentlemen had given the least visible provocation or offense to the aggressors and the duke of albemarle was met by a gentleman who threatened him as his grace was going along in his chair and now it was whispered that the king would still farther prorogue the parliament till may which certainly was the wisest course he had at this time to take if he could not resolve to give some proper satisfaction to the houses with regard to the popish officers but that this was far from his thoughts and quite contrary to his intention appeared by a late admission of several others of that superstition into military posts in short the king unhappily persisting in his own way discharged his anger against the bishop of london a most worthy prelate brother to the late earl of northampton putting him away from the council board on account of a speech he had the last sessions made in the house of lords concernthe popist officers though as i was told by the archbishop of york it was spoken with all the deference and respect imaginable this decent speech was by some said to be the cause of his lordships dismission but others attributed it to his industry in keeping the princess of denmark within the pale of the protestant church in opposition to some extraordinary endeavors to get her over to that of the church of rome  delamere was this day tried by a particular commission directed to the lord high steward and thirty other peers the crime laid to his charge was conspiring to raise a rebellion and to subvert the government in conjunction with the duke of monmouth and other false traitors and so on i happened to sit near the king during the whole trial but the only positive evidence against his lordship was one saxton an obscure fellow who swore that about the time of the duke of monmouths landing he was recommended by the lord brandon to the lord delamere and discoursed with him at his house in cheshire upon the  th of june sir robert cotton and another gentleman being present that their conversation was about assistance to be given to the said duke and that his lordship should say he was engaged to raise  0000 men in his cause but that he could not effect it so soon as he had promised because of a present want he was under of money what the other witnesses had to allege was all circumstance and hearsay some said the duke of monmouth had told them he depended upon help from lord macclesfield lord brandon and lord delamere and that they would be ready to rise in cheshire as soon as he landed others swore that the duke had written and sent messages to his friends in london to give notice to the lords to be ready and that he was preparing for england in the course of this trial a point of law never before heard of was started by the lord high steward and the solicitor general namely that though there were but one positive evidence in a case of high treason if the rest though but circumstantial concurred therewith it was sufficient to find a prisoner guilty for example supposing one man should hear another say he intended to kill the king upon such a day and that another swears he saw the party lie in wait to prosecute his intention the evidence is sufficient but whatever there might be in this law it was by no means applicable to the prisoner for he most convincingly disproved the main evidence saxton and by the clearest testimony made it appear that neither the two gentlemen nor himself were upon the spot upon the  th of june that two of them were then actually in london and the other sixteen miles off he urged also that if the man had sworn nothing but truth against him he could be no legal witness being himself a prisoner and taken in rebellion when monmouth was routed and consequently under a temptation to swear against him to save his own life upon the whole he was acquitted every one of the peers declaring him not guilty there were those who condemned the lawyers who had advised the king to bring a peer to trial upon so slender a foundation while others observed that as the king had committed him to prison it was but fit he should be brought to a public trial lest it should be said he had been detained when nothing appeared against him but when all was over i plainly saw the king was in great rage with saxton and the next day he declared he should be first convicted for perjury and then hanged for high treason  london was a guest and some other gentlemen his lordship having according to custom drank deep at dinner called for one mountfort a gentleman of his who had been a comedian an excellent mimic and to divert the company as he was pleased to term it he made him plead before him in a feigned cause during which he aped all the great lawyers of the age in their tone of voice and in their action and gesture of body to the very great ridicule not only of the lawyers but of the law itself which to me did not seem altogether so prudent in a man of his losty station in the law diverting it certainly was but prudent in the lord high chancellor i shall never think it but let us step to the king  it was now know that mrs sidley who had been the kings mistress and had several children by him when duke of york but whom he had deserted for a while when he came to the crown was as much in his favor as ever for he created her countess of dorchester and visited her frequently which gave the queen a great deal of uneasiness but there was no help for it till at length her majestys party and priests did so importune the king and so pressingly remonstrate to him the sin of this amor and what was worse the disparagement it would throw on their religion that it was reported he would abandon his mistress and that he had sent her word either to retire into france or to expect to have her pension of four thousand pounds a year withdrawn  to resume the lord chancellor once again he had now like to have died of a fit of the stone which he virtuously brought upon himself by a furious debauch of wine at mr alderman duncombs where he the lord treasurer and others drank themselves into that height of frenzy that among friends it was whispered they had stripped into their shirts and that had not an accident prevented them they had got up on a signpost to drink the kings health which was the subject of much derision to say no worse  the term the parliament was prorogued to being expired the members of the house of commons and the lords met in their respective places the commons that appeared were to the number of about   0 and being summoned by the black rod to appear in the house of lords a commission directed to the lord chancellor lord treasurer and others impowering them or any of them to prorogue the parliament till the  0th of may next was read and the parliament was prorogued accordingly  though it could not be as yet said that the king had made any notable invasion on the rights of the church of england he recurred to all the methods he could contrive and practice for the increase of his own by putting more papists into office in this kingdom but especially in ireland by causing or at least allowing of popish books to be printed and sold and cried about publicly by publishing some popish papers found in the late kings closet by a declaration that his late majesty died a papist and in what manner by an account of the conversation of the late duchess of york together with her reasons for the same as written by her self by a lettter or order to the archbishop of canterbury to direct the clergy of his province to preach a good life but never to meddle with controversies in their sermons by sending the lord castleman upon a solemn embassy to the pope and by much more of the same nature and tendency which made it expected that more would infallibly follow  westminster hall there was a new chief justice of the common pleas and another new judge of the same bench there was a new chief baron in fine four new judges of the several courts this made a considerable noise as the gentlemen now displaced were of great learning and loyalty and whose only crime had been they would not give their opinions as several of their brethren had done that the king by his prerogative might dispense with the test required of roman catholics the next day i was informed by mr jones son to the chief justice of that name lately turned out that his father upon his dismission observed to the king that he was by no means sorry he was laid aside old and worn out as he was in his service but concerned that his majesty should expect such a construction of the law from him as he could not honestly give and that none but indigent ignorant or ambitious men would give their judgment as he expected and that to this his majesty made answer it was necessary his judges should be all of one mind he told me farther that sir robert sawyer the attorney general had been directed by the king to draw up a warrant by virtue of his prerogative to invest a priest of the church of rome with a benefice and to confirm one walker head of a house in oxford and some fellows of the same who had erred over to the papal communion by a non obstante that the attorney said this would not be against one statute only but against all the laws since the days of elizabeth that he therefore durst not do it and desired the king to weigh the matter a little with himself for that it struck at the very root o the protestant church quite contrary to his majestys late gracious promises in short that the attorney farther said he doubted not but as soon as another could be found to do the work he should lose his place such a slave was the king to the priesthood of rome  finch was now turned out one powis appointed in his stead who was ready and willing to do what the other refused which was to draw up a warrant for confirming of walker in his office of head of university college in oxford and three fellows of the same and another in behalf of the parson of putney which afterward passed the great seal though the parties were papists as strong as could be and to complete as it were all most of the protestant officers in the army in ireland were removed and papists substituted in their stead  the term of prorogation being elapsed it was by commission continued to the   d november following the king said this morning in his bedchamber that many of the politicians of the house of commons were come up in fear he should surprise them with doing of business but that he would not do by them as they had been wont to do with the crown a very extraordinary speech but three days afterward taking my leave of the lord dover late henry jermin esquire a papist and great favorite he told me the parliament would certainly meet at the time last limited and that if they would not comply with the king they were to look to the issue in short the king having lately got him a jesuit for his confessor drove on at a great rate and seemed by far more intent than before upon promoting and spreading his own religion in a word he was now edward hales a professed papist to whom the king having given a regiment of foot he was this term sued upon the statute for five hundred pounds he keeping his employment without the qualification required upon which occasion it was agreed  all the judges baron street excepted that the king had a power to dispense with all penal statutes and that his majesty enjoying alone the power was the only judge in the case and so sir edward pleading the kings pardon obtained the better of the prosecution an event which gave great surprise and occasioned much discourse the whole kingdom over  november to the   th of the february following after this the king continued his course of displacing protestants in favor of their enemies the papists and i expected when it was to be my turn for i had frequent alarms of that sort every post brought us account of officers both civil and military deprived of employment of some who resigned their commissions and places but the most general accounts were of persons actually discarded and that papists were for the most part put in to succeed them lord clarendon lord lieutenant of ireland was recalled and mr talbot a rigid irish papist a little before created earl of tyrconnel sent over in his room which made so dreadful an impression upon many protestants of that kingdom that they either left or sold their estates as they could and came over into england mr saville vicechamberlain to the king and who had been of his bedchamber when duke of york and since then ambassador in france was put out of all employment  york the assizes being there held an old woman was condemned for a witch those who were more credulous in points of this nature than my self conceived the evidence to be very strong against her the boy she was said to have bewitched fell down on a sudden before all the court when he saw her and would then as suddenly return to himself again and very distinctly relate the several injuries she had done him but in all this it was observed the boy was free from any distortion that he did not foam at the mouth and that his fits did not leave him gradually but all at once so that upon the whole the judge thought it proper to reprieve her in which he seemed to act the part of a wise man but though such is my own private opinion i cannot help continuing my story one of my soldiers being upon guard about eleven in the night at the gate of clifford tower the very night after the witch was arraigned he heard a great noise at the castle and going to the porch he there saw a scroll of paper creep from under the door which as he imagined by moonshine turned first into the shape of a monkey and thence assumed the form of a turkey cock which passed to and fro by him surprised at this he went to the prison and called the underkeeper who came and saw the scroll dance up and down and creep under the door where there was scarce an opening of the thickness of half a crown this extraordinary story i had from the mouth of both the one and the other and now leave it to be believed or disbelieved as the reader may be inclined this way or that  it is fit we observe that the way of dealing with men who proposed any business to themselves in the government and especially the members of both houses of parliament that were in possession of places and near the king was thus his majesty took them aside and told them the test act was made in the height of faction not so much in prejudice to the roman catholics in general as to himself in particular and to obviate his rightful accession that while that and the penal laws remained in force no soul of that persuasion could be safe that it was against all municipal law for freeborn subjects to be excluded the service of their prince or for a prince to be restrained from employing such subjects as he thought for his service and that therefore he hoped they would be so loyal as not to refuse him their voices for annulling such unreasonable laws every man that persisted in a refusal to comply with this suggestion was sure to be outed  the time for the meeting of the parliament now drawing near and several of the members neglecting to repair to london the king ordered the judges in their several circuits to feel the pulses of the men in consequence of which i was to my great surprise accosted at york by the judge who told me he had orders to talk with me upon the subject i asked him if his majesty had made particular mention of my name to which replying that he had only received a general order from the king to sound the inclinations of the several gentlemen who sat in parliament and that he had had a particular instruction from the chancellor only as to my self by name i desired time to consider of it and the next morning returned for answer that i perceived a denial would be construed into disloyalty that i had so lately waited on the king and given such assurance of my integrity that i could not apprehend his majesty could harbor any doubt as to me and the rather as he had not been pleased to make use of my name that i could not conceive my self obliged to declare my self to any body else but that if his majesty should think fit to say any thing to me farther than he had already when i had the honor of waiting on him next which i intended should be speedily i would so consult my loyalty and my conscience as to give him all the satisfaction in my power the judge told me he would make report of what i had said and did not seem to be very forward in pressing a compliance he had his orders and he obeyed them i deemed this to be the most prudent reply i could at this time make for had i answered in the affirmative i might have incurred the displeasure and censure of the greatest part of the nation if in the negative i should have utterly disobliged the king a caution the more necessary to be taken as there was no likelihood there would be any meeting of parliament to control him in his conduct however i believe that in all cases of this nature it is safest to unbosom ones self to the prince in person and as much as possible avoid the danger that may arise from the treachery the prejudice or the ignorance of a reporter  in consequence of this examination of the members a number of vacancies ensued and among others that were deprived was herbert the vice admiral of england and master of the robes he in those days enjoying places to the value of three thousand pounds a year the king having threatened and put his threats in execution and also made use of the most plausible persuasions to draw the majority of parliament into his own way of thinking as to the test and penal laws and all to no sort of purpose cared not to see them assembled at the time seemingly appointed and therefore this day declared in council november following his majesty upon the same occasion declared that it having been found impracticable to effect an uniformity in religion though it had been the great endeavor of four of his predecessors successively assisted as much as possible by their parliament and that such attempts having been experienced to be highly prejudicial to the kingdom witness the fatality of the rebellion in his fathers time he was now determined to issue out a declaration in favor of all sorts of dissenters that they might enjoy the free practice of their own religion hoping it might contribute to the general peace and quiet of the kingdom the increase of the people and the advancement of trade but whatever the reasons alleged were it appeared to most men that a deep design was laid to sap the foundations of the church of england nor could her sons but dread some extraordinary shocks though some there were who apprehending no very extraordinary consequence of these machinations believed such a toleration might be of public emolument if considered in a political view which was by much the most specious side of the building which shall close up this year  at length the declaration for liberty of england in their rights privileges and immunities as also the free and undisturbed exercise of their religion in all their churches but all this was too well understood to divide the protestant churches divide and impera that so the papists might with the more ease possess themselves of the highest place which the presbyterians or calvinists who had most of them began to conform seemed to be well aware of and therefore continued to resort to our churches though the anabaptists quakers and independants thought it worth their while to return their addresses of thanks and acknowledgment elated seemingly with this the king goes on in his old course of displacing gentlemen that had posts but particularly such as were of the parliament and obstinate enough to withstand his wishes and now the parliament being prorogued it was not thought worth the trouble to inquire which way any body stood inclined so that the late question concerning the test and penal laws was dropped or at least suspended all this inequality of usage wrought but upon few protestants either of estate or quality to change their faith little or not at all allured by the baits thrown in their way or terrified by the kings frowns and implacable displeasure honor therefore now was the grand bulwark of our religion gentlemen disdaining to have thought they could sacrifice the sweets of conscience to the mercenary views of a reward in the midst of this dies the duke of buckingham a man once of vast estate and oftentimes in high favor with the late king though never with the present a man of the most exquisite wit of his time the handsomest and best bred but unfortunately given up to pleasures unsteady in his ways and in all respects an enemy to himself  while addresses of thanks were every day presented to the king on the part of the various denominarions of dissenters and from some even of the church of england i had frequent alarms that the papists were in a way of persuading the king to grant them the manor of york as a seminary for the instruction of youth in the principles of their faith and i this day heard it was granted accordingly to one lawson a priest for a term of thirty years surprised at this i wrote to the lord bellassis the principal commissioner of the treasury remonstrating that i had had it by my commission of governor granted to myself by the late king and confirmed by this that it was worth sixty pounds a year to me and that it had cost me above two hundred pounds in repairs since i had enjoyed it and that as i had been allowed nothing for this expense i desired it might be either continued to me or that his majesty would be graciously pleased to grant me such a compensation in lieu thereof and consider me in my disbursment in such manner and proportion as in his great justice and wisdom he should think fit a few days afterward a proclamation came to hand bearing date the  d of july whereby the king dissolved the parliament and at once stunned the main body of the nation the next day the popes nuncio being to make his public entry at windsor the duke of somerset one of the lords of the bedchamber in waiting refused attendance at that solemnity for which he was forbid the court and deprived of all his places the same fate befell five of the six gentlemen of the privy chamber for the very self same cause so that every hour things looked worse and worse a while after i had a letter from lord feversham to acquaint me that according to my desire he had spoke to the king concerning the manor of york but that he had found he had promised it to father lawson for the uses above specified that his majesty told him he did not know i lived in it and that if i had been at any charge in repairs i should be considered for the same but added for my present comfort that was i not so good a man as he took me to be he would not have kept a governor at york so long as he had done but i shortly after had another letter from the same lord to tell me that the lords commissioners of the treasury had so represented the business to the king at windsor that no possitive resolution was as yet taken  in the midst of the impending dangers which seemed to threaten us there was a nobleman the marquess of winchester who had by his conduct persuaded some people to think him mad though he certainly acted upon principles of great human prudence this gentleman passing through yorkshire in his way to london i went to pay him a visit he had four coaches and an hundred horses in his retinue and staid ten days at a house he borrowed in our parts his custom was to dine at six or seven in the evening and his meal always lasted till six or seven the next morning during which he sometimes drank sometimes he listened to music sometimes he fell into discourse sometimes he took tobacco and sometimes he ate his victuals while the company had free choice to sit or rise to go or come to sleep or not the dishes and bottles were all the time before them on the table and when it was morning he would hunt or hawk if the weather was fair if not he would dance go to bed at eleven and repose himself till the evening notwithstanding this irregularity he was a man of great sense and though as i just now said some took him to be mad it is certain his meaning was to keep himself out of the way of more serious censure in these ticklish days and preserve his estate which he took great care of  the president of magdalen college in oxford mandamus requiring them to choose the bishop of that city in his stead but they answered locus plenus est the king taking oxford in his progress and the master and fellows of that college waiting on him he told them the people of the church of england had used him ill that they had behaved neither as gentlemen or good subjects and ordered them to go presently back to their election and choose the bishop or he would let them feel how heavy a hand a king had they went but returned this answer that they were sorry they should be so unfortunate as to fall under his majestys displeasure but that they could not proceed to a new choice without actual commission of wilful perjury and thereupon hoped he would excuse them now in this progress it was an observation generally made that the king courted the dissenters and discountenanced the church of england for the papists being by no means a body of themselves numerous enough to cope with the national church he thought to strengthen them by a junction with the dissenters whom he blinded with his liberty of conscience and with telling them that he desired a repeal of the test and penal laws for their ease and security as much as in behalf of the papists  a strange look it had that the very people who had lately been so indefatigably busy to divest him of his right and even to deprive him of life it having been in one parliament attempted to impeach him of high treason upon the statute against a reconciliation with the church of rome i say it looked strange that these very men should be preferred to those who had preserved him out of their hands not in parliament only but in the field also but it seems all considerations are of no worth or validity with a hearty zeal for the priesthood of rome and that oblivion is so far from being ingratitude that it is highly to be commended a most salutary expedient when for the advantage of mother church  london they were members of the church of england and nonconformists filled their places doctor hough president of magdalen college is now put out by certain visitors appointed by the king for that purpose for that he was elected by the statutes in contradiction to the kings mandamus but the doctor stoutly refused to quit till compelled by force and then appealed from the visitors to the king in westminster hall  lawson the priest i formerly mentioned to give me notice that the king having made him a grant of his house the manor of st marys in york for the honor of god and the good of his people he expected from my usual civility that i would give him free and easy possession to which i answered that i held it by virtue of a commission that constituted me governor of york that he could not think i would divest my self of it by my own act and deed that i had too great a veneration for the kings bounty and was too proud of his service to do that but that if his majesty positively commanded it i should have nothing to do but to obey with this reserve however that if his majesty gave it away i hoped and in justice it was a duty incumbent on him to endeavor it i was to have some equivalent for the loss several letters passed between us till at length the earl of feversham sent me word that it was actually granted while lawson flattered me with expectations that the king would consider me one way or other and informed me of several kind things his majesty should say of me  lawson comes in person and claims possession it being in vain to contest with him i ordered my housekeeper to give him admittance but he left it again for the present till i could move my goods the clear profits of this place to me besides the use of the house for my self and friends and grass and hay for my horses while i staid in town amounted to about forty pounds a year after this i expected the rest would soon follow for the king had caused or ordered the lord lieutenants of most if not all of the counties in england to call together their deputies and the justices of the peace and ask them these three questions   if in case the king should call a parliament and they should be chosen members of it whether or no they would vote to take away the test and penal laws   whether or no they would give their vote for such members as they believed would be for the repeal for the same   whether or no they would live peaceably and as christians ought to live with such as differed from them in religion some lord lieutenants who refused to comply with this order were turned out to give place to papists and the deputy lieutenants and justices of the peace who did not return a satisfactory answer were for the most part divested of office  this certainly was pushing the point by much too far nor could men forbear wondering to what purpose it could be meant for what answer could any gentleman pretend to give till he had heard the reasonings and debates of the house and who could pretend to answer for the man he voted to be a member or pretend to be sure of what sort of a mind he would be when he got to his seat in the house if the general inclination had been to deceive the king how easy was it for men to express themselves one way and resolve another besides it was striking at the very foundation of parliaments thus to preengage the members who according as things upon their meeting appeared to them are by the laws of the land allowed freedom of speech and freedom of judgment but the most general answer that was returned by the protestants of the church of england was that they if of the house would so vote as the reasons of the debate should prevail with them that they would vote for such as they thought would do the same and that they would live quietly with all men as good christians and loyal subjects about this time there were great removes of officers civil and military and most corporations were purged of their church of england aldermen and papists or dissenters appointed to succeed them the king however soon after seemingly abated of the rigor of this scrutiny though the lord lieutenants continued the inquiry in most counties but with very little success  while this was transacting in england the french king was engaged in a high dispute with his holiness of rome concerning the immunities and franchises of ambassadors in that city which though all the princes of the catholic religion submitted to the regulation of the king of france would not his ambassador who would have demanded the ancient rights was denied audience and persisting in the thing was declared excommunicated the cardinals were forbidden to visit him as an ambassador and the church of st lewis reputed the parochial church of the french nation whither the ambassador and his retinue repaired to the midnight mass of christmas was interdicted for admitting him to partake of the devotions of the season upon notice of this the parliament of paris was assembled and the attorney general drew up an appeal from rome to the next general council setting forth that the pope had no just claim to infallibility that he had no power to excommunicate princes that his priestly authority was of no weight in temporals and that the power of the keys was abused when subservient to evil ends that his holiness had not only in this acted contradictorily to his character as vicar but also in refusing bulls to such as his majesty had nominated and recommended to the vacant bishoprics in his own kingdom for no reason but because they would not acknowledge him to be infallible or as the italian doctors call him universal monarch that by this means there were no fewer than thirty vacancies unsupplied at this day and that the popes obstinacy ought to be controled as as the custom had formerly been with the church by oecumenic or national councils after this and much more the attorney withdrew and was by the parliament admitted as an appellant in the case the popes bull was at the same time declared void it was forbidden to disperse it within any part of the kingdom and ordered that the king should be humbly entreated to exert his authority as to the immunities and franchises of his ambassador at rome and to call such councils or assemblies of great men as might apply a remedy to the disorders that had arisen from the long vacancies of archbishoprics and bishoprics and lastly that he would prohibit all commerce with the court of rome nor suffer any money to be sent thither  this was a strange sort of a scene to us in england it was thought we were most inseparably linked together with our neighbor kingdom but while the one is abjectly endeavoring to crouch to the lash the other is seemingly resolved to slip her neck out of the collar but now a proclamation this news if it created any to speak of was continually interrupted by some violent or unequal act or other on the part of the king among the rest the earl of oxford the first of his dignity in the realm though low in fortune being commanded to use interest in his lieutenancy for the repeal of the penal laws and test and making answer in plain terms that he could not persuade others to that which in his own conscience he was averse to the king took his regiment of horse from him and gave it to the duke of berwick some time afterward the earl of burlington resigned his commission for the lord lieutenancy of the west riding of york into the hands of the king who immediately gave it to lord thomas howard only brother to the duke of norfolk a warm and zealous papist pursuant to the method his majesty had hitherto tenaciously observed with regard to most of the lieutenancies that became vacant in england  the west riding of yorkshire had not been examined as to the repeal of the test pomfret the popish justices in number six and sir john bointon the kings sergeant who as i presume aspired to be a judge moved that an address of thanks might be signed and presented to his majesty for his late indulgence as to matters of conscience and that not only by all the justices but by the two grand juries but none of the justices except the six above and one mr bull nor either of the grand juries would set their hands to this address so that the roman catholics sent it up signed by themselves as the act of the whole sessions by such tricks and artifices as these the king was deceived in the opinion his subjects had of his late indulgence three or four men in several places as well as this pretending to speak and answer for the whole corporation or county  thomas howard who had the same from the king to advise first with me upon that subject i told him that the method lately taken had most assuredly been of no advantage to his majesty most of the principal and powerful gentlemen in every county having been thereby thrust out of employment but that this new method would be attended with as great difficulties and be subject to the fame fallacy it being impossible for one man to pry into the recesses of another mans heart nay that it was even a hard matter for a man to promise for himself for according to the supposition he was to be either in parliament or out of it if he himself should be elected he could not honestly promise which way he should vote till he came to his seat and heard the debates and that if he was not elected it would be quite impossible in any degree to answer for the man he should choose for his representative that i believed most men thought a liberty of conscience might be of use and advantage to the nation if settled upon a proper foundation and with true regard to the rights and privileges of the church of england to this he replied that the king had openly declared the church of england should have any reasonable equivalent she could desire for her security provided an act might pass for the liberty of conscience and told me we should meet and talk farther upon this head which for the present i evaded as much as possible i cared not to explain myself quite having no inclination to expose myself any farther than was barely needful or to give characters of other men  having at two several times obtained leave to repair to london i there found affairs to stand much in the posture i expected the popish party was very urgent with the king to press the repeal of the laws against them and the other as obstinate and headstrong against it and what brought the dispute to a still greater degree of warmth was owing to what follows his majesty had lately renewed his proclamation for liberty of conscience and given order to the bishops to cause it be read in the churches of their respective dioceses the archbishop of canterbury and the rest of the order remonstrated against this setting forth in a petition they presented to the king that they could not pay his majesty obedience in what he was pleased to require of them that no bishop or minister of the church of england could assent to the proclamation which must of course be employed by their reading it or causing it to be read that a declaration of the same nature on the part of the king had been in parliament condemned twice in the late reign that therefore they might be liable to be called to an account hereafter for doing what had been adjudged contrary to law that though the king of himself could do no wrong his ministers or agents were responsible for whatever was done infractory of the law and though his majesty had been pleased to declare a liberty of conscience it was nevertheless the duty of the clergy as much as in them lay to persuade men into an adherence to their communion that for them to publish the kings pleasure in the manner required would be the same as if they told the people they needed not to come to church except they pleased and that by the same rule he might command them to read mass in their churches and be found to obey these and many other arguments were upon this occasion offered by the bishops at which the king conceived so violent a displeasure that they were commanded to appear in council before him on the  th of june  i was honored with a visit from the marquess of hallifax who expressed himself pretty well inclined for liberty of conscience but averse to the test and penal laws all at once though he was seemingly not unwilling it should be done gradually and upon wise and weighty considerations  canterbury and his six brethren were committed prisoners to the tower a severity most deeply resented by the whole church being then at whitehall i saw the bishops going to take water for the tower they all looked very cheerfully and the bishop of chichester in particular called to me and asked me how i did the next day the lord huntingdon one of the privy council told me that had the king known how far the thing would have gone he had never laid the injunction he did to have the declaration read in churches  trinity sunday about four minutes before ten in the morning the queen was delivered of a prince to the great joy of the court but as important as this event might seem to be little notice may be said to have been taken of it the imprisonment of the bishops was now uppermost in the minds of most of the people who flocked to them in such numbers for their blessing and to condole their hard usage that great and very extraordinary remarks were made both of persons and behavior among the rest ten nonconformist ministers went to pay them a visit which the king took so heinously that he sent for four of them to reprimand them but their answer was that they could not but adhere to the prisoners as men constant and firm to the protestant faith or to that purpose nay what is more extraordinary the very soldiers that kept guard in the tower would frequently drink good health to the bishops which being understood by sir edward hales constable of the tower he sent orders to the captain of the guard to see it was done no more but the answer he received was that they were doing it at the very instant and would drink that and no other health while the bishops were there  habeas corpus twentyone of the very prime of the nobility appeared at the kings bench to bail them and they were bailed accordingly upon this occasion the hall and palaceyards were crowded with thousands of people who begging their blessing as they passed the archbishop freely gave it and as freely at the same time exhorted them to be constant to their religion a fortnight afterward an england produced such arguments in their behalf that the judges were divided two of them declaring that the proofs did not extend to the making their petition or address a libel and two of them that they did which cost sir richard holloway and sir john powell their seats on the bench as soon as the term was over in the course of this trial the power of the king to dispense with the laws that grand point was most exquisitely discussed by the bishops council who were so much an overmatch for the kings that at court it was most heartily wished this business had never been pushed to such a crisis westminsterhall the palaceyards and all the streets about were thronged with an infinite people whose loud shouts and joyful acclamations upon hearing the bishops were acquitted were a very rebellion in noise though very far from so either in fact or intention bonfires were made not only in the city of london but in most towns in england as soon as the news reached them though there were strict and general orders given out to prevent all such doings and the clergy preached more loudly and more freely than ever against the errors of the latin church the next day i waited on the king to the camp on hounslowheath where every body observed him to labor under a very great disturbance of mind but he spoke very kindly to me as i rode by him upon several occasions  westminster and some days afterward at the same held for the county of middlesex at hickss hall where i found such a strange revolution among the justices of the peace so many papists and fanatics put into the commission that i neither sought business nor chose to mix with them at this last place there were several indicted as rioters for that they had been concerned in making of bonfires or contributed thereto but the grand jury would find no bill though they were sent out no less than three times so generally did the love of the bishops and the protestant cause prevail and now my lord hallifax advised me to consider with myself whether as affairs stood it were prudent to continue in my employments i answered i had great obligations to the king and would serve him as well as i could whilst he would allow me that honor without concerning himself with my religion  sunderland who had been long suspected for a papist now openly declared himself of that communion with the usual ceremonies in the kings chapel and ten or eleven days afterward the king went down to the thamess mouth as pretended only to take a view of the fleet but the real cause was to appease the seamen who were ready to mutiny on account of some of their captains who had publicly celebrated mass in their ships the king flattered them all he could went from ship to ship called them his children said he had nothing to do with their religion and that he granted liberty of conscience to all but that he expected they would behave like men of honor and courage when there should be occasion for their service though they were so far gratified that all the priests were ordered on shore admiral herbert an able seaman who n the king had discarded from several great posts because he would not promise to vote for the repeal went privately away to holland where he was made rearadmiral which raised anger in the king and the rather as a great many seamen went after him  norfolk came to visit me in london with whom discoursing upon the present situation of the kingdom i found him a very firm and steady protestant to which he had been converted in the late reign and by no means satisfied with the court some days afterward carrying my wife and daughter to windsor to wait on the queen i perceived the court to be under some consternation and the king in an ill humor though he was of an equanimity which made it difficult to discover at the news that the dutch had fitted out a large fleet as designed against us and that the french and dutch were on the brink of a rupture and would each of them press us soon to know which side we would take this considering the jealousies we were under on account of religion the violent discontents about the army and the ill time of the day it was to call a parliament for fresh supplies of money did very justly and reasonably disquiet the court and now the first thing the november following protesting in council that he was moved thereto more for the good and satisfaction of the nation than for any apprehension he was under of the dutch armament however he commanded all officers in general to their posts and drew the forces out of other garrisons and places to man the sea ports  designing for york i took leave of his he had to others concerning the repeal but he said nothing at all of it only enjoined me to stand a candidate for the next parliament at york which i would gladly have been excused but it could not be and so he wished me a good journey just at this time i had news that the question had been put the week before to all our justices of the west riding and that they had all answered in the negative so that i could not but think i had a lucky escape  i sent notice to the mayor and others of york that i intended to stand for one of their representatives at the ensuing election and found the magistracy would be for the most part against me though i had good encouragement from the other citizens the truth is i was at some loss to know how to act in this matter i was not desirous to be of this parliament not only because i was grown infirm and almost unfit to attend the duty of the house but also because i was afraid the king would expect more from me than my conscience would extend to for as i was determined not to violate this on the one side so i could hardly resolve to offend so good a master on the other in these straits i went to the king at windsor and showed him the letters i had sent to york and the answers i had received thereto desiring his majesty to indulge me with replies to three queries i had to make   whether seeing the contest was like to be both chargeable and difficult and the success extremely doubtful it was his pleasure i should stand he replied positively i should   whether as the opposition was very strong against me he would impute it to my remissness if i miscarried he promised he would not   whether he would assist me all he could to prevent my being baffled and particularly by such means as i should propose to him his answer was yes and he gave immediate orders to the lords for purging of corporations to make whatever change or alteration i desired in the city of york and to put in or out which the king it seems had reserved to himself by the last charter just as i pleased but i was careful of what i did in this regard i considered that if i put out none it would look as if i had no power and debase me into contempt and that if i displaced too many it might exasperate the city against me make them believe i was too deep in the court interest and prevent my success on the other hand i therefore only desired that the lord mayor might be dismissed his office and sir  thompson appointed in his stead which would prevent his being a member of parliament and that too mr edward tomson and mr ramsden who were my principal friends in the former election of me for york and were afterward turned out partly on my account might be restored as aldermen then taking leave of the king and presented him with some roman medals which he took very kindly he again charged me to do what i could to be chosen  i afterward desired mr brent the agent for corporation matters that if he had the power i might with some others i should name be added to the bench of justices in that city by a writ of assistance which he promised me should be done to leave this affair for the present there had at this time been fifty irishmen and papists sent for from ireland by the duke of berwick in order to be incorporated into his regiment every captain was to have some but lieutenant colonel beaumont and five captains more who were all that were then on the spot in quarters at portsmouth refused to take a man of them saying their companies were complete and that they were not to part with good soldiers and englishmen to make room for such as were inferior to them and foreigners desiring they might choose their own men or throw up their commissions the duke of berwick took great offense at this and sending an account of it to the king he dispatched twenty horse to bring them up in custody to windsor castle where they were to be tried by a council of war and they were brought up accordingly i spoke to them just as they arrived and found they were all resolved to stand it out but they told me the duke had not offered a man of the irish to any company then in his graces regiment which was very kind of him on his part and a miraculous escape on mine  mean while the prince of orange and the dutch ambassador had lately given the king assurances that their preparations were not against us but his majesty as if he made a doubt of it ordered great things toward a fleet for the spring and i was positively told by one that he had actually twenty five hundred thousand pounds in his coffers  beaumont and the five captains and they were all cashiered though with reluctance on the part of the king who seemed to dread the consequences of it they were offered forgiveness if they would but accept of the men but they all refused it which caused a great and general discontent throughout the army and particularly in that regiment most of which soon after quitted the same day sir walter vavasor and mr middleton came up to make report to the king of the answers they had received from the westriding and the corporations to the queries they had put to them in which i found the lord mayor and aldermen of york were so faulty that they would out of course and that i needed not give my self the trouble of getting them removed and more remarkably my greatest opposers so i left them to their stars and only insisted on the commission of assistance for my self and friends i should name but every post brought me new fears i should not be chosen at york though several alterations and restrictions from popular elections to a mayor and twelve aldermen whom the king appointed as he pleased were now made by new charters for the more certain election of such members as might be to the kings good liking and now lord hallifax when i took leave of him which was this day advised me not  a few days afterward i sat out for yorkshire and being at my seat in the country i received advice that my interest at york was much lessened by my absence and what was still worse that lord montgomerys company being ordered to march from that city his lordship would if i did not come speedily be obliged to deliver up the keys into the hands of the lord mayor i therefore immediately posted away and received the keys and the company marched i represented it to the king as a great inconvenience that there should not be so much as one company in garrison at york and desired to know what i was to do with the keys to the first of which his majesty answered that upon more mature deliberation he had recalled the company and that as to the second i might dispose of the keys as i saw proper  greatest enemy to my election not having patience to stay till i came dismissed it almost as soon as assembled fearing i should make some proselytes to my interest just on the back of this comes down a proclamation setting forth a certain intention the prince of orange had to invade this kingdom by the assistance and with the concurrence of the states general both with a strong fleet and a numerous army commanding all lord lieutenants deputy lieutenants and all other his majestys officers to hold themselves in readiness to defend the king and kingdom at this time lord thomas howard was lieutenant of the west riding a rigid papist and now gone ambassador to rome he had left but three deputies behind him two of which also were papists and but two of the three were now in the country while most of the gentry of yorkshire were come to the city expecting to meet with writs for the choice of members i therefore pressed the high sheriff to give notice to some gentlemen while i convened others for the next day when sir henry gooderick began a discourse which i seconded to show how little we were able to serve the king with the militia without another lord lieutenant under whom we might lawfully serve meaning a protestant and at the same time we subscribed a representation of our case to his majesty i was well aware how very ungrateful this would be to him but to obviate his displeasure i gave him private intelligence of the intention to prepare it and begged of him to excuse the concern i had therein assuring him it was now absolutely for his service  fairfax a roman catholic and lord lieutenant of the north riding being at york observed to me it could be for no good end that the lords devonshire and danby were come down to the country tho the former pretended he was only come to view his estate and the latter to drink the waters at knaisbourgh they were both of them frequently engaged in conversation at sir henry goodericks and the first of them came to york where i paid all imaginable civilities to him and received the same from him the other i waited on at sir henrys not once suspecting that men of their high quality and great estate could intend any thing prejudicial to the government or dangerous to themselves and indeed their outward behavior was very decent and innocent  two days afterward i had an express from lord preston the new secretary of state sunderland who was turned papist and had been the author of great mischief since he had been near the king being laid aside to acquaint me that his majesty had given a very kind reception to our representation on the part of the county and that in compliance therewith he had named the duke of newcastle to be lord lieutenant of all yorkshire and his grace coming to town soon after appointed his deputies and militia officers both horse and foot the king began now though fatally too late to be sensible of his error in carrying matters to so enormous a length at the instigation of popish councils and now restored several justices of the peace in most counties as also the old charters all england over he now quits his hold of the bishop of london does justice to magdalen college and begins again to court the church of england  orange increased daily and that his fleet was ready to spread canvass for the sea three days afterward i had orders from the king to receive seven hundred scotch horse and dragoons on york for the security of both the city and country but the danger hourly approaching the apprehensions of the prince of oranges descent growing stronger and stronger and the king being willing to have his army in as numerous a plight as might be they were ordered to continue their march southward after they had been with us but three days the duke of newcastle who kept nothing a secret from me told me he had heard lord danby had a great sum of money in the bank of holland and that he had been invited up to london by my lord bellassis and the kings order that he had made some offers of his service but that he had no manner of intention to go up which last i very well knew from other hands  danby at the deans house his lordship broke out into these expressions we are now every way in an ill condition in this kingdom  if the king beats the prince of orange popery will return upon us with more violence than ever  if the prince beats the king the crown and the nation may be in no small danger the fate lord mayor being now superseded though it was impossible to swear the new one in because of some mistakes with regard to the new charter it may be said that york was now a very remarkable place for it was an archbishopric without a bishop a city without a mayor and a garrison without a soldier but these defects were soon supplied the old charter was restored and the old lord mayor therewith the bishop of exeter who fled from that city upon the prince of oranges landing was made archbishop of york and i had one company of foot sent to continue with me  strange it was and a certain presage of the mischiefs which attended this invasion that neither the gentry nor the commonality were under any concern about it said they the prince comes only to maintain the protestant religion  he will do no harm to england while on the other hand it was from court suggested that his aim was at the crown and that the dutch who assisted him grasped at the trade of england in truth his highnesses declaration when it made its appearance which was a little while before he landed seemed to be dark and ambiguous enough setting forth all the grievances of the nation with great aggravation and asserting that the kings intention was to subvert the government both in church and state that he designed to make himself absolute and to extirpate the protestant religion that to this purpose he had insisted on a dispensing power that he had molded and fashioned all the charters to his mind to the end he might have such members of parliament as he desired that he had examined and preengaged such as he intended should be of the house of commons and that what was worse he had imposed a suppositious prince of wales upon the nation merely to promote popery and to defeat the prince and princess of orange of their right of succession  the king understanding there was a great noise raised about this prince of wales had a little before the invasion called an extraordinary council whither all the nobility bishops and foreign ministers were summoned before whom the queen dowager several lords and ladies and the kings and queens servants to the number of forty as well protestants as papists gave pregnant evidence concerning the birth of this prince all which was reexamined in chancery upon oath and there recorded  dutch fleet had been miserably shattered by tempest that lord sunderland was certainly out and lord preston secretary of state in his stead the king mean while made great preparations for war and had swelled up his army as was computed to six thousand horse and dragoons and thirty eight thousand foot the fleet also was out under the command of lord dartmouth but much inferior to the dutch and did nothing to the purpose three days afterward the prince of oranges declaration conveyed by an unknown hand to a citizen of ours was brought to me and i immediately transmitted it to the secretary of state orders were at the same time sent down to us to secure the lord lumley then in the north riding but the gentleman colonel john darcy who was charged with this commission pretended he could not find him though it afterward appeared his lordship was not far off and might have been seized at pleasure the next day i had an express from the secretary at war signifying that the dutch fleet had been seen off dover steering their course to the westward which gave us some hopes there was no danger of their landing in the north in three days more i received by another express that the prince was actually landed at torbay in the west on the  th of this month november and that he had marched strait to exeter attended by marshall schomberg an old and experienced officer together with a number of our own nobility and gentry of considerable name and a great land army  i immediately sent the duke of newcastle word of this invasion though he had notice of it from above but he wrote back that the prince being landed at such a distance his presence would be no way necessary at york i thought this a very weak answer and sent him word that the danger was not only from the invaders but also from their confederates at home and that it was impossible the prince should dare to attack england with an army of under  0000 men if he was not very sure of assistance from our selves the deputy lieutenants being ten in number were now all at york and being very sollicitous to preserve peace quiet and good order proposed a meeting of the gentry and freeholders of the county to be held on thursday the   th instant in order to draw up some declaration of unshaken loyalty to the king in this time of danger as also to consult on such matters as might be for the honor of god and our own welfare and safety this being a motion made by sir henry gooderick i seconded it and observed that an address of such a tenor might give some satisfaction to the government and be a discouragement to its enemies accordingly a summons was drawn up to be dispersed all the country over and in the mean time i wrote up to lord preston the secretary of state to acquaint him with this seemingly intended loyal address from the gentlemen in our parts and sent a letter to the duke of newcastle desiring him to make one of the company  fairfax sir henry gooderick and others at a gentlemans who had invited us the clerk of the peace of the west riding comes in to give us notice of a new commission in which some thirty of the principal gentlemen of the neighborhood were left out and among the rest sir henry himself this threw him into such a rage that he vowed he was sorry he had promoted the meeting he had for the service of the king but i heard that at this intended assembly there were to have been some points discussed which would not have been of so grateful a nature to the court for it was at the same time the design to have petitioned for a speedy and a free parliament and for other concessions which were to have been demanded and insisted upon but all this was all along denied to me and particularly by sir henry gooderick who being an open man i confess i added faith to his words but friendship is too often a blind to the eyes  four days after this the duke of newcastle york and said he heard there was a design to petition for a free parliament and that he thought it not fit there should be so much of the militia together i sat that night with his grace till it was twelve of the clock and we came to a resolution that if the petition or intended address was not conceived in terms of the strictest loyalty we would not set our hands to it the next day his grace called together his deputy lieutenants and asked them if there was any thing meant by their assembly on thursday more than to make a declaration of loyalty to his majesty whereupon sir henry gooderick who was one of them declared plainly that he intended to petition for a free parliament and hoped that the rest who should meet would concur therein after the example of a late petition from some bishops and some temporal lords the duke took this so much amiss that he declared he would not stay to be affronted or overuled by his deputies and that he would be gone the next day i made opposition to this observing that no absolute resolution could be taken till the gentlemen appeared and that if ought else besides a mere declaration of loyalty were thought necessary it might be so penned and with that modesty as both to satisfy here and not displease above in short that his grace ought at all events to be on the spot in a time of such great trouble and difficulty but he went away according to his word saying no body had been of his side but my self  henry gooderick delivered himself to this effect that there having been great endeavors made by the government of late years to bring popery into the kingdom and by many devices to set at naught the laws of the land there could be no proper redress of the many grievances we labored under but by a free parliament that now was the only time to prefer a petition of the sort and that they could not imitate a better pattern than had been set before them by several lords spiritual and temporal there were those who differed with him in opinion and would have had some expressions in the paper moderated and amended and observed that at the same time they petitioned as they designed it would be but their duty to assure his majesty they would stand firm by him in the midst of the dangers which threatened both him and his kingdoms at the hazard of their lives and fortunes but this was overuled when therefore the draught was completed according to the mind of sir henry gooderick and his friends though several disliked it and went away they proceeded to sign but before a third man could subscribe it in comes one mr tankard with a rueful story that the papists were risen and that they had actually fired upon the militia troops alarmed at this the gentlemen ran out and those that were privy to the design betook them to their horses which were conveniently at hand for their purpose lord danby mean while in his lodging waited for the false alarm and mounted with his son lord lumley lord horton lord willoughby and others who together with their servants formed a body of horse consisting of a hundred in number well mounted and well accoutred these rode up to the four militia troops drawn out on another account and cried out a free parliament the protestant religion and no popery the captains of these troops were lord fairfax sir thomas gower mr robinson and captain tankard who being admitted of the secret the night before though prompt and ready enough in their nature for any action of the kind immediately cried out the same and led their troops over to them in the first place they went to the main guard of the standing company which the number not exceeding twenty they surprised before i had the least notice or even jealousy of what was in agitation not thinking it possible that men of such quality such estates could give way to their discontent however great and just it might be to the degree of engaging themselves in an attempt so desperate and so contrary to the laws they boasted and the religion they professed but i had no sooner notice of what had been transacted than i sent for the officers and the guard and understood they were prisoners i then sent to each captain of the four troops injoining him to bring his troop to me as the kings governor as also to the main guard of the militia foot but they would not stir a step they would hearken to no orders i then sent for my own horses and was just ready to go to the troops in hopes by my presence to regain them to the kings service when sir henry bellassis who had commanded a regiment in holland under the prince and had lurked about a long while in yorkshire for his highnesss service drew up a party of thirty horse before my door and prevented my stirring abroad till lord danby and his principal companions came up to me  his lordship told me that to resist were to no manner of end or purpose that himself and the gentlemen with him were in arms for a free parliament and the preservation of the protestant religion and government as by law established which the king had almost brought to nothing and which the prince of orange was come to restore and that he hoped i would join them in so laudable an effort i made answer that i was for a free parliament and the protestant religion as well as they but that i was also for the king his lordship replied that he was so too and that he hoped as we agreed in principles we should concur in action i told him though we exactly agreed in the matter we differed widely as to the manner and i could not conceive it lawful to extort any thing from the crown by any manner of force and that as i had the honor of being his majestys governor for york it was impossible whatever the consequences might be for me to join in concert with those who openly and avowedly acted in repugnance to and contempt of his authority and commission his lordship then said he must imprison me to which i made answer that i was naked and destitute of friends and assistance and that i acknowledged my self in his lordships power to do with me as he would but after some short consultation his lordship told me he knew me to be a man of honor and that he should think my engagement not to stir to be as sure and as close a restraint upon me as a guard or a prison so that upon the pledge of my honor i was to confine my self to my room his lordship however recommended what he had offered to my farther consideration they then seized on all the gates posted strong guards every where and suffered none to go in or out they secured such persons as betrayed a dislike to their proceedings and especially the officers of the company but the company it self revolted to them the next day  gathered to this head the next day they visited the magazine and stores which god knows were next to nothing notwithstanding all my most pressing remonstrances to the king both formerly and of late the militia troops then and some of the gentlemen who came in to serve as volunteers and who were not above sixty ransacked the houses of several papists for priests arms and horses which they took wherever they found them they seized also on a company of foot new raised but not yet armed in their quarters at tadcaster and a company of grenadiers as they were on their march for london by the way of york but as yet they touched the property of no man but the kings the papists and my self excepted for they made very free with my coals and other provision i had said in for the use of the garrison  being the next day printed there appeared of hands of lords to it six of lords sons three of baronets five of knights six of esquires and gentlemen sixty six and of citizens of york fifty six we had now news from nottingham that the earl of devonshire lord delamere and many more noblemen and gentlemen were risen also in those parts and that great numbers flocked in to them  mean while the king was on his march to salisbury which he had appointed to be the general rendezvous of his whole army having sent the young prince his son to portsmouth as the report was by some but to france according to others in a day or two i made it my request to the earl of danby that he would give me leave to be a prisoner at my own house in the country where i promised to act nothing to his prejudice but to aquiesce and abide by my word as a true prisoner hereupon he sent for me to come and dine with him and at my coming into the room told me that to give me the better stomach to my meal i might upon the terms i had proposed depart whenever i pleased at dinner his lordship told me the duke of newcastles absence had been what principally favored their design and that he doubted not but i had some fear or suspicion of what was going forward i answered that i did indeed believe they would go very high in their petition but never imagined so many gentlemen of their rank and quality would have ventured upon so perilous an expedient and that if i had been aware of it i should certainly have made a resistance though to ever so little purpose or at least have made my escape out of the town i had discourse with several of these gentlemen and perceived that they began to reflect on what they had done as of more danger than they at first thought of and found they were troubled that men come in so slowly to them lord willoughby said it was the first time that any bertie had been concerned against the crown that it was a grief to him but that the necessity of the times was fatally such that there had been no avoiding it to this i observed that the flagrant invasion on our rights might have been restrained without a repessing force and that a thorough and plain representation of our injuries properly urged on the part of the whole kingdom could not have failed to reduce the king to a better and juster sense of what he was about that the great want of money the violent distraction of the nation and a plain discovery that popery could never again be imposed upon us would have obliged his majesty for his own sake for his own safety and interest to have altered the tenor of his conduct sir henry gooderick would then have persuaded me to sign their declaration but i told them i could not possibly do it for that though i should be of a mind with them as to the matter it contained yet being now in arms i could not in my judgment conceive but a concurrence with them as to the contents of their paper might be justly construed into a joining with them in the force mr tankard also most earnestly pressed me to be with them but i held out in the midst of this comes the clerk of the peace to give me notice of a new commission that was brought down which restored all the gentlemen of the west riding i have formerly observed to have been turned out but that myself and two more were omitted lord danby immediately took up this and told me it was plain there was a resentment against me and that it was very evident i should meet with worse quarter on the other side than from them but all this had no manner of effect upon me the next day the duke of newcastle sent orders to his captains of horse to dismiss the militia troops but they instead of obeying his orders laughed at him for his illtimed message  this day i obtained a pass of their generalships to go to my own home upon my parole that i would confine my self there nor exceed the bounds of five miles about and live peaceably and quietly and abstain from all manner of hostile action we had now news as if the army had voted for a free parliament though at the same time they declared they would defend his majestys person from all men without exception the very matter i desired to be the contents of our yorkshire petition but on the heels of this laudable resolution it happened as we were told that a number of great men officers of the army and particular confidents of the king had revolted and gone over to the prince of orange particularly that on the   th of november the king having then reached salisbury where his army was rendezvoused the lord churchill one of his major generals under pretense of showing him his outguards misled his majesty into a train which must have betrayed him to the hands of a party of the prince of oranges army had not an immoderate bleeding at the nose prevented the king from proceeding and that the said lord perceiving his design to be thus frustrated immediately went over to the prince accompanied by the duke of grafton colonel berkley and others though it must be observed that this lord churchill was raifed from a page to the king to the degree of a viscount of england and in possession of a great estate therewith which was entirely owing to his majestys bounty the king astonished and not knowing who to trust returned to andover on the   th where he sat at supper with prince george of denmark his soninlaw and the duke of ormond bnt to the surprise of all men they both deserted him that very night and withdrew to the prince together with others of good note and account the very next day the princess of denmark departed privately from whitehall in company with lady churchill and took refuge at nottingham now the number of all that thus forsook the king did not as yet amount to one thousand but such a mutual jealousy now took birth that there was no relying on any one no knowing who would be true and honest to the cause wherefore the army and artillery were ordered to retire back toward london where his majesty arrived on the   th his outquarters being at windsor reading and places round about  the next day he called together all the lords spiritual and temporal then in town being about fifty in number and pursuant to their advice writs were immediately issued out for calling a free parliament and for removing all roman catholics from councils and employments for issuing out a general pardon to all who were with the prince and for sending commissioners to treat with him the proclamation accordingly came out the parliament was to meet upon the   th of january next ensuing and the lords hallifax nottingham and godolphin were appointed commissioners to the prince but to return back a little to our northern parts kingston upon hull or hull that considerable garrison was at this time surprised by mr copley the lieutenant governor who gathering a party to him seized the governor himself lord langdale in the night as also a number of roman catholics who fled for refuge to that place and the soldiers joining in the treachery they declared for the king and the protestant religion and sent immediate notice to york of what they had done about the same time a party was dispatched from york to seize the duke of newcastles horses and arms which they did but no manner of attempt or injury was offered to his graces person in short there were but few gentlemen in our parts of the county that adhered to the king nor indeed in any part of the north of england  plymouth bristol and other places submitted themselves to the prince and the defection began to be general in the midst as it were of this the prince of wales is brought from portsmouth to london when every soul concluded he was in france but he made no continuance the queen the very next night being sunday carrying him about twelve of the clock down to a vessel privately prepared which by a favorable gale was wafted over to dunkirk the next day a regiment of scotch horse deserted to the prince nor was there an hour scarce but his majesty received like job ill news of one sort or other so that prompted thereto by most fatal advice he the next day being the   th withdrew himself privately attended only by two or three persons to follow the queen as was then most commonly believed this was very extraordinary and quite wonderful for his commissioners having just before sent him word that affairs might be managed with the prince to his majestys satisfaction he had summoned his cabinet council to meet the next day at nine in the morning though he seems he intended nothing less than to be with them for he went away that very night without so much as leaving any order or direction behind him the lord chancellor withdrew at the same time and took the broad seal along with him so that all was now in the utmost confusion nor is the consternation to be expressed upon this the lords as well spiritual as temporal wrote to his highness of orange to let him know the king was gone from them and to acquaint him they would endeavor to keep things in order till they could receive his directions and to invite him to town  the rabble had been before sufficiently incensed against the papists but now apprehending and reasonably enough that the king had withdrawn himself by their advice or rather at their instigation they grew to that height of outrage that rising in prodigious multitudes and dividing themselves into great parties they pulled down the chapels of that worship as well as the houses of many of its professors taking and spoiling their goods and imprisoning such as they suspected to be priests nor did they spare even the chapels and houses of ambassadors and other foreign ministers and particularly the spanish ambassador who as was generally computed of his own and others who sought his protection had goods and plate to the value of one hundred thousand pounds taken from him what was of less worth and belonging to that superstition was burnt publicly in the street the same day the lord chancellor who had waited too long for the tide though in the disguise of a seaman and destitute of his eyebrows which he had purposely cut off was stopped at wapping taken and committed to the tower by order of the lords he was first brought to the lord mayor upon suspicion only but being soon known they were obliged to give him a strong guard or he had certainly been torn to pieces pen the great quaker a man of reputed wit and much consulted by the king with regard to the dispensing power he would unfortunately have usurped and the scheme of liberty of conscience was taken also as was father peters that incendiary that scandal to the privy council where he was the first of his pernicious order that had sat for many a year before  the king however upon his departure wrote to the general officers of his army signifying that things being brought to extremities and being obliged to send away the queen and the prince he was forced to follow himself but hoped it might at some time or other please god to touch the hearts of this nation with true loyalty and honor that could he but have trusted to his troops he would at least have had one blow for it but that though there were some loyal and brave men among them both officers and soldiers it was their advice to him not to venture himself at their head or to fight the prince of orange with them he thanked those for their fidelity who had been true to him and added that though he did not expect they should expose themselves by resisting a foreign army and a poisoned nation he hoped they would preserve themselves disengaged from associations and all such evil doings in the postcript he told them that as he had ever found them loyal so they ever had and ever should find in him a kind master lord feversham then commanding as general dispatched this letter to the prince of orange and sent him word that having thereby directions to make no opposition he had to prevent the effusion of christian blood given notice of the same to his army which had thereupon in great measure disbanded  his majesty in the mean time endeavoring to forsake the kingdom in a hoy with few of his attendance among whom was sir edward hales and stretching over from an island in kent was boarded by a boat with thirty six armed men who were bound as they called it a priestcodding or catching they used the king but especially those that were with him with great rudeness and incivility and took from his majesty three hundred guineas all he was at that time worth and his sword but when they came to understand who he was they offered to restore him both but he would take back nothing but his sword being brought to shore he went to lord winchelseas where he was taken with another fit of bleeding at the nose which made him very weak and very sick information of this being sent up to the lords at whitehall they ordered four noblemen aylsbury middleton yarmouth and another with some of his servants to attend him and carry him necessaries some of the guards also and lord feversham waited upon him but their orders were to leave it to his majestys own choice either to go or to return it being deemed unfit to put any restraint upon him much about the same time the lords peterborough and salisbury who had been lately converted by father walker master of university college in oxford were also taken but the prince of orange being invited to london had reached windsor before he knew the king had been intercepted  before his highness came to town he sent his own people to possess themselves of the tower he quartered them in and near the town and posted them at whitehall and at two in the morning sent his majesty notice that he must remove from thence that day to some place ten or twelve miles distant and be attended by his highnesss guards his majesty therefore went to rochester attended by lord dunbarton lord aylsbury and lord arran and then the prince came to st jamess where he was complimented by many of the nobility the bells rang bonfires were lighted up nor was any public profession of joy wanting among the rabble while serious men in the city seemed to think it hard the king should be so forced to withdraw himself a second time  the prince upon his arrival seemed more inclined to the presbyterians than to the members of the church which startled the clergy he ordered as many of the kings forces to be gathered together as possible and confined lord feversham to windsor castle for having disbanded them and for other matters laid to his charge nor must we forget that his highness assumed so much to himself as to make the duke of beaufort wait full four hours before he would give him admittance the king alarmed at this proceeding began to think himself in danger and sent to the lords signifying it was his desire to go out of the kingdom their lordships took some time to consider on the answer they were to make but while they were in the midst of their deliberation he gratifyed himself in his own desire and went privately away and now the english guards and other troops were by the prince sent to the distance of twenty miles from london to make room for the foreign soldiery he had brought with him  the lords having for some time sat in their house and finding that his majesty would not appoint another chancellor or keeper or produce the great seal the lords i say being about sixty in number as well spiritual as temporal lord hallifax being in the chair made an order to banish all papists that had not kept house for four years last past to the distance of ten miles from the city their lordships ceased not to sit though it was christmassday and among other things framed an address to the prince that he would take the government on himself till affairs could be settled and the next day a certain number of lords were appointed to wait on him therewith but his highness said he could give no answer to it till he had the opinion of the commons for it was but two days before that he had ordered the lord mayor and fifty of the aldermen and common council together with all such gentlemen as had been members of parliament in the late reign and were in town to meet together in the house of commons to sit there as a committee in imitation of the lords they met accordingly to the number of about  00 and voted a concurrence with the lords in most things and particularly in their address to the prince to take the government upon him till the   d of january when a convention was to be summoned the writs it should seem that had been issued out for the calling of a parliament and the elections that had thereupon been made becoming void and of none effect all this was transacted in the midst of almost a dead calm no mischief was attempted no disorders raised or fomented but all was peace acquiescence and submission  ireland into such a condition as might best maintain the protestant religion and english interest in that kingdom and that he would at all times hazard himself for the laws and liberties of these kingdoms and the preservation of the protestant faith it being the very end for which he came  news now came that the king was safe arrived in france and that he was gone to the queen who was at paris the french king at first prepared the castle of vincennes for their reception and entertainment but their majestys afterward removed to st germains the king thus absent in a strange land the lord tyrconnel lieutenant of ireland nevertheless remained firm and steadfast to his majesty with a numerous army of papists while lord inchequin headed another of protestants and had taken londonderry and some other strong towns in that kingdom london where being arrived i was presently sensible of a great alteration the guards and other parts of the army which both for their persons and gallantry were an ornament to the place were sent to quarter at a distance while the streets swarmed with illfavored and illaccoutred dutchmen and other strangers of the princes army and yet the city seemed to be mightily pleased with their deliverers nor perceived their deformity or the oppression they labored under by far more unsupportable than ever they had suffered from the english  though the convention met on the   d there was nothing considerable done till the   th when the settlement of the nation being taken into consideration by the commons they voted that king james ii having endeavored to subvert the government of this kingdom by breaking the original contract between the king and the people and by the advice of jesuits and other wicked persons having subverted the fundamental laws and having lastly withdrawn himself from the kingdom had abdicated the government and the throne was thereby vacant the next day the regent or protector some again were for having it that the king should forfeit the crown and the prince be elected thereto and others again were for having the prince and princess crowned as in the case of philip and mary and that the prince should be king by descent in right of his wife while no notice was to be taken of the prince of wales who should be rendered incapable to succeed as a roman catholic he having been baptized in that church at length their lordships first that it had been found inconsistent for a protestant kingdom to be governed by a popish prince secondly that a committee should be appointed to bring in general heads of what was absolutely necessary for the better security of our religion laws and liberty this last vote or resolution was of most high importance and wisely intended to give birth to the conditions on which the person that next filled the throne should be entitled thereto and to bind him down to a more strict observance of what ought to be than had heretofore been the case mean while the prince seemed not at all to concern himself with what was going forward and only desired that the circumstances of holland and ireland requiring it they would make all possible dispatch and come to as early a conclusion as they could  abdicated and would have had deserted substituted in lieu thereof nor could they quite agree with them that the throne was absolutely vacant so that there was still room for the constitution of a regent or protector or even for a revocation of the king himself upon terms  hallifax in company with mr seymour the quondam speaker of the commons a man of great parts and much for continuing the power in the kings name and even in his person could we but be secured from the danger of popery dr burnet also was present who with great violence argued that the prince was to be crowned and urged that england could never be happily settled till his highness was at the helm and this kingdom in strict conjunction with holland seymour said his proposals were impracticable for that if the prince was king he must maintain himself as such by the means of an army which was not to be relied on against their natural sovereign he observed that as the late english army would not fight for popery they would be as backward in fighting against their king and that it was impossible for england and holland to join heartily in one and the same interest being suitors as they were to one and the same mistress namely trade that same night my lord hallisax told me he was not at first in the secret of the princes expedition but that as his highness was now with us and upon so good an occasion he thought we were obliged to stand by and defend him i told him i had heard lord danby expected to be beforehand with him in the princes good graces but he gave me some reasons to make me believe otherwise took notice that his lordship began to lag in his zeal and concluded that the said lord could have no hopes of being treasurer his highness having declared he would have commissioners for the execution of that office his lordship then proceeded to tell me he himself should be employed and offered to me some arguments to prove the legality of serving under the future government particularly that though the king had relinquished his function the constitution was not for that reason to be suffered to fall that fall it must if men would not act under those to whom it was delegated in fine that in our present circumstances the salus populi was to be the lex suprema his lordship then continued that there were so many who declined to serve and so few who were fit for it that if i had a mind to engage myself there would be doubtless room sufficient for me and that after things were upon a stable foundation i might entertain some thoughts of being sent ambassador to some prince or state whereby i might be out of the way till the clouds which hung over us were dispersed and blown away his lordship then offered to carry me the next morning to the prince whom i had not yet seen advised me to be cautious of the company i kept and to be very circumspect in all my actions and behavior  the next day i went to meet the marquess who was with the prince in his bedchamber but coming out to me he told me his highness could not be publicly seen of two hours yet to come and advised me to defer the waiting on him till the next day at the same time the lords who were for conferring the crown immediately on the prince began to apprehend the adverse parties might prevail against them wherefore they found means to stir up the people who in a tumultuous manner offered a petition to the two houses of parliament that they would crown both the prince and princess of orange and take speedy care of liberty and property as well as for the defense of ireland but the lords rejected it because it was not signed and the commons did the same saying they would not be awed in their votes nor be directed for that they ought to be free the very same day the king sent two letters the one to the lords the other to the commons but the messenger not being present to testify they were brought from the king they were laid by and the person who brought them was ordered to attend on the lords the monday morning next at this very juncture i was told by a court lady that it was much wondered my friend the marquess of hallifax had been so eager for the kings having abdicated the government when he absolutely knew his majesty had never gone if he had not been frightened into it she assured me his lordship had treated with the king to come again into business a few weeks before the princes intention was certainly known that she was the very person his lordship sent to the king that the king actually gave him a meeting at her house that they had agreed upon terms nay what is more that his lordship had treated with some priests for his return to court that upon this account his majesty particularly depended upon him when he named him one of the commissioners to go to the prince that after having conferred with his highness he sent the king a private letter intimating an ill design against his person and that this was the real cause of his majestys flight and the departure of the queen that after the king was brought back lord hallifax was one of the peers that came and admonished him on behalf of the prince to leave whitehall for rochester or ham within the short space of two hours and that his lordships reason for conveying this ungrateful message to his majesty was that he was assured the princes party had in council resolved to seize on his person and imprison him that upon the whole it must be notoriously known to his lordship that the king had no manner of inclination to withdraw either the first or the second time and that he was compelled thereto out of a principle of mere selfpreservation she farther imparted to me that the the king was so terribly possessed of his danger and so deeply afflicted when the princess anne went away that it disordered him in his understanding but that he recovered pretty well upon his return she continued that the second time he went away he so little designed any such thing that he knew not which way to set forward one while he resolved to go northward and throw himself into the hands of the lord danby another he had thoughts of going to the archbishop of canterbury or the bishop of winchester that she herself was sent to these last to know if they would receive and secure him and that they neither accepted the motion nor rejected it she told me moreover that the lords intended to make use of the marquess for the princes service but were far from intending him any advantage thereby that his lordship having been the first that advised the taking away of the charters he would be in some danger of being called to an account for it as soon as the government was well settled as well as for other articles he having great enemies among the party to which he adhered at last she desired me if possible so to contrive that she might speak to his lordship and endeavor to moderate him so far as to make him think well of a regency and not hurry on so fast for a forfeiture or abdication i told her i would do what i could in it but was sensible his lordship was too far engaged to recede the same lady again told me a great lord of scotland had but a few days before assured her that in case the two houses agreed to make the government vacant that kingdom would choose for herself be no more a province to england nor give no longer attendance at the door of an english court  the lords this day did nothing more than order the  th of february which used to be kept as the anniversary of his majestys accession to be no longer observed as a festival and sent down their resolution to the commons concerning the abdication and other matters thereto relating which the commons the day after taking into consideration they resolved to adhere totidem verbis to their first vote  sommerset the earl of burlington the earl of scarsdale and some other lords who had all been active in the princes scarsdale particularly told me the princess of denmark was very sensible of the error she had committed in leaving her father to make herself of a party with the prince who now in return was endeavoring to put her by her right and to obtain priority of succession before her  deserted and why they thought there was no vacancy the house thereupon divided the ays being     and the nos     the next day the houses had a free conference the issue of which was that the day after being the  th the lords concurred with the commons a vacancy being thus on all hands pronounced the lords proceeded to consider in what manner the throne was to be filled and in the end passed a vote that the prince and princess of orange should be proclaimed by the style and title of king william and queen mary but the commons proceeded a step farther and voted that all sanction of the laws and the negative voice should be vested in the king singly declaring it improper there should be two negatives that the succession of the crown should be to the new king and queen and to the survivor of the two then to their issue and in default thereof to the princess anne and her issue and in default of such issue to the issue of the king in case he should have any by another venture and so to the right line papists always excluded  england with all its dependancies  mean while the marquess of hallifax desired me to get the lady i just now mentioned that she then remonstrated to him that though he was so deeply at present embarked in another interest he could not be well too cautious for that the earl of danby would most certainly get the start of him and play him the same game in this court lord sunderland had in the other that all they were now doing tottered upon an uncertain foundation that scotland would most assuredly choose her own king that ireland was probably lost and gone the lord deputy tyrconnel being there at the head of an army of  0000 men and that england herself was much divided and in great distraction with much more to the same effect that his lordship himself confessed there were but small hopes of a lasting peace from this settlement though by far the best that could be formed at this time of the day and that as he was well aware of the great interest she had with the king he hoped she would upon occasion be his friend as he would be hers whenever she might stand in need of him the truth is she dealt more roundly with him than any body else could have ventured to do with so great a man but his lordship knew her well and was prepared for all she had to say telling me himself it was but prudence to lend an ear to every body  there were most certainly great and violent discontents at this time and the causes thereof were these the prince had declared he had no design upon the crown and now sought it all he could he came to settle the protestant religion and yet brought over  000 papists with him in his army a number not far short of what the king had in his but then the former were foreigners the latter for the most part english public declaration had been made that the birth of the prince of wales was false or suppositious that there was a private treaty made with france to inslave england that the murder of the late king and of the earl of essex would be amply made out and yet nothing of all this appeared excepting some small circumstances relating to the earl of essex then the prince kept his dutch forces in town while the english were marched off to remote quarters his highness declared he intended to keep his own men here and to send ours to holland and ireland the princess anne of denmark was postponed in the succession several noblemen were disappointed of posts and preferments they deservedly expected for joining with his highness because they would not vote so readily for him as he imagined in short the letters his majesty sent to the two houses were not so much as opened and trade the dutch being a frugal people seemed to be much abated in london to what it had been in the kings time these were the causes of the discontents that now broke out and appeared  the two houses having agreed upon a list of grievances and usurpations and the princess of orange being now safe arrived they both in a body attended their highnesss who sat in two chairs of state in the banqueting house whitehall where england france and ireland with all the dependancies and dominions thereunto belonging the prince in a short speech told them he did accept of the same and would do all he could for the preservation of their liberties and then went away with the princess while the heralds and several of the nobility proceeded to proclaim them king and queen in the usual form the remainder of the day was spent in joy and acclamation though some there were who had but a sorrowful countenance in the midst thereof  the chief of the articles the convention demanded redress of were suspension of the laws or their execution by the king without the consent of parliament the pretended power to dispense with laws the court of ecclesiastical commissioners the raising of money by prerogative the keeping up a standing force in times of peace without the consent of parliament the obstructions made to the free choice of members to represent the people the bars to freedom of speech in parliament and the imposition of excessive bail or fines the houses then desired the oaths of allegiance and supremacy might be suppressed and the two following taken in their stead i a b do sincerely promise and swear that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to their majestys king william and queen mary so help me god  i a b do swear that i do from my heart abhor detest and abjure as impious and heretical that damnable doctrine and position that princes excommunicated or deprived by the pope or any authority of the sea of rome may be deposed or murdered by their subjects or any other whatsoever and i do declare that no foreign prince person prelate or state has or ought to have any jurisdiction power superiority preeminence or authority ecclesiastical or civil within this realm so help me god  the days following the houses being adjourned for some time were taken up in congratulations to the new king whose numbers on this occasion were unspeakable in naming and swearing a new privy council by whose advice his majesty began first with appointing the great officers of the court and the kingdom while the grand expectation was who would have the preference hallifax or danby the latter certainly hoped to be lord treasurer but the former assured me he was disappointed and obliged to take up with the presidency of the council a place of great honor and credit but very small profit while hallifax himself was made lord privy seal of his own choice an office of great trust and worth full three thousand pounds a year before this was publicly known his lordship told me danby was down in the mouth and would not suffer his neighbors to be a little quiet about him and that for his own part as they yet stood seemingly fair together he would give him no just occasion of offense  the king being thus seated in the throne the great business was to procure such a parliament as would confirm what the convention had done and because a new election might carry some hazard with it or as was pretended might be the loss of time when the exigencies of the state required such immediate dispatch it was after great disputes between the lawyers as to the legality of the thing and warm debates in both houses agreed that the convention should be converted  and thus was a parliament obtained after an extraordinary manner it must be confessed but being thus constituted they proceeded to prepare several bills and particularly one for a comprehension and nottingham in the house of peers was seconded by some bishops though more out of fear than inclination and a third for the raising of  00000 pounds by a tax upon land  and now lord arran who had been a little before assaulted in leicesterfields by eight ruffians and had at a meeting of the scotch nobility in london proposed to recall king james was committed prisoner to the tower and many of the same nobility being on the point of setting forward for the convention in their kingdom were stopped the same day i dined with the earl of danby who treated me with more intimacy and freedom than i expected his lordship said he had made a fair report of me to the king when he gave him an account of the surprisal of york but i found him extremely cooled with regard to affairs as now managed he said that being embarked with his all he was sorry to see things no better conducted that ireland was in a manner become invincible by our neglect of sending forces thither before now that with regard to this and other material points equally unheeded he had been pressing with the king to a degree even of incivility that he had told his majesty he plainly saw he did all he could to encourage the presbyterians and to dishearten the church which could not but be absolutely prejudicial both to himself and the government though he at the same time observed that his majesty interfered but little in councils being prevented therefrom partly by inclination and partly by want of health indeed the king looked but ill and the difficulty he labored under in swallowing seemed to foretell him a man of short continuance in this world his lordship farther told me he had been appointed president of the council quite against his will after the king had declared he could not give him the staff of treasurer determined as he was that the treasury should be in the hands of commissioners that he had been offered to be secretary of state and president both at the same time and that he had declined the first that all he had asked of the king for himself was a patent to which he had a right by a former grant and that he would also be pleased to gratify some gentlemen who had upon this revolution joined him in the north in fine that the king had told him it would be by no means for his interest to be out of all business and that he had in a manner forced the presidentship upon him his lordship expressed himself doubtful of the continuance of affairs as they now stood and informed me that king james had sent down to him in the north offering to throw himself into his hands before he went away to this he said his answer was by charles bertie who brought the message that his own force which he depended upon in the north was not sufficient to trust to but that if his majesty would bring a considerable party with him and come without his papists he would sooner lose his life than he should suffer the least injury but that the king having no mind to part with his romans would not come his lordship then said that if the king would but quit his papists it might possibly not be too late yet for him he then observed that the duke of gordon a papist and governor of edinburgh castle the only magazine in scotland who was lately ready and willing to surrender it to any body now held it out obstinately for king james and that the discontents in england grew greater daily and greater he then reflected on lord hallifax the king and all about him as most strangely infatuated with notions of their own security and particularly animadverted on the last mentioned lord for insisting with such violence in a speech of his that the prince should be entitled legal and rightful king of this realm which i suppose the lord hallifax did with a view of continuing the old oaths of allegiance and supremacy and to obviate all scruple about taking the new saying it was mere nonsense for that had the prince of wales been made king he could never have been deemed our lawful sovereign while his father lived but his lordship nevertheless appeared very serious and urgent about the legality of taking the new oaths and condemned the bishops for their squeamishness in that respect though they themselves had had so large a hand in bringing about this great and extraordinary change and thereupon quoted lord nottinghams speech who in the house of lords had observed that though he had never in the least consented to this revolution but had with all his might opposed the princes accession as contrary to law yet since his highness was here and we must owe our protection to him as king de facto he thought it but just and legal to swear allegiance to him i have been the more exact in the particulars of this conversation to give the better insight into the thoughts of the greatest men upon this occasion though i wondered his lordship would venture to be so very undisguised with me but he was sure i would not betray him though even to lord hallifax  the very same day after several attempts of the sort the marquess of hallifax now again lord privy seal presented me to the king having before requested him that a young son of mine might have my company and that he might be excused from duty a year or two on account of his education but his majesty thought it an ill precedent and would give no ear to it having kissed his hand i told him i had had the honor of a trust upon me from the late king to the very last having been a stranger to his designs till i saw them in execution and that i could not then in honor or justice comply with them but that i was a firm protestant and had upon that account been a sufferer in my estate concluding that i should be strictly faithful to my duty wheresoever i served my lord hallifax then desired i might keep my company without paying any attendance to which i subjoined sir if you have resolved to take away my two governments of york and burlington i hope you will not expect i should wait on a single company his majesty said no he did not expect attendance from me which was all that passed  james had trusted with some seals and jewels that his majesty had written her word to put them into the hands of a certain person he sent for them she showed me the letter which was dated the   th of february newstile whereby i understood that he was to set out for ireland as the very next day and that he depended upon his old friends to assist him in his cause this lady told me the french king had supplied him with a great treasure of money and  000 swiss protestants that he intended to go through ireland for scotland there to call a parliament instead of the proposed convention and that from thence he would march into england and put himself entirely into the hands of the protestant interest she added that as she had a friendship for the lord privy seal she had a mind to disclose herself to him if with any safety she so might do i told her i would speak to his lordship that very night and let her know farther  having an opportunity of speaking to him accordingly i failed not to be as good as my word though i must own the topic being of so nice and tender a sort i did it with great caution however i gave him plainly to understand that the chief motive which induced the lady to desire a meeting with him was to impart to him what might be for his own good and the service of the public hereupon he began to be more free and open with me than he had hitherto been on this chapter and i told him in general that great designs were on foot he said he believed it and that though men seemed to be for the present interest as most prevalent it was not altogether discreet to venture too far that if matters really were as i had said it was but safe to carry it fair with those in the opposition and to let some people know he spoke always with great respect of king james that if we came to blows it was uncertain who would strike hardest and that he should be glad to meet the lady at my house whenever she pleased but his lordship however said all imaginable care would be taken to ward off any danger that might threaten us that an army of  0000 men would be presently raised that all suspicious persons would be secured the parliament intending to invest the king with a power to imprison whom he pleased and to keep them in safe custody till they came to a trial and in fine that the parliament would most plentifully furnish the king for the prosecution of the war at this time several lords and gentlemen of both houses withdrew to their several countries and i was told that some who were outwardly great friends to the present government were treating for terms on the other side which i communicated to his lordship and particularly made mention of some he little suspected whereupon his lordship said that if king james was actually driving on at the rate reported the papists would certainly contrive some how or other to assassinate or kill king william well knowing what a task it would be to defend the crown on the head of a woman with much more to the same effect  i waited on lord bellassis first commissioner of the treasury under the late king who told me that though he was himself a papist he had been quite averse to the measures which had been taken to promote the catholic religion but that his council never had weight the warmones having insinuated to the king that it came from a man old and timorous who having a great estate did not care to run any hazard of it he then observed that as there was such a number of great men combined in this revolt it was almost impossible to think the king being a papist as he was should ever again be restored but that if he would but be a protestant it would certainly happen in a very short time this lord was very deservedly esteemed one of the wisest men of his party  james and even those who did comply did it as a local and temporary duty naturally resulting from the protection they owed to king william and queen mary this day lord hallifax met the lady i just now mentioned to have received a letter from king james she dealt very frankly with him but durst not tell him all she knew however he desired her to be his friend if any alteration of affairs should by any means be brought to pass  now the two houses had some days before voted to stand by king william and queen mary with their lives and fortunes the commons had completed the bill for laying a tax upon land and deliberated on other ways for levying of money for the crown as well to raise men as to supply the loss of that branch of the revenue called hearthmoney which they were by an act for that purpose taking quite away as troublesome to collect and oppressive in its nature while the fears greatly and greatly increased that king james was actually in ireland and that scotland would not fail to take his part wherefore commissions were given out for the raising of  0000 foot and twenty shillings advance allowed to every man but notwithstanding this encouragement and though the colonels were most of them men of quality and great interest it was much apprehended the intended troops would not be easily collected together the french king had for his irish expedition furnished king james with a squadron of    men of war   lesser frigates and   fireships all well manned and fitted as also with a sum of  00000 l in ready money and  0000 pistoles as a present for his pocket together with plate tents and a most royal and splendid equipage he assisted him also with eight experienced field officers one hundred of inferior note a guard of one hundred swiss a band of skilful pioneers   000 of his own natural subjects arms for  0000 men more cannon and ammunition in a great abundance and over and above made him an offer of   000 of his french troops but king james cused himself upon this head saying he would succeed by the help of his own subjects or perish in the attempt in the midst of this threatening danger lord hallifax told me the the commons were still bent upon pursuing him and lord danby and that some of them had declared they would give no more money till the king had dismissed them and some other of his officers but says his lordship the king is not to be wrought upon as they may imagine he is very well able to defend himself they were angry with this nobleman for advising king charles ii to take away the charter of the city of london and for opposing the bill of exclusion but i told him it was quite foolish for men who had raised a new fabric immediately to pull down the main support of it his lordship said he was very little sollicitous whether they succeeded in their attempt or not and that it would be no great mortification to him if he did surrender his place his lordship then begged of me to endeavor a reconciliation between him and a lady i had formerly brought to him about some business wherein she thought herself ill used for that she had a good interest with king jame  james if but a protestant could not be kept out four months nay lord danby went farther and averred that if he would but give us satisfaction as to our religion as he easily might it would be very hard to make head against him sayings which i thought very extraordinary to fall from such great men dunbartons regiment which he had long since brought out of france and was now quartered at ipswich being all scotch and consisting of   00 men chose rather to march off in a body with their arms and four pieces of cannon toward scotland than obey orders which were to embark and sail for holland lord privy seal doing me the honor of a visit this day told me the king had sent two regiments of dutch horse and one of dragoons after them that if the scotch regiment had done this without confederacy they were all lost but that if any other of our forces were in the secret and under engagement to join and support them there might be danger in the thing i now perceived his lordship to be very uneasy that danby under pretense of illness so much absented himself from business and very much displeased that some very little qualifyed had so wonderfully by his means got into posts of consequence and particularly that lord willoughby a very young man and quite a stranger to business should be the chancellor of the exchequer i told his lordship i wondered much more that lord mordaunt who never saw a hundred pounds together of his own should pretend to be the first commissioner of the treasury i then dealt very freely with him as to the apparent uncertainty of the times desired him to be cautious and circumspect and assured him i wished his safety and his familys as much as my own his lordship then observed among other things that the king used no arts to which i replied that in my opinion some arts were necessary in our government i think so too said he we act a little too plainly i acquainted his lordship with some particulars which caused a murmuring in the town and of some which caused the same in the country whereupon he said come sir john we have wives and children we must consider them and not venture too far he then proceeded to intimate that if a change should happen there would be a general pardon though said he i hear there is one which creeps up and down wherein i am excepted but said he as you know i gave you some oblique hints of what was likely to be brought about though so obscure that i must own i did not take them so you must let me know what you hear on the other side and indeed i loved him so well that i was always ready enough to communicate to him whatever i heard relating either to the public or his own private service provided i did thereby no prejudice to any particular person or incurred the guilt of betraying what was told me in pure confidence  scotch regiment had submitted themselves to the kings mercy that their officers would have persuaded them to fight though the dutch were four times their number and that they were in confederacy with others who as it happened did not dare to lift up their heads his lordship continued that there was now great hopes of scotland and indeed the kirk party which declared for king william was by much the strongest there king james appeared too late in ireland but he had this to plead the winds would not permit him to stir out of breast sooner than he did the church of england was now furiously driven at by some in both houses king william being seemingly a greater friend to calvinism in the house of lords it was strongly debated charles ii and in the house of commons it was stiffly contended that the king in his coronation oath should not particularly bind himself to the church of england as by law established but both these points being carried in favor of the church evinced her interest to be stronger than any other in parliament and would as it was thought induce the king to court her a little more than he had done  the affairs of all europe were now seemingly at a stand though preparations were every where making for war the empire was mustering up all her quotas against france on the one hand and the turk on the other spain betrayed a willingness to side with the emperor sweden holland and england were ready to do the same while denmark seemed to be fixed to a neutrality the pope was still in anger with france though she did all she could to mollify him pretending to blow up the flames of a religious war but this was not to serve the purpose at present his holiness thinking the king of france was grown too big for his neighbors and that therefore regard was to be had chiefly now for his temporals the church was out of the question the world was now uppermost and conscience was pusilanimity and indolence according to the known and avowed maxims of the roman creed  it happened this day that i met with the davids who asked if i thought hallifax the house voted this answer to be not satisfactory but thought it unadvisable to pursue the point too far sensible of the ill blood that had been set on float by the late severity of usage toward the episcopal order a day or two afterward the church of england carried a second vote in the house of commons and indeed it was high time for her sons to exert themselves the dissenters having not only prevailed that the oaths meant for her security some prayers in the liturgy and certain ceremonies should be altered or dispensed with but a motion had likewise been made that there might be some alteration in the very creed in a few days afterward a very extraordinary debate arose in both houses between the dissenters and the members of the church the former pushing their act of comprehension and toleration farther than the latter were willing it should go they were almost equally matched and sometimes one carried a vote in both houses and sometimes the other  james was now in ireland and intended for scotland though the kirk party in the convention of that kingdom were for opposing him money was at this time very scarce at court and yet great preparations were daily making for the coronation of king william and queen mary but though necessaries were certainly wanting for the army the court and the due support of the government it was not that the parliament was backward in giving but the money could not be raised soon enough the city refusing to advance any money upon the acts that were passed for great discontents were visible to every eye which seemed rather to increase daily than to diminish  england was a sufferer she might thank her self for it her pretenses being too large that the commons were so slow in their proceedings that it looked as if they thought the whole world was confined to westminster that the king also was very dilatory to the great hindrance of business though dispatch could at no time be ever more required his lordship continued that there was a necessity for acting with so many fools that they alone were wise who had nothing to do and moreover that he had heard there were some irish landed in scotland that scotland however would give them but a cool reception that king james had nothing to depend on here but the army which would be so disposed of as to be unable to do any thing for him and that if he came not very soon he would be disappointed of this his only hope he concurred with me that the earl of danby had procured the government of hull as a place of retreat where he might make his own terms in case of a change of the times and assured me he was more afraid of the consequences of king williams cough which increased upon him with great violence than of any thing else i must confess i upon this occasion temporised a little it being neither safe nor prudent to be too open with a privy councellor and so great a minister especially as i had been guilty of freedoms with his lordship to little or no purpose though whenever he asked me my opinion i never failed to deal uprightly with him  but now let us take a view of the coronation banquet to which i among other friends had the honor of being admitted as well as to be with them throughout the whole of the show so that i had a very fair opportunity of seeing all that past the bishop of london crowned them both assisted by the bishop of salisbury the late doctor burnet who preached the sermon and two others a few days afterward being with lord privy seal the bishop of salisbury came in and complained heavily of the slow proceedings of the house of commons saying the dutch would clap up a peace with france if they did not mend their pace observed that the church of england was in the fault and expressed himself as if he thought they meant a kindness to king james by their method of procedure lord privy seal agreed with him in his sentiments and added that the church people hated the dutch and had rather turn papists than receive the presbyterians among them but that on the other hand these were to the full as rank and inveterate against those and would mar all their business by their inadvertance with regard to their bill of comprehension and their illtiming of other bills in short that they would disgust those from whom they looked for indulgence they were both angry with the commons address to the king the day before desiring him to support and defend the church of england according to his former declaration and to call a convocation of the clergy which the bishop said would be the utter ruin of the comprehension scheme in fine the marquess took notice that at the rate we proceeded the government could not but be very short lived  king james was all this while in ireland the convention of scotland opposing him with might and main and declaring the throne of their kingdom to be vacant presently after we had advice that they had voted william and mary to be king and queen of scotland converted their convention into a parliament and invited the english forces on their borders to come into their kingdom to be ready to assist them against king james and his friends but at the same time that they had prepared certain conditions and drawn up a list of certain grievances for the king to redress and assent to and particularly that episcopacy should no longer have being in scotland and that the king should with regard to them embrace the presbyterian persuasion the duke of gordon however still kept the castle of edinburgh  at home the parliament was taken up with raising of money and the commons address the king to declare war with france and promise him all the needful supplies but great heats broke out between the two houses about the oath bill the lords being willing to excuse the bishops convinced that several of them would forfeit their sees rather than comply while the commons urged that no soul should be excused but as widely as they for the present differed about this they concurred in the bill for the toleration of all protestant dissenters the next day the king gave a favorable england and moved him for a convocation a day or two after he returned answer to the commons address that he would declare war with france telling them he complied with their request and the rather as the french king had in a manner begun and assured them that whatever money they gave should be faithfully applied to the desired end  about this time a very sad accident happened which for a while was the discourse of the whole town mr temple son to sir william temple who had married a french lady with  0000 pistoles a sedate and accomplished young gentleman who had lately by king william been made secretary of war took a pair of oars and drawing near the bridge leapt into the thames and drowned himself leaving a note behind him in the boat to this effect my folly in undertaking what i could not perform whereby some misfortunes have befallen the kings service is the cause of my putting my self to this sudden end i wish him success in all his undertakings and a better servant a dangerous thing it is for some constitutions to give way to discontent and imaginary notion but not to digress on this melancholy subject  the parliament proceeded to raise money but upon terms and persons that gave great dissatisfaction the poll was quite strict scarce a soul being exempted therefrom but such as received alms the house consenting to a grant of no less than four millions for one year only and now lord hallifax told me that the marquess of caermarthens retirement into the country his pretenses to be sick and his so seldom appearing at court instilled fresh jealousies of him that he had heard he should say things could not long continue thus that his relations and friends were very dangerous in in their discourse and that he himself was very open that he found this new marquess had no mind to be inward or intimate with him that he supposed his lordship might imagine he had kept him at a distance from the treasurers staff but that imagine what he would he did not altogether deserve it that of all men in the world the king never would have invested him with that office nor indeed with any other that was very considerable as he would find if affairs but held out till september hereupon i acquainted his lordship with some grounds that made it suspected the president was discontented his lordship then continued that for his own part he found the king very well affected toward himself that his majesty did not only carry it fair to him personally but that from third hands he had it that the king used very kind expressions of him behind his back for that he gave him but very little trouble either on account of himself or of other people while the lord president knew no end of his importunities this urged me to say that i did not know what his lordship might thereby be a loser with the king but that he gained much with others i was certain for that it was a common saying no lord used his good offices for his countrymen but the lord president and this i observed because the lord privy seal though otherwise very kind and free with me did not espouse my interest as i expected he would but his lordship farther told me that the king being so very inaccessible as he was and confining himself so to hampton when there was such absolute need of the most stirring action was the destruction of all business that he had desired his majesty but to lie sometimes in town and that his answer was it was not to be done except his lordship desired to see him dead which said my lord was a very short answer to conclude he proceeded to say that if the king survived this summer which he thought he fairly might notwithstanding his consumptive diforder or escaped the murderous hands of the papists he doubted not but the government would stand firm though it devolved to the queen singly but that however the concern he had for his family would naturally tempt him to act with all the moderation that might be that upon this consideration it was he had taken no great or additional places no new honors no blue ribbon as others had done  the next day i was to go to hampton court where his lordship was to meet me and present me to the king before i went into the country his lordship repeated his promises to do for me what he could but said it would be but discretion to let two or three months pass overhead before i pressed matters too much to the end we might the better see what was likely to become of things  finis
