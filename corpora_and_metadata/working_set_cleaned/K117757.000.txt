that they will not expect this month to hear any great good either of giles himself his wife rachel of any of their family i am sorry to expose their tricks but it is their fault not mine if i pretend to speak about people at all i must tell the truth i am sure if folks would but turn about and mend it would be a thousand times pleasanter to me to write their histories for it is no comfort to tell of any bodys faults if the world would but grow good i should be glad enough to tell of it but till it really becomes so i must go on describing it as it is otherwise i should only mislead my readers instead of instructing them  as to giles and his boys i am sure old widow brown has good reason to remember their dexterity poor woman she had a fine little bed of onions in her neat and wellkept garden she was very fond of her onions and many a rheumatism has she caught by kneeling down to weed them in a damp day notwithstanding the little flannel cloak and the bit of an old mat which madam wilson gave her because the old woman would needs weed in wet weather her onions she always carefully treasured up for her winters store for an onion makes a little broth very relishing and is indeed the only savoury thing poor people are used to get she had also a small orchard containing about a dozen apple trees with which in a good year she has been known to make a couple of barrels of cider which she sold to her landlord toward paying her rent besides having a little keg which she was able to keep back for her own drinking well would you believe it giles and his boys marked both onions and apples for their own indeed a man who stole so many rabbits from the warren was likely enough to steal onions for sauce one day when the widow was abroad on a little business giles and his boys made a clear riddance of the onion bed and when they had pulled up every single onion they then turned a couple of pigs into the garden who allured by the smell tore up the bed in such a manner that the widow when she came home had not the least doubt but the pigs had been the thieves to confirm this opinion they took care to leave the little hatch half open at one end of the garden and to break down a bit of a fence at the other end  i wonder how any body can find in his heart not to pity and respect poor old widows there is something so forlorn and helpless in their condition that methinks it is a call on every body men women and children to do them all the kind services that fall in their way surely their having no one to take their part is an additional reason for kindhearted people not to hurt and oppress them but it was this very reason which led giles to do this woman an hurt  it happened unluckily for this poor widow that her cottage stood quite alone on several mornings together for roguery gets up much earlier than industry giles and his boys stole regularly into her orchard followed by their jackasses she was so deaf that she could not hear the asses if they had brayed ever so loud and to this giles trusted so he was very cautious in his rogueries since he could not otherwise have contrived to keep out of prison for though he was almost always suspected he had seldom been taken up and never convicted the boys used to fill their bags load their asses and then march off and if in their way to the town where the apples were to be sold they chanced to pass by one of their neighbors who might be likely to suspect them they then all at once began to scream out buy my coal  buy my sand  besides the trees in her orchard poor widow brown had in her small garden one apple tree particularly fine it was a redstreak so tempting and so lovely that giless family had watched it with longing eyes till at last they resolved on a plan for carrying off all this fine fruit in their bags but it was a nice point to manage the tree stood directly under her chamberwindow so that there was some danger that she might spy them at the work they therefore determined to wait till the next sunday morning when they knew she would not fail to be at church sunday came and during service giles attended it was a lone house as i said before and the rest of the parish were safe at church in a trice the tree was cleared the bags were filled the asses were whipped the thieves were off the coast was clear and all was safe and quiet by the time the sermon was over  unluckily however it happened that this tree was so beautiful and the fruit so fine that the people as they used to pass to and from church were very apt to stop and admire widow browns redstreak and some of the farmers rather envied her that in that scarce season when they hardly expected to make a pie out of a large orchard she was likely to make cider from a single tree i am afraid indeed if i must speak out she herself rather set her heart too much upon this tree and had folt as much pride as gratitude to a good providence for it but this failing of here is was no excuse for giles the covetousness of this thief had for once got the better of his caution the tree was too completely stripped though the youngest boy dick did beg hard that his father would leave the poor old woman enough for a few dumplings and when giles ordered dick in his turn to shake the tree the boy did it so gently that hardly any apples fell for which he got a good shake of the stick with which the old man was beating down the apples  the neighbors on their return from church stopped as usual but it was  not alas to admire the apples for apples there were none left but to lament the robbery and console the widow mean time the redstreaks were safely lodged in giless hovel under a few bundles of hay which he had contrived to pull from the farmers mow the night before for the use of his jack asses such a stir however began to be made about the widows apple tree that giles who knew how much his character laid him open to suspicion as soon as he saw the people safe in church again in the afternoon ordered his boys to carry each a hatful of the apples and thrust them in at a little casement window which happened to be open in the house of samuel price a very honest carpenter in that parish who was at church with his whole family giless plan by this contrivance was to lay the thest on prices sons in case the thing should come to be further enquired into here dick put in a word and begged and prayed his father not to force them to carry the apples to prices but all that he by his begging was such a knock as had nearly laid him on the earth what you cowardly rascal said giles you will go and peach i suppose and get your father sent to goal  poor widow brown though her trouble had made her still weaker than she was went to church again in the afternoon indeed she rightly thought that trouble was a new reason why she ought to go during the service she tried with all her might not to think of her redstreaks and whenever they would come into her head she took up her prayer book directly and so she forgot them a little and indeed she found herself much easier when she came out of the church than when she went in now it happened oddly enough that on that sunday of all the sundays in the year she should call in to rest a little at samuel prices to tell over again the lamentable story of the apples and to consult with him how the thief might be brought to justice but o reader guess if you can for i am sure i cannot tell you what was her surprise when on going into samuel prices kitchen she saw her own redstreaks lying in the window the apples were of a sort too remarkable for color shape and size to be mistaken there was not such another tree in the parish widow brown immediately screamed out lassaday as sure as can be here are my redstreaks i could swear to them in any court samuel price who believed his sons to be as honest as himself was shocked and troubled at the sight he knew he had no redstreaks of his own he knew there were no apples in the window when he went to church he did verily believe them to be the widows but how they came there he could not possibly guess he called for tom the only one his sons who now lived at home tom was at the sunday school which he had never once missed since mr wilson  minister had set up one in the parish was  boy likely to do such a deed  a crowd was by this time got about price  among which was giles and his bos who had already taken care to spread the news that tom price was the thief most people were unwilling to believe it his character was very good  appearances were strongly against him mr wilson who had staid to christen a child now  in he was much concerned that tom price the best boy in his school should stand accused of such a crime he sent for the boy examined and cross examined him no marks of guilt appeared but still though he pleaded not guilty there lay the redstreaks in his fathers window all the idle fellows in the place who were likely to have mitted such a theft themselves fell with great vengeance on poor tom the wicked seldom give any quarter this is one of your sanctified ones cried they this was all the good that sunday schools did for their parts they never saw any good come by religion sunday was the only day for a little pastime and if poor boys must be shut up with their godly books when they ought to be out taking a little pleasure it was no wonder they made themselves amends by such tricks another said he should like to see parson wilsons righteous one well whipped a third hoped he would be clapped in the stocks for a young hypocrite as he was while old giles who thought to avoid suspicion by being more violent than the rest declared that he hoped the young dog would be transported for life  mr wilson was too wise and too just to proceed against tom without full proof he declared the crime was a very heavy one and he feared that heavy must be the punishment tom who knew his own innocence earnestly prayed to god that it might be made to appear as dear as the noonday and very servent were his secret devotions on that night  black giles passed his night in a very different manner he set off as soon as it was dark with his sons and their jackasses laden with their stolen goods as such a cry was raised about the apples he did not think it safe to keep them longer at home but resolved to go and sell them at the next town borrowing without leave a lame colt out of the moor to assist in carrying off his booty  giles and his eldest sons had rare sport all the way in thinking that while they were enjoying the profit of their plunder tom price would be whipped round the market place at least if not sent beyond sea but the younger boy dick who had naturally a tender heart though hardened by his long familiarity with sin could not help crying when he thought that tom price might perhaps be transported for a crime which he himself had helped to commit he had had no compunction about the robbery for he had not been instructed in the great principles of truth and justice nor would he therefore perhaps have had much remorse about accusing an innocent boy but though utterly devoid of principle he had some remains of natural feeling and of gratitude tom price had often given him a bit of his own bread and cheese and once when dick was like to be drowned tom had jumped into the pond with his clothes on and saved his life when he was just sinking the remembrance of all this made his heart heavy he said nothing as he trotted bare foot after the asses he heard his father and brothers laugh at having outwitted the godly ones and he grieved to think how poor tom would suffer for his wickedness yet sear kept him silent they called him sulky dog and lashed the asses till they bled  in the mean time tom price kept up his spirits as well as he could he worked hard all day and prayed heartily night and morning it is true said he to himself i am not guilty of this sin but let this accusation set me on examining myself and truly repenting of all my other sins for i find enough to repent of though i thank god i did not steal those apples  at length sunday came tom went to school as usual as soon as he walked in there was a deal of whispering and laughing among the worst of the boys and he over heard them say who would have thought it this is masters favorite this is parson wilsons sober tommy we shall not have tommy thrown in our teeth again if we go to get a birds nest or gather a few nuts of a sunday your demure ones are always hypocrites says another the still sow sucks all the milk says a third  giless family had always kept clear of the school dick indeed had sometimes wished to go not that he had much sense of sin or desire after goodness but he thought if he could once read he might rise in the world and not be forced to drive asses all his life through this whole saturday night he could not sleep he longed to know what would be done to tom he began to wish to go to school but he had not courage sin is very cowardly so on the sunday morning he went and sat himself down under the church wall mr wilson passed by it was not his way to reject the most wicked till he had tried every means to bring them over and even then he pitied and prayed for them he had indeed long left off talking to giless sons but seeing dick sitting by himself he once more spoke to him desired him to leave off his vagabond life and go with him into the school the boy hung down his head but made no answer he did not however either rise up and run away or look sulky as he used to do the minister desired him once more sir said the boy i cannot go i am so big i am ashamed the bigger you are the less time you have to lose but sir i cannot read then it is high time you should learn i should be ashamed to begin to learn my letters the shame is not in beginning to learn them but in being contented never to know them but sir i am so ragged god looks at the heart and not at the coat but sir i have no shoes and stockings so much the worse i remember who gave you both here dick colored it is bad to want shoes and stockings but still if you can drive your asses a dozen miles without them you may certainly walk to school without them but sir the good boys will hate me and will not speak to me good boys hate nobody and as to not speaking to you to be sure they will not keep you company while you go on in your present evil courses but as soon as they see you wish to reform they will help you and pity you and teach you and so come along here mr wilson took this dirty boy by the hand and gently pulled him forward kindly talking to him all the way  how the whole school stared to see dick giles come in no one however dared to say what he thought the business went on and dick slunk into a corner partly to hide his rags and partly to hide his sin for last sundays transaction sat heavy at his heart not because be had stolen the apples but because tom price had been accused this i say made him slink behind poor boy he little thought there was one saw him who sees all things and from whole eye no hole nor corner can hide the sinner  it was the custom in that school for the master who was a good and wise man to mark down in his pocket book all the events of the week that he might turn them to some account in his sunday evening instructions such as any useful story in the newspaper any account of boys being drowned as they were out in a pleasureboat on sundays any sudden death in the parish or any other remarkable visitation of providence insomuch that many young people in the place who did not belong to the school and many parents also used to drop in for an hour on a sunday evening when they were sure to hear something profitable the minister greatly approved this practice and often called in himself which was a great support to the master and encouragement to the people  the master had taken a deep concern in the story of widow browns apple tree he could not believe tom price was guilty nor dared he pronounce him innocent but he resolved to turn the instructions of the present evening to this subject he began thus my dear boys however light some of you may make of robbing an orchard yet i have often told you there is no such thing as a little sin if it be wilful or habitual i wish now to explain to you also that there is hardly such a thing as a single solitary sin you know i teach you not merely to repeat the commandments as an exercise for your memory but as a rule for your conduct if you were to come here only to learn to read and spell on a sunday i should think that was not employing gods day for gods work but i teach you to read that you may by this means come so to understand the bible and the catechism as to make every text in the one and every question and answer in the other to be so fixed in your hearts that they may bring forth the fruits of good living  master how many commandments are there   boy ten   master how many did that boy break who stole widow browns apples   boy only one master the eighth   master what is the eighth   boy thou shall not steal   master and you are very sure that this was the only one he broke now suppose i could prove to you that he probably broke not less than six out of those ten commandments which the great lord of heaven himself stooped down from his eternal glory to deliver to men would you not then think it a terrible thing to steal whether apples or guineas   boy yes master   master i will put the case some wicked boy has robbed widow browns orchard here the eyes of every one were turned on poor tom price except those of dick giles who fixed his on the ground i accuse no one continued the master tom price is a good boy and was not missing at the time of the robbery these are two reasons why i presume he is innocent but whoever it was you allow that by stealing these apples he broke the eighth commandment   boy yes master   master on what day were these apples stolen   boy on sunday   master what is the fourth commandment   boy thou shall keep holy the sabbath day   master does that person keep holy the sabbath day who loiters in an orchard on sunday when he should be at church and steals apples when he ought to be saying his prayers   boy no master   master what command does he break   boy the fourth   master suppose this boy had parents who had sent him to church and that he had disobeyed them by not going would that be keeping the fifth commandment   boy no master for the fifth commandment says thou shall honor thy father and thy mother  this was the only part of the case in which poor dick giless heart did not sinite him for he knew that he had disobeyed no father for his father alas was still wickeder than himself and had brought him to commit the sin but what a wretched comfort was this the master went on   master suppose this boy earnestly coveted this fruit though it belonged to another person would that be right   boy no master for the tenth commandment says thou shall not covet   master very well here are four of gods positive commands already broken now do you think thieves ever scruple to use wicked words   boy i am afraid not master   here dick giles was not so hardened but that he remembered how many curses had passed between him and his father while they were filling the bags and he was afraid to look up the master went on  i will now go one step further if the thief to all his other sins has added that of accusing the innocent to save himself if he should break the ninth commandment by bearing false witness against a harmless neighbor six commandments are broken for an apple but if it be otherwise if tom price should be found guilty it is not his good character shall save him i shall shed tears over him but punish him i must  no that you shall not roared out dick giles who sprung from his hiding place fell on his knees and burst out a crying tom price is as good a boy as ever lived it was father and i stole the apples  it would have done your heart good to have seen the joy of the master the modest blushes of tom price and the satisfaction of every honest boy in the school all shook hands with tom and even dick got some portion of pity i wish i had room to give my readers the moving exhortation which the master gave but while mr wilson left the guilty boy to the management of the master he thought it became him as a minister and a magistrate to go to the extent of the law in punishing the father early on the monday morning he sent to apprehend giles in the mean time mr wilson was sent for to a gardeners house two miles distant to attend a man who was dying this was a duty to which all others gave way in his mind he set out directly but what was his surprise on his arrival to see on a littlebed on the floor poaching giles lying in all the agonies of death jack weston the same poor young man against whom giles had informed for killing a hare was kneeling by him offering him some broth and talking to him in the kindest manner mr wilson begged to know the meaning of all this and jack weston spoke as follow  at four this morning as i was going out to now passing under the high wall of this garden i heard a most dismal moaning the nearer i came the more dismal it grew at last who should i see but poor giles groaning and struggling under a quantity of bricks and stones but not able to stir the day before he had marked a fine large net on this old wall and resolved to steal it for he thought it might do as well to catch partridges as to preserve cherries so sir standing on the very top of this wall and tugging with all his might to loosen the net from the hooks which fastened it down came giles net wall and all for the wall was gone to decay it was very high indeed and poor giles not only broke his thigh but has got a terrible blow on his brain and is bruised all over like a mummy on seeing me sir poor giles cried out oh jack i did try to ruin thee by lodging that information and now thou will be revenged by letting me lie here and perish god forbid gil  cried i thou shall see what sort of revenge a christian takes so sir i sent off the gardeners boy to fetch a surgeon while i scampered home and brought on my back this bit of a hammock which is indeed my own bed and put giles upon it we then lifted him up bed and all as tenderly as if he had been a gentleman and brought him in here my wife has just brought him a drop of nice broth and now sir as i have done what i could for his poor perishing body it was i who took the liberty to send to you to come to try to help his poor soul for the doctor says he cannot live  mr wilson could not help saying to himself such an action as this is worth a whole volume of comments on that precept of our blessed master do good to them that hate you giless dying groans confirmed the sad account weston had just given the poor wretch could neither pray himself nor attend to the minister he could only cry out oh sir what will become of me i dont know how to repent oh my poor wicked children sir i have bred them all up in sin and ignorance have mercy on them sir let me not meet than in the place of torment to which i am going he languished a few days and died in great misery  except the minister and jack weston no one came to see poor giles besides tommy price who had been so sadly wronged by him tom often brought him his own rice milk or apple dumpling and giles ignorant and depraved as he was often cried out that he thought now there must be some truth in religion since it taught even a boy to deny himself and to forgive an injury  mr wilson the next sunday made a moving discourse on the danger of what are called petty offenses this together with the awful death of giles produced such an effect that no poacher has been able to show his head in that parish ever since  z  the end
