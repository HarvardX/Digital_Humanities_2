an essay upon nursing and the management of children from their birth to three years of age  by a physician  in a letter to one of the governors of the foundling hospital  published by order of the general committee for transacting the affairs of the said hospital  the second edition  london printed for j roberts in warwick lane mdccxlviii  price   d  sir it is with great pleasure i see at last the preservation of children become the care of men of sense it is certainly a matter that well deserves their attention and i doubt not the public will soon find the good and great effects of it the foundling hospital may be of more use to the world than was perhaps at first imagined by the promoters of it it will be a means not only of preventing the murder of many but of saving more by introducing a more reasonable and more natural method of nursing in my opinion this business has been too long fatally left to the management of women who cannot be supposed to have proper knowledge to fit them for such a task notwithstanding they look upon it to be their own province what i mean is a philosophic knowledge of nature to be acquired only by learned observation and experience and which therefore the unlearned must be incapable of they may presume upon the examples and transmitted customs of their great grandmothers who were taught by the physicians of their unenlightend days when physicians as appears by late discoveries were mistaken in many things being led away be hypothetical reasonings to entertain very wild conceits in which they were greatly bewildered themselves and misled others to believe i know not what strange unaccountable powers in certain herbs roots and drugs and also in some superstitious practices and ceremonies for all which notions there being no real foundation in nature they ought to be looked upon as the effects of ignorance or the artifices of designing quacks who found their account by pretending to great knowledge in these occult qualities and imposing upon the credulous the art of physic has been much improved within this last century by observing and following nature more closely many useful discoveries have been made which help us to account for things in a natural way that before seemed mysterious and magical and which have consequently made the practice of it more conformable to reason and good sense this being the case there is great room to fear that those nurses who yet retain many of these traditional prejudices are capitally mistaken in their management of children in general and fancying that nature has left a great deal to their skill and contrivance often do much harm where they intend to do good of this i shall endeavor to convince them by showing how i think children may be clothed fed and managed with much less trouble to their nurses and infinitely greater ease and comfort to the little ones  the foundlings under the care of the hospital i presume will be bred in a very plain simple manner they will therefore infallibly have the more health beauty strength and spirits i might add understanding too as all the faculties of the mind are well known to depend upon the organs of the body so that when these are in good order the thinking part is most alert and active the contrary when they are disturbed or diseased when these advantages appear in favor of children so brought up as i am confident in time they will it may serve to convince most nurses aunts grandmothers etc how much they have hitherto been in the wrong what mischief is done to children and what multitudes are destroyed or spoiled as well by cramming them with cakes sweetmeats etc till they foul their blood choke their vessels pall the appetite and ruin every faculty of their bodies as by cockering and indulging them to the utter perversion of their naturally good temper till they become quite froward and indocile  when a man takes upon him to contradict received opinions and prejudices sanctified by time it is expected he should bring valid proof of what he advances the truth of what i say that the treatment of children in general is wrong unreasonable and unnatural will in great measure appear if we but consider what a puny valetudinary race most of our people of condition are chiefly owing to bad nursing and bad habits contracted early but let any one who would be fully convinced of this matter look over the bills of mortality there he may observe that almost half the number of those who fill up that black list die under five years of age so that half the people that come into the world go out of it again before they become of the least use to it or themselves to me this seems to deserve serious consideration and yet i cannot find that any one man of sense and public spirit has ever attended to it at all notwithstanding the maxim in every ones mouth that a multitude of inhabitants is the greatest strength and best support of a commonwealth the misconduct to which i must impute a great part of the calamity is too common and obvious to engage the idle and speculative who are to be caught only by very refined researches and the busy part of mankind where their immediate interest is not concerned will always overlook what they see daily it may be thought a natural evil and so is submitted to without examination but this is by no means the case and where it is entirely owing to mismanagement and possibly may admit of a remedy it is ridiculous to charge it upon nature and suppose that infants are more subject to disease and death than grown persons on the contrary they bear pain and disease much better fevers especially as is plain in the case of the smallpox generally most favorable to children and for the same reason that a twig is less hurt by a storm than an oak in all the other productions of nature we see the greatest vigor and luxuriancy of health the nearer they are to the egg or the bud they are indeed then most sensible of injury and it is injury only that destroys them when was there a lamb a bird or a tree that died because it was young these are under the immediate nursing of unerring nature and they thrive accordingly ought it not therefore to be the care of every nurse and every parent not only to protect their nurselings from injury but to be well assured that their own officious services be not the greatest the helpless creatures can suffer  in the lower class of mankind especially in the country disease and mortality are not so frequent either among the adult or their children health and posterity are the portion of the poor i mean the laborious the want of superfluity confines them more within the limits of nature hence they enjoy blessings they feel not and are ignorant of their cause the mother who has only a few rags to cover her child loosely and little more than her own breast to feed it sees it healthy and strong and very soon able to shift for itself while the puny infect the heir and hope of a rich family lies langushing under a load of finery that overpowers his limbs abhorring and rejecting the dainties he is crammed with till he dies a victim to the mistaken care and tenderness of his fond mother in the course of my practice i have had frequent occasion to be fully satisfied of this and have often heard a mother anxiously say the child has not been well ever since it has done puking and crying these complaints though not attended to point very plainly to their cause is it not very evident that when a child rids its stomach several times in a day that it has been overloaded when it cries from the encumbrance and confinement of its clothes that it is hurt by them while the natural strength lasts as every child is born with more health and strength than is generally imagined it cries at or rejects the superfluous load and thrives apace that is grows very fat bloted and distended beyond measure like a houselamb but in time the same oppressive cause continuing the natural powers are overcome being no longer able to throw off the unequal weight the child now not able to cry any more languishes and is quiet the misfortune is these complaints are not understood it is swadled and crammed on till after gripes purging etc it sinks under both burdens into a convulsion fit and escapes any further torture this would be the case with the lamb was it not killed when it is full fat  that the present method of nursing is wrong one would think needed no other proof than the frequent miscarriages attending it the death of many and ill health of those that survive but the persuading you of it may be a needless task if you have ever thought about it i doubt not but you are already convinced it is so however since you desire my sentiments upon the subject taking it for granted you think with me that most of our nurses are got into a wrong method i will endeavor in as few words as possible to tell you what i think a right one  you perceive sir by the hints i have already dropped what i am going to complain of is that children in general are overcloathd and overfed and fed and clothed improperly to these causes i impute almost all their diseases but to be a little more explicit the first great mistake is that they think a newborn infant cannot be kept too warm from this prejudice they load and bind it with flannels wrappers swaths stays etc commonly called clothes which all together are almost equal to its own weight by which means a healthy child in a months time is made so tender and chilly it cannot bear the external air and if by any accident of a door or window left carelessly open too long a refreshing breeze be admitted into the suffocating atmosphere of the lyingin bedchamber the child and mother sometimes catch irrecoverable colds but what is worse than this at the end of the month if things go on apparently well this hotbed plant is sent out into the country to be reared in a leaky house that lets in wind and rain from every quarter is it any wonder the child never thrives afterward the truth is a newborn child cannot well be too cool and loose in its dress it wants less clothing than a grown person in proportion because it is naturally warmer as appears by the thermometer and would therefore bear the cold of a winters night much better than any adult person whatever there are many instances both ancient and modern of infants exposed and deserted that have lived several days as it was the practice of ancient times in many parts of the world to expose all those whom the parents did not care to be encumbered with that were deformed or born under evil stars not to mention the many foundlings picked up in london streets these instances may serve to show that nature has made children able to bear even great hardships before they are made weak and sickly by their mistaken nurses but besides the mischief arising from the weight and heat of these swaddlingcloaths they are put on so tight and the child is so cramped by them that its bowels have not room nor the limbs any liberty to act and exert themselves in the free easy manner they ought this is a very hurtful circumstance for limbs that are not used will never be strong and such tender bodies cannot bear much pressure the circulation restrained by the compression of any one part must produce unnatural swellings in some other especially as the fibers of infants are so easily distended to which doubtless are owing the many distortions and deformities we meet with every where chiefly among women who suffer more in this particular than the men i would recommend the following dress a little flannel waistcoat without sleeves made to fit the body and tie loosely behind to which there should be a petticoat sewed and over this a kind of gown of the same material or any other that is light thin and flimsy the petticoat should not be quite so long as the child the gown a few inches longer with one cap only on the head which may be made double if it be thought not warm enough what i mean is that the whole coiffure should be so contrived that it might be put on at once and neither bind nor press the head at all the linen as usual this i think would be abundantly sufficient for the day laying aside all those swathes bandages stays and contrivances that are most ridiculously used to close and keep the head in its place and support the body as if nature exact nature had produced her chief work a human creature so carelessly unfinished as to want those idle aids to make it perfect shoes and stockings are very needless encumbrances besides that they keep the legs wet and nasty if they are not changed every hour and often cramp and hurt the feet a child would stand firmer and learn to walk much sooner without them i think they cannot be necessary till it runs out in the dirt there should be a thin flannel shirt for the night which ought to be every way quite loose children in this simple pleasant dress which may be readily put on and off without teazing them would find themselves perfectly easy and happy enjoying the free use of their limbs and faculties which they would very soon begin to employ when they are thus left at liberty i would have them put into it as soon as they are born and continued in it till they are three years old when it may be changed for any other more genteel and fashionable though i could wish it was not the custom to wear stays at all not because i see no beauty in the sugarloaf shape but that i am apprehensive it is often procured at the expense of the health and strength of the body there is an odd notion enough entertained about change and the keeping of children clean some imagine that clean linen and fresh clothes draw and rob them of their nourishing juices i cannot see that they do any thing more than imbibe a little of that moisture which their bodies exhale were it as is supposed it would be of service to them since they are always too abundantly supplied and therefore i think they cannot be changed too often and would have them clean every day as it would free them from stinks and sournesses which are not only offensive but very prejudicial to the tender state of infancy  the feeding of children properly is of much greater importance to them than their clothing we ought to take great care to be right in this material article and that nothing be given them but what is wholesome and good for them and in such quantity as the body calls for toward its support and growth not a grain more let us consider what nature directs in the case if we follow nature instead of leading or driving it we cannot err in the business of nursing as well as physic art is ever destructive if it does not exactly copy this original when a child is first born there seems to be no provision at all made for it for the mothers milk seldom comes till the third day so that according to nature a child would be left a day and a half or two days without any food to me a very sufficient proof that it wants none it is born full of blood full of excrements its appetites not awake nor its senses opened and requires this intermediate time of abstinence and rest to compose and recover the struggle of the birth and the change of circulation the blood running into new channels which always put it into a little fever however extraordinary this may appear i am sure it is better it were not fed at all for it sleeps almost the whole time and when the milk is ready for it would be hungry and suck with more eagerness which is often necessary for it seldom comes freely at first at least i would prevail thus far that the child be not awaked out of its sleep to be fed as is commonly done this is the constant course of nature which is very little attended to and never followed the general practice is as soon as a child is born to cram a dab of butter and sugar down its throat a little oil panada caudle or some such unwholesome mess so that they set out wrong and the child stands a fair chance of being made sick from the first hour it is the custom of some to give a little roast pig to an infant which it seems is to cure it of all the mothers longings i wish these matters were a little more enquired into for the honor of the sex to which many imperfections of this kind are imputed which i am sure it does not lie under when a child sucks its own mother which with a very few exceptions would be best for every child and every mother nature has provided it with such wholesome and suitable nourishment supposing her a temperate woman that makes some use of her limbs it can hardly do amiss the mother would likewise in most hysterical nervous cases establish her own health by it though she were weak and sickly before as well as that of her offspring for these reasons i could wish that every woman that is able whose fountains are not greatly disturbed or tainted would give suck to her child i am very sure that forcing back the milk which most young women must have in great abundance may be of fatal consequence sometimes it endangers life and often lays the foundation of many incurable diseases the reasons that are given for this practice are very frivolous and drawn from false premises that some women are too weak to bear such a drain which would rob them of their own nourishment this is a very mistaken notion for the first general cause of most peoples diseases is not want of nourishment as is here imagined but too great a fullness and redundancy of humors good at first but being more than the body can employ or consume the whole mass becomes corrupt and produces many diseases this is confirmed by the general practice of physicians who make holes in the skin perpetual blisters issues etc to let out the superfluity i would therefore leave it to be considered whether the throwing back such a load of humor as a womans first milk be most likely to mend her constitution or make her complaints irremediable the mothers first milk is purgative and cleanses the child of its long hoarded excrement no child therefore can be deprived of it without manifest injury by degrees it changes its property becomes less purgative and more nourishing and is the best and only food the child likes or ought to have for some time if i could prevail no child should ever be crammed with any unnatural mixture till the provision of nature was ready for it nor afterward fed with any ungenial alien diet whatever the first three months for it is not well able to digest and assimilate other aliments sooner there is usually milk enough with the first child sometimes more than it can take it is poured forth from an exuberant overflowing urn by a bountiful hand that never provides sparingly the call of nature should be waited for to feed it with any thing more substantial and the appetite ever precede the food not only with regard to the daily meals but those changes of diet which opening increasing life requires but this is never done in either case which is one of the greatest mistakes of all nurses thus far nature if she be not interrupted will do the whole business perfectly well and there seems to be nothing left for a nurse to do but to keep the child clean and sweet and to tumble and toss it about a good deal play with it and keep it in good humor  but now the child i mean when it is about three months old requires more solid sustenance we are to enquire what and how much is most proper to give it we may be well assured there is a great mistake either in the quantity or quality of childrens food or both as it is usually given them because they are made sick by it as to quantity there is a most ridiculous error in the common practice for it is generally supposed that whenever a child cries it wants victuals and it is accordly fed ten twelve or more times in a day and night this is so obvious a misapprehension that i am surprised it should ever prevail if a childs wants and motions be diligently and judiciously attended to it will be found that it never cries but from pain now the first sensations of hunger are not attended with pain accordingly a child i mean this of a very young one that is hungry will make a hundred other signs of its want before it will cry for food if it be healthy and quite easy in its dress it will hardly ever cry at all indeed these signs and motions i speak of are but rarely to be observed because it seldom happens that children are ever suffered to be hungry in a few very few whom i have had the pleasure to see reasonably nursed that were not fed above two or three times in four and twenty hours and yet were perfectly healthy active and happy i have seen these signals which were as intelligible as if they had spoke  there are many faults in the quality of their food it is not simple enough their paps panadas gruels etc are generally enriched with sugar spice and sometimes a drop of wine neither of which they ought ever to taste our bodies never want them they are what luxury only has introduced to the destruction of the health of mankind it is not enough that their food be simple it should be also light several people i find are mistaken in their notions of what is light and fancy that most kinds of pastry puddings custards etc are light that is light of digestion but there is nothing heavier in this sense than unfermented flour and eggs boiled hard which are the chief ingredients of those preparations what i mean by light to give the best idea i can of it is any substance that is easily separated and soluble in warm water good bread is the lightest thing i know the power of due fermentation in which consists the whole art of making it breaks and attenuates the tenacious particles of the flour so as to give it these qualities i mention and make it the fittest food for young children cows milk is also simple and light and very good for them but it is injudiciously prepared it should not be boiled for boiling alters the taste and property of it destroys its sweetness and makes it thicker heavier and less fit to mix and assimilate with the blood but the chief objection is that their food is wholly vegetable the bad consequence of which is that it will turn sour in their stomachs the first and general cause of all the diseases of infants is manifestly this acescent quality of all their food if any of these vegetable preparations i have named be kept in a degree of heat equal to that of a childs stomach it will become sour as vinegar in a few hours time these things are therefore very improper to feed a child wholly with some part of its diet should be contrived to have a contrary tendency such as we find only in flesh which is the direct opposite to acid and tends to putrefaction in a due mixture of these two extremes correcting each other consists that salubrity of aliment our nature seems to require as we are partly carniverous animals a child ought not to be fed wholly upon vegetables the mothers milk when it is perfectly good seems to be this true mixture of the animal and vegetable properties that agrees best with the constitution of a child readily passes into good blood requiring but a gentle exertion of the powers of circulation to break and subdue its particles and make them smooth and round and easily divisible i would advise therefore that one half of infants diet be thin light broths with a little bread or rice boiled in them which last is not so ascescent as any other kind of meal or flour these broths should be made with the flesh of full grown animals because their juices are more elaborate especially if they had never been confined to be fatted the juices of a young ox taken from the plough make the finest flavourd and most wholesome soup i believe it is for the same reason the flesh of all wild animals has a lighter taste than that of tame saginated ones and is therefore most agreeable to the palates of the luxurious but this is to be understood of those creatures that feed on corn or herbage the other part of childrens diet may be a little bread and water boiled almost dry and then mixed with fresh milk not boiled this without sugar spice or any other pretended amendment whatever would be perfectly light and wholesome of sufficient nourishment something like milk from the cow with the additional strength and spirit of bread in it twice a day and not oftener a sucking child should be fed at first once with the broth and once with the milk thus prepared as to the quantity at each time its appetite must be the measure of that its hunger should be satisfied but no more for children will always eat with some eagerness full as much as they ought therefore it must be very wrong to go beyond that and stuff them till they spue as the common method is they should not be laid on their backs to be fed but held in a sitting posture that swallowing may be easier to them and that they may the more readily discover when they have had enough when they come to be about six months old and their appetite and digestion grows strong they may be fed three times a day which i think they ought never to exceed their whole lives after by night i would not have them fed or suckled at all that they might at least be hungry in the morning it is this nightfeeding that makes them so overfat and bloated if they be not used to it at first and perhaps awaked on purpose they will never seek it and if they are not disturbed from the birth in a weeks time they will get into a habit of sleeping all or most part of the night very quietly awaking possibly once or twice for a few minutes when they are wet and ought to be changed if it be thought necessary to give them any thing between meals a little milk and water is best their meals and in my opinion their sucking too ought to be at stated times and the same every day that the stomach may have intervals to digest and the appetite return the child would soon be quite easy and satisfied in the habit much more so than when taught to expect food at all times and at every little fit of crying and uneasiness let this method be observed about a twelvemonth when and not before they may be weaned not all at once but by insensible degrees that they may neither feel nor fret at the want of the breast this might be very easily managed if they were suffered to suck only at certain times if this plan of nursing were literally pursued the children kept clean and sweet tumbled and tossed about a good deal and carried out every day in all weathers i am confident that in six or eight months time most children would become healthy and strong would be able to fit up on the ground without support to divert themselves an hour at a time to the great relief of their nurses would readily find the use of their legs and very soon shift for themselves  if it be asked whether i mean this of children in general and that weakly ones born of unhealthy parents should be treated in the same manner i answer that it is not so common for children to inherit the diseases of their parents as is generally imagined there is much vulgar error in this opinion for people that are very unhealthy seldom have children especially if the bad health be of the female side and it is generally late in life when chronick diseases take place in most men when the business of love is pretty well over certainly children can have no title to those infirmities which their parents have acquired by indolence and intemperance long after their birth it is not common for people to complain of ails they think hereditary till they are grown up that is till they have contributed to them by their own irregularities and excesses and then are glad to throw their own faults back upon their parents and lament a bad constitution when they have spoiled a very good one it is very seldom that young children are troubled with family distempers indeed when we find them affected with scrophulous venereal or high scorbutic complaints we may reasonably conclude the taint to have been trasmitted to them but these cases are very rare in comparison of the many others that are falsely and without the least foundation imputed to parents when the real cause is either in the complainants themselves or bad nursing that has fixed them early in wrong habits in one sense many diseases may be said to be hereditary perhaps all those of male formation by which i mean not only deformity and distortion but all those cases where the fibers and vessels of one part are weaker in proportion than the rest so that upon any strain of the body whether of debauch or too violent exercise the weak part fails first and disorders the whole thus complaints may be produced similar to those of the parent owing in some measure to the similitude of parts which possibly is inherited like the features of the face but yet these diseases might never have appeared but for the immediate acting cause the violence done to the body most distempers have two causes the one a particular state of the solids and fluids of the body which dispose it to receive certain infections and impulses the other the infection or impulse itself now what i contend for is that though this predisponent state or habit of the body be heritable yet the diseases incident to these wretched heirs may be avoided by preventing the active cause which may be done in many cases by a due attention to the nonnaturals as they are called in plainer words by a regular temperate life in children by good nursing therefore i conclude that instead of indulging and enfeebling yet more by the common methods children so unhappily born that which i am recommending together with the wholesome milk of a healthy nurse is the best the only means to remedy the evil and by which alone they may by degrees be made healthy and strong and thus in a generation or two of reasonable temperate persons every taint and infirmity whatever the kings evil and madness not excepted would be totally wore out  the plain natural plan i have laid down is never followed because most mothers of any condition either cannot or will not undertake the troublesome task of suckling their own children which is troublesome only for want of proper method were it rightly managed there would be much pleasure in it to every woman that can prevail upon herself to give up a little of the beauty of her breast to feed her offspring there would be no fear of offending the husbands ears with the noise of the squalling brat the child was it nursed in this way would be always quiet in good humor ever playing laughing or sleeping in my opinion a man of sense cannot have a prettier rattle for rattles he must have of one kind or other than such a young child i am quite at a loss to account for the general practice of sending infants out of doors to be suckled or drynursed by another woman who has not so much understanding nor can have so much affection for it as the parents and how it comes to pass that people of good sense and easy circumstances will not give themselves the pains to watch over the health and welfare of their children that possibly would take much more with a shrub or a flower especially as the love of posterity is so natural to mankind i would earnestly recommend it to every father to have his child nursed under his own eye to make use of his own reason and sense in superintending and directing the management of it nor suffer it to be made one of the mysteries of the bona dea from which the men are to be excluded i would advise every mother that can for her own sake as well as her childs to suckle it if she be a healthy woman it will confirm her health if weakly in most cases it will restore her it need be no confinement to her or abridgment of her time four times in four and twenty hours will be often enough to give it suck letting it have as much as it will take out of both breasts at each time it may be fed and dressed by some handy reasonable servant that will submit to be directed whom likewise it may sleep with no other womans milk can be so good for her child and drynursing i look upon to be the most unnatural and dangerous method of all and according to my observation not one in three survives it to breed a child in this artificial manner requires more knowledge of nature and the animal economy than the best nurse was ever mistress of as well as more care and attention than is generally bestowed on children the skill of a good physician would be necessary to manage it rightly i am very glad this is not the method of the hospital i believe there is not the least color of objection to any part of the management of that most useful and excellent charity as far as it depends upon the directors of it sending the children out to country nurses under the care of inspectors is undoubtedly the best method they could take but how far these nurses and their inspectors who i suppose are to be some good gentlewomen in the neighborhood may be persuaded out of their old forms to treat their nurselings a little more reasonably is matter of much doubt i fear they will be too tenacious of their prejudices as well as opinionated of their skill to be easily convinced they are in the wrong and who shall undertake the task however i despair not of seeing a reformation one day or other and to contribute to it as much as lies in my power i will give you my opinion as to the precautions necessary to be taken in the choice of these nurses and likewise a few reasons why the children entrusted to their care should be treated somewhat differently from those who are nursed in a more natural way and suck their own mothers i make no doubt but great care is taken that the nurses recommended to the hospital be clean and healthy women but this is not enough the preference should be given to the middleaged because they will have more milk than the very young and more and better than the old this is a material consideration as i suppose they have each her own child to suckle besides those between twenty and thirty are certainly of the best age but what i think of the utmost consequence is that great regard should be had to the time of their lyingin and those procured if possible who have not been brought tobed above two or three months the reason of this is that nature intending a child should suck about a twelvemonth the milk seldom continues good much longer about that time women in general though they give suck are apt to breed again some indeed that are very sanguine will breed sooner these notwithstanding their milk are apt to be troubled with the catamenia which disturb it greatly and therefore are not so proper to be made nurses of but whether they breed or not it is my opinion that after a years time or thereabouts however it may agree with a child that has sucked it from the first their milk will become stale and vapid at least very unfit for a newborn infant that if it be deprived of its own mothers milk ought undoubtedly to have what is most like it the newer it is the more suitable in all respects to its tender nature yet it is a common thing for a woman to suckle two or three children successively with the same milk  a nurse ought to have great regard to her diet it is not enough that she be sober and temperate her food should consist of a proper mixture of flesh and vegetables she should eat one hearty meal of fleshmeat every day with a good deal of garden stuff and bread thin broth or milk would be best for her breakfast and supper her drink should be small beer or milk and water but upon no account should she ever touch a drop of wine or strong drink much less any kind of spirituous liquors giving ale or brandy to a nurse is in effect giving it the child and it is easy to conclude what would be the consequence  the children likewise thus sent out require a particular treatment the plan i would lay down could i prevail should be that of nature excluding art and foreign aid entirely but when this is broke in upon a little adventitious skill becomes indispensibly necessary that if we are not perfectly right in following closely the design of nature we may cooperate a little and not be totally wrong in counteracting it as is too often the case what i mean is that every child not allowed the mothers first milk whether it be drynursed or suckled by another woman should be purged in a day or two after the birth and this purging continued for some time not by regular doses of physic that may operate all at once but some lenient laxative should be contrived and given two or three times a day so as to keep the childs body open for the first nine days or fortnight lessening the quantity insensibly till it be left off it should be so managed that the operation of the artificial physic may resemble that of the natural this is so material that for want of it most children within the first month break out in pimples all over the nurses call it the red gum and look upon it to be a natural thing and that the children will be unhealthy that have it not so indeed they will be in all likelihood and it is better that these foulnesses which become acrid and hot by remaining too long in the body should be discharged through the skin than not at all or that they should be lodged in the blood or fall upon the vitals to lay the foundation of numberless future evils but it is chiefly owing to the neglect of this method at first a child that sucks its own mother unless it be greatly overfed or kept too hot will never be troubled with this humor at all if the children that are brought to the hospital be not above a month old and it be found upon enquiry that they have not sucked their own mothers something of this kind prescribed them would not be too late nor improper the following form may be used take manna pulp of cassia of each half an ounce dissolve em in about three ounces of thin broth let the child take two spoonfuls three times a day varying the quantity according to the effect which at first ought to be three or four stools in four and twenty hours  orders should be given these nurses to keep the children awake by day as long as they are disposed to be so and to amuse and keep them in good humor all they can not to lull and rock them to sleep or to continue their sleep too long which is only done to save their own time and trouble to the great detriment of the childrens health spirits and understanding with regard to feeding them as it is not likely they should have milk enough to support two their own and the hospital child it is best they should begin immediately according to the method i have recommended if they or their inspectors can be persuaded to think it right which however i would not have understood so strictly but it might sometimes be a little varied preserving only the intention i would advise however if it be thought proper now and then to give them a little bread and butter that the butter be perfectly sweet and fresh and allowed but in very small quantity otherwise it will be apt to turn bitter and rancid in the stomach and foul all the juices of the body a child might be allowed any kind of mellow fruit either raw stewed or baked roots of all sorts and all the produce of the kitchen garden i am sure all these things are wholesome and good for them and every one else notwithstanding the idle notion of their being windy which they are only to very debauched stomachs and so is milk but no mans blood wants the cleansing refreshing power of milk more than his whose stomach used to inflammatory things of high relish will not bear the first chill of it to children all this kind of food taken in moderation is perfectly grateful and salutary some may think that they carry into the stomach the eggs of future worms but of this i am not very apprehensive for i believe there are few things we eat or drink that do not convey them but then they can never be hatched in a healthy inside where all the juices are sweet and good and every gland performs its office the gall in particular would destroy them bullocks gall has been found to be a good and safe vermifuge it is my opinion we swallow the eggs of many little animals that are never brought into life within us except where they find a fit nest or lodgment in the acid phlegm or vitiated humors of the stomach and bowels were these totally discharged every day and the food of yesterday employed or thrown off to the last grain no worms could ever harbor in our vitals as soon as the children have any teeth at six or eight months they may by degrees be used to a little fleshmeat which they are always very fond of much more so at first than of any confectionary or pastry wares with which they should never debauch their taste  breeding teeth has been thought to be and is fatal to many children but i am confident this is not from nature for it is no disease or we could not be well in health till one or two and twenty or later teeth are breeding the greatest part of that time and it is my opinion the last teeth give more pain than the first as the bones and gums they are to pierce are grown more firm and hard but whatever fever fits or other dangerous symptoms seem to attend this operation of nature healthy children have sometimes bred their teeth without any such bad attendants which ought to incline us to suspect the evil not to be natural but rather the effect of too great a fullness or the corrupt humors of the body put into agitation by the stimulating pain the tooth causes in breaking its way out this i believe never happens without some pain and possibly a little fever but if the blood and juices be perfectly sweet and good and there be not too great a redundancy of them both will be but slight and pass off imperceptibly without any bad consequence whatever the chief intention of the method i am recommending is to preserve the humors of the body in this state and therefore if it succeeds children so managed will breed their teeth with less pain and danger than are commonly observed to attend this work of nature  as i have said that the first and general cause of most of the diseases infants are liable to is the acid corruption of their food it may not be amiss just to mention an easy and certain remedy or rather preventive if given timely at the first appearance of predominating acid which is very obvious from the green stools gripes and purgings occasioned by it the common method when these symptoms appear is to give the pearl julep crabs eye and the testaceous powders which though they do absorb the acidities have this inconvenience in their effect that they are apt to lodge in the body and bring on a costiveness very detrimental to infants and therefore require a little manna or some gentle purge to be given frequently to carry them off instead of these i would recommend a certain fine insipid powder called magnesia alba which at the same time that it corrects and sweetens all sournesses rather more effectually than the testaceous powders is likewise a lenient purgative and keeps the body gently open this is the only alkaline purge i know of and which our dispensatories have long wanted i could wish it was more universally received among us and think it well deserves the rank in our books of pharmacy which it already has in some foreign ones i have taken it myself and given it to others for the heartburn and find it to be the best and most effectual remedy for that complaint it may be given to children from one to two drams a day a little at a time in all their food till the acidities be quite overcome and the concomitant symptoms disappear entirely i have often given it with good and great effect even when the children have been far gone in diseases first brought on by prevailing acid  there are some other little niceties that were they observed in the nursing of children would be of some use to them such as putting them soon upon their legs in order to forward their walking accustoming them to use both hands alike for employing one more than the other will not only make the hand and arm so used but also that side of the body bigger than the other this is sometimes the cause of crookedness it would likewise not be amiss to forward their speaking plain by speaking plain distinct words to them instead of the namby pamby style and giving them back their own broken inarticulate attempts by which means i believe some children scarcely speak intelligibly at seven years of age i think they cannot be made reasonable creatures too soon  these few loose thoughts on the subject of nursing children i send you for your private satisfaction if they be lucky enough to give you any i have neither time nor patience to think of form and order or supporting them by affected demonstrations taken from mechanical principles and powers all i have endeavored is to be intelligible and useful and therefore i have a voided as much as possible all terms of art together with learned quotations as often produced out of vanity and to show deep reading as for the sake of proof if you think it may be of any use to publish this letter i am not unwilling it should appear if not do with it what you please i deliver it up as a foundling to be disposed of as you think proper i shall only add by way of persuasive to those who may be inclined to make trial of the method i recommend that i am a father and have already practiced it with the most desirable success  finis
