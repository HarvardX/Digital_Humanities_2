hymns founded on various texts in the holy scriptures  by the late reverend philip doddridge d d  published from the authors manuscript by job orton  i esteem nepos for his faith and diligence his comments on scripture and many hymns with which the brethren are delighted eusebius eccl hist l   c    salop printed by j eddowes and j cotton and sold by j waugh and w fenner at the turks head in lombard street and j buckland at the buck in paternoster row london mdcclv  the preface the author of the following hymns well known to the world by many excellent and useful writings was much solicited by his friends to print them in his lifetime from a hope they might be serviceable to the interest of religion by assisting the devotion of christians in their social and secret worship and had god continued his life till his familyexpositor on the epistles had been published it is probable he would have complied with their request but this and many other pious and benevolent purposes were broken off by his muchlamented th during the last hour i spent with him a few weeks before that mournful event he honored me with some particular directions about transcribing and publishing them i have at length through the good hand of my god upon me finished them and present them to the world with a cheerful hope that they will promote and diffuse a spirit of devotion and together with other assistances human and divine prepare many to join with the devout author in the nobler and everlasting anthems of heaven  these hymns being composed to be sung after the author had been preaching on the texts prefixed to them it was his design that they should bring over again the leading thoughts in the sermon and naturally express and warmly enforce those devout sentiments which he hoped were then rising in the minds of his hearers and help to fix them on the memory and heart accordingly the attentive reader will observe that most of them illustrate such sentiments as a skillful preacker would principally insist upon when discoursing from the texts on which they are founded there is a great variety in the form of them some are devout paraphrases on the texts others expressive of lively acts of devotion faith and trust in god love to christ desire of divine influences and good resolutions of cultivating the temper and practicing the duties recommended others proclaim an humble joy and triumph in the gracious promises and encouragements of scripture particularly in the discovery and prospect of eternal life the nature of the subjects will easily account for the difference of composure why some are more plain and artless others more lively sublime and full of poetic fire if any of them should at first reading appear flat or obscure it may well be supposed they would affect the mind in a stronger manner when used in a religious assembly after sermons upon the texts in which the context has been considered if that were necessary parallel places compared the design of the inspired writer judiciously opened and the beauty propriety and emphasis of the several clauses of the text illustrated they therefore who use them in their devout retirements should first read and consider the texts and contexts and if they would consult some expositor upon them particularly the authors on the subjects taken from the new testament they will see a spirit and elegance in these composures which may otherwise be overlooked and be more likely to reap real and lasting advantage by them  in this collection there are many hymns formed upon passages in the old testament particularly in the prophets directly relating to the case of the israelites or some particular good man among them which the author has accommodated to the circumstances of christians where he thought there was a just and natural resemblance and he apprehended that the practice of the inspired writers of the new testament warranted such accommodations compare hebrews xiii     and family expositor in loc note  e there are also some good remarks on this subject in dr wattss holiness of times places etc disc v especially prop     he experienced this to be a very acceptable and useful method of preaching on the old testament and accordingly recommended it to his pupils as what would afford them an opportunity of explaining the design of the prophecies displaying the wisdom faithfulness and grace of god and suggesting many striking and important instructions this method would at the same time occasion an agreeable variety in their discourses prevent their confining themselves to general or commonplace subjects or in order to avoid a frequent repetition of wellknown arguments running into dry and abstruse speculations which the capacities of the generality of their hearers could not comprehend nor their hearts relish and feel a fashion in preaching too prevalent and considering its apparent unprofitableness much to be lamented  those young ministers who are desirous of entering into the spirit and copiousness of scripture may find this work greatly useful to them by directing them to many very suitable texts and to some natural thoughts and useful reflections to be insisted upon in discoursing from them  there are several hymns in this collection suited to special and extraordinary occasions for which there was not before a sufficient provision such as for opening a new place of worship the vacancy and settlement of churches the ordination of ministers their removal from our world etc especially for days of fasting and humiliation on account of actual or apprehended calamities the want of which during the late rebellion and war was much regretted by many ministers and private christians  in these composures i hope few low or trivial expressions will be found nothing appears unsuitable to the gravity and dignity of a worshipping assembly nothing likely to darken or damp the devotion of the humble christian or excite passions merely sensual there is nothing that savours of a party spirit or carries an appearance of designing to confine their use to any of the sects into which christians are unhappily divided the materials are divine and the authors soul was never more enlarged than when he was promoting a spirit of piety and candor in their just connection  i chose to place these hymns in the order in which the several texts lie in the bible as that prevents the necessity of another index and there appeared no particular reason for disposing them in any different order in a few places where words occur not sufficiently intelligible to common readers i have added some more plain and familiar ones in the margin that they may be read and sung with understanding preferring this method to that of some authors who have collected and explained them in a particular index  as these hymns were composed during a series of many years amidst an uncommon variety and daily succession of most important labors by a man who had no ear for music and as they want his retouching hand the reader will be candid to what inaccuracies he may discover particularly the repetition of the same thoughts and phrases which in a few instances will be found and indeed some of them could scarcely be avoided on subjects so nearly resembling without the exclusion of the most suitable and affecting sentiments or aspirations for which the introduction of a new or more poetic thought and phrase would not have been an equivalent there may perhaps be some improprieties owing to my not being able to read the authors manuscript in particular places and being obliged without a poetic genius to supply those deficiences whereby the beauty of the stanza may be greatly defaced though the sense is preserved  these hymns being originally designed for the use of a congregation of plain unlearned christians it cannot be expected they should entertain such who may peruse them merely for the sake of the poetry yet i think many of them will stand the test of a critical examination and appear at least equal to other compositions of the like kind and i am persuaded they will all be delightful and beneficial to those who desire to have their devotions enlivened their souls filled with divine love and who are ambitious to live up to the rules of the gospel and that they will through the influences of the holy ghost spread a spirit of fervent piety in such congregations where they may be introduced  i have nothing to add but my earnest wishes and prayers that they may be subservient to the glory of god the more delightful celebration of divine ordinances and the edification of my fellow christians amen  job orton salop jan        a table to find out any hymn by the first line of it a accept great god thy
