sentimental excursions to windsor and other places with notes critical illustrative and explanatory by several eminent persons male and female living and dead  as a motto is a word to the wise or rather a broad hint to the whole world of a persons taste and principles vive la bagatelle would be most expressive of your ladyships characteristic  macklins man of the world london printed for j walker paternoster row mdcclxxxi  to mr charles macklin dear sir you are to consider this dedication as a grateful return to the warmth of your friendship a just tribute to the integrity of your heart  seven years intimacy have convinced me of both   exclusive of these motives i have another   the author of sir callaghan obrallaghan merits respect from every irishman  that character has been of national service by being a means of removing in a great measure illiberal prejudices which had too long promoted enmity between sisterkingdoms but are now happily diminished  i am most sincerely yours the author  advertisement this bagatelle appeared originally in the public ledger in detached pieces most of which were copied from that paper into the morning herald  and they having received the approbation of the public the writer was induced to collect them into a volume and as he will pursue the subject in the ledger should this volume have success he will shortly publish another  sentimental excursions i read and read but could not retain a word of what i read  so many friends flowed in upon me daily to breakfast and so many friends to carry me out to dine that to understand the doctrine of descents the point i was studying was impossible i must cut off said i the entail of these engagements and become master of my own time  returning from the grecian at one in the morning i ordered my servants to pack up my clothes with a few books and at six he with my portmanteau on his shoulders and i with lord coke under one arm with whom i intended to comment upon old law and sir james burrow from whom i expected instruction in new law under the other i do not understand what our journalist here means by his distinction between old and new law the efficient principles of law are immutable the coincidents are the same therefore modern determinations should coincide with ancient adjudications otherwise notwithstanding the coexistence of legal principles which i have proved somewhere to be at least coequal with nature itself judgments upon the same principles would be deficient in cooperation lord cokes reports are called the gospel of the law  sir james burrows reports may be styled the apocalypse of the law and as for my reports i am determined to have them called the apocrypha of the law  c l  t  set off for the windsor stage  the coach was empty so ordering my man to mount the outside and going inside myself after musing a few minutes on the great progress i should make in the art and science of jurisprudence during the vacation between easter and trinity term i folded my arms within each other having first wrapped myself in a large cloak threw myself along the seat and wishing farewell to london to all the pleasures of london and to all its temptations fell into a profound slumber  the highwayman this was in the merry month of may when the whole animal creation from the minutest insect the microscope discovers upon the leaf to the largest beast which grazes in the field or preys in the forest when the fowls of the air from the diminutive humming bird to the eagle of the sun when the fishes of the sea from the little sprat to the unwieldy leviathan pay implicit obedience to that divine ordinance of heaven increase and multiply i say it was in the month of may so justly styled the mother of love when nature wears an universal smile when every plant and tree sprouts forth in bud and blossom and the whole earth is clothed in variegated green being fast asleep in a stagecoach on the road to windsor and my imagination having taken an excursion in a dream to visit to converse with and to embrace some dear friends in ireland i was disturbed from my sweet vision about five miles from london by a tremendous voice from the side of the road which with reiterated vociferation roared out stop stop  my hands instinctively slipped into my breeches pocket and with a motion equally involuntary drew forth a small purse containing the small sum of one guinea and a few shillings to give the highwayman the coachman at the same instant drew up his horses  if any hero wishes to be informed why i did not rather apply to my pistols  i had none with me or if i had i should not have applied to them  indeed instead of charging my pistols which i left hanging up in my chambers where may they long hang for ornaments i had prepared the small sum i have before mentioned and put it into the little purse aforesaid in case of being stopped for it has long been my opinion that if a man considers his own interest in which undoubtedly his peace of mind has an intimate and large share  to part with what he can spare from his absolute necessities will appear preferable to risquing rise for a trifle it requires no great portion of humanity to conclude that to deprive a fellow creature of life and dispatch his soul in the very act of sin to that country from whose bourne no traveller returns though compatible with earthly justice must be offensive to eternal mercy if this assertion be erroneous how comes it that the act of sacrificing a wretchs life in defense of a paltry sum always impresses upon the mind of the avenger a horror which amounts to punishment  as the coachdoor opened i put out my hand  here my honest friend said i addressing myself to the highwayman here take my money  i received a shot in return for my courtesy   i say a shot  but not a shot from a pistol nor a shot from a blunderbuss  it was a chainshot or a doubleheaded shot which you please discharged from a pair of as bright eyes as ever wounded the heart of an unwary traveller  the lady mistaking the offer of my hand which intended to convey my purse to the supposed highwayman for an offer to assist her into the carriage seized it with the most good humoured familiarity and fixing her right foot firm upon the coachstep raised her body up with a spring of agility which clearly proved elasticity was not the least property in her composition  thus she stood in equilibrium nodding and smiling a farewell over her left shoulder to a male friend the person who had ordered the coach to stop and taking her seat exactly opposite to me she waved her hand out of the coach window to her parting companion  the coachman with a hoi hoi and a crack of his whip informed his horses of their duty the horses obeyed and we drove on  the pocket hoop it is astonishing that women will encumber their persons so as to alter the elegant symmetry of the human frame  the person of a fine woman is the most beautiful edifice in nature  true beauty consists in simplicity and the figure of a wellmade female always shows to the best advantage when its ornaments are simple  it should never be embellished in the composite order  from the days of fig leaves to the present time art has only labored to disguise nature   history informs us that queen elizabeth was remarkable for the protuberance of the rotunda and this say the antiquarians in dress first introduced the fashion of hoops but whether this rotunda was a permanent rotunda behind natural to the make of her majesty or a temporary rotunda before arising from a natural cause authors are silent hoops are of much greater antiquity than our author seems to have a knowledge of  they were worn by the greeks and romans queen elizabeths hoop was called a farthingal it gave rise to scandal but to keep her majesty in countenance the whole court assumed big bellies which soon became the general pink of the mode this courtly condescension to the virgin queen has nothing particular in it  when queen anne had a lame leg the women of fashion carried crutchsticks and not many years past the late french king being forced to cut off the foretop of his hair on account of a scaldhead not only the nobility and gentry of france but the nobility and gentry of great britain and ireland cropped their upper locks close to the scull when henry viii in      cut his hair short all england followed his example camer oper subcisio cent      c c  tt  r  l  the divine writer isaiah describes the jewish ladies of his time in an attire so exactly similar to that which distinguishes the modern english ladies of the ton that one would imagine he was prophesying of their dress he mentions their stomachers and their towering heads their curls their flowing garments and their crispingpins solomon too who having the experience of five hundred wives and fifteen hundred concubines and of course must have been well acquainted with the influence of the female over the male sex in his admonitions to youth cautions them to beware of the rustling of silks and the creeking of heels for it leads to  it led solomon the wisest of mankind from the worship of the almighty god to the sacrifice of idols  madan d d     a hoop says an old writer is an airy cool dress  that may be answers a modern writer arguing upon the same subject  but how comes it to pass that queen elizabeth who was a virgin queen and her maids of honor who were virgins by virtue of their office should require more cooling than their grandmothers now the question is very easily answered  queen elizabeth and her maids of honor were virgins  their grandmothers certainly were not  i suppose sir said my fellowtraveller we shall breakfast here as the coach stopped at the star and garter at kewbridge  i leaped out and gave the lady my hand  she sprung forward but the treacherous hoop crossing the door of the coach gave so sudden a jerk to the lady that as she sprung she fell and as she fell of course the hoop became inversed as you may have seen an umbrella or parasol on a windy day  she slipped from under her garments  heaven preserve us  i fixed my eyes upon the sign  it is the star and garter said i to myself in an under voice and in the same tone i read the motto   honi soit qui mal y pense i kept my eyes fixed upon the sign without once attempting to extricate the lady had it been the sign of the gorgons head i could not have been more petrified  but my man who had now descended from the roof of the coach having more presence of mind entered the coach at the opposite door and taking the lady by the shoulders gently pulled her backwards while i smoothed her clothes and brought the villainous hoop to its primitive situation  the lady having adjusted her drapery came out sideways   i led her into the house and being shown into a room  she cursed her hoop in a tone of bitterness infinitely more vindictive than the curse itself  but how could i say amen  i considered myself under some obligations to the object of her curses so amen stuck in my throat  seraglios  spanish protections i tell you they are nothing to the english hoop confinement stimulates a woman to do that which otherwise would never enter her head  and pray sir did you ever hear that a padlock could protect a leathern portmanteau from the plundering hand of a robber i tell you no woman has her chastity so well fortified as an english woman of the present day who the devil can approach her in the rear she carries bastions of cork  in front she has crownworks of whalebone  on the right and left flanks and gorgeats nothing is wanting to complete the strength of the place but a tenaille in the ditch  but if the fashion continues sir we shall never be able to carry a point by storm  true and therein lies the safety of female chastity for all approaches must now be carried on by sap whenever a lady commits faux pas in the daytime  do you mind in the daytime  she must never more blame her stars or attempt to excuse the transgression by the suddenness of the attack as so many preparatory maneuvers are necessary to the dismantling of the place  now the daughter of the old general who was making these wise remarks upon the utility of hoops was preparing for bed in an adjacent room and by clapping a hand to each hip and drawing a slipknot overturned every thing her father said  for down came the fortification with the bastions and the crownworks flap upon the floor i wish said the young lady slipping under the bedcloaths my fathers wish would succeed  i wish it was the fashion for every woman to have a tenaille in the ditch  toby     it was all my own fault said the lady  i should have come out sideways at first  but the way you attempted to come madam said i was the most natural  true she replied but not the most fortunate our natural movements seldom are said i  till this instant i considered hoops as protections from such accidents replied the lady but i now perceive they render ones motions very unnatural  so saying she retired breakfast was served in  the lady returned divested of her hoop  her dimity jacket fitted her shape exactly  her petticoat hung in folds  an elegant neglegee appearance marked her person  the conscious tint upon her cheek indexed the continuance of her confusion  we breakfasted and having ascended the carriage with caution and taken our seats without further accident pursued our journey  though the air in the month of may is more congenial to the blood and more invigorating to the constitution of all animals than the air of any other month in the year yet man or woman after long residence in the metropolis the pores being open and the muscles being relaxed by the heat of full theaters balls routs masquerades ridottos close rooms and seacoal fires will find the morning breeze of the country too sharp for their unbraced nerves and debilitated joints  this was my case  i perceived my fair companion also shrunk from the acuteness of the biting air and sought comfortable warmth in closely wrapping round her a pale pink satin cloak lined with sable fur  i dont know a more pleasing contrast than pink faced with black  and the lining of the ladys cloak formed such a contrast the black fur with which it was lined turning over the edge of the pink satin like a facing or lapel scarlet faced with black has been the uniform of the bravest troops it was worn by ligoniers horse who fought with such amazing courage at dettingen and fontenoy and is now worn by  the london military association  anonymous   perceiving then that the lady not only indicated an aguish tremor but that sleep had shed his drowsy influence upon her lids which repeatedly dropped their fringed curtains over her eyes  i proposed drawing up the coachblinds  the lady complied   we both benefited by the precaution   the lady soon involuntarily resigned herself to the soft folding arms of sleep who fixed his leaden seal upon her eyes  i exercised my mind in meditation  it has been said that sleep is the emblem of death the object i looked upon so far from raising this gloomy idea in me produced a quite contrary effect  i thought of nothing but life and prolongation of life  my thoughts arose from my feelings my feelings from what i saw  but my feelings were not merely local  life trembled through the current of my blood  dilated my heart  inspired my soul  expanded my thoughts  warmed my imagination to ecstasy  and i answer for it spoke at my eyes  how easy would it have been at that instant to have tickled me to death  i should have shrunk from the touch like a sensitive plant   the lady slept on   a meditation the scene at the inndoor when i innocently gazed up on the star and garter was fresh in my memory not an astronomer of them all from ptolemy the egyptian down to copernicus the german and from copernicus the german down to newton the englishman had ever so strong a conception of the hirsute constellation called by stargazers berenices locks as i had of the sign at kewbridge  every object was painted upon my imagination in the most lively colors  i recollected the ladys confusion on the unfortunate event of her pockethoop  and this recollection produced in my mind an investigation of modesty  when an indian was asked how he could go naked and expose his body to the cold air he answered because i am all face now the same answer would have been as pertinent had it related to modesty instead of feeling for in those countries where the inhabitants go perfectly naked they look upon each other as undisturbed with as chaste an eye and unflushed countenance as if they were all face with them every part is equally indifferent as to sight the less modesty the less feeling  the less feeling the less incontinence in thought in word and in deed  the lacedaemonians were remarkable for virtue yet possessed very little modesty and when we compare their customs with the customs of the cheerful happy inhabitants of the southern isles discovered by captain cook it appears the lacedaemonians were perfect masters and mistresses too of the celebrated timiradi dance practiced by the people of both sexes in otaheite plato after the example of several well instituted republics ordained that the men and women of all ages should divest themselves of their clothing and appear perfectly naked you will see the reason of it in his gymnastick the women of pegu wear no covering below the waist but a cloth slit up before  the lacedaemonian women saw daily the spartan youth perform their exercises naked and wore such slight garments themselves that as they walked discovered their thighs they being as plato says sufficiently covered with their virtue  montaigne  this might perhaps cool the sense of seeing  but how did it affect feeling  seeings believing but feeling has no fellow  rays proverb    it must be left to the judgment of the ladies whether the daughter of cato was right in her opinion that women should take off and reassume their modesty with their garments it is certain the roman matron was a patriot not however of that class of patriots who ornament the present times she was not influenced by self  but from a regard to posterity  and where is the woman who has not a regard to posterity i answer  the woman who is not solely attached to one man has neither regard for posterity nor for herself and cannot be a patriot  thus did i mentally philosophize till after long meditation i concluded with a modern voyager forster who attended captain cook on his second voyage  who from the contemplation of unpolished people has drawn this opinion that modesty and chastity which have long been supposed to be inherent in the human mind are local ideas unknown in the state of nature and modified according to the various degrees of civilization  yet when adam and eve had eaten of the forbidden fruit plucked from the tree of knowledge they saw they were naked and were ashamed  oh chastity thou art a great and shining virtue in civilized states thy utility is sufficiently known  but to govern and prevail with thee according to nature is as difficult as it is easy to do it according to custom thou have nothing let me tell thee pure and fair maid to support thy precepts but the hoary head and shrivelled face of ancient use  and what is to be deduced from this why that the fair fabric of chastity was erected upon the ruins of the bowers of paradise but is not chastity in women the same as courage is in men is not chastity the very center of a womans point of honor is not female chastity a castle defended by religion morality reason custom pride apprehension and shame true but when nature mutinies within and love attacks the outworks this welldefended castle is no more than  a castle in the air  the examination the lady slept on   i could not get a wink of sleep   the devil take that sign said i to myself cursing the star and garter at kewbridge yet why should i curse the star and garter is it not an insignia which our most gracious sovereign respects  which the first of our nobility are continually in pursuit of  and has not the learned pettingall who was a master of arts thus delivered his opinion after quoting some hundred authorities in all languages that the star and garter are amulets or charms allegorical symbols of unity or as camden and heylin have it a bond of the most inward society and a badge of unity and concord to inspire courage and vigor in men  and does he not say what every true man will join with him in saying honi soit qui mal y pense should be rendered shame and confusion to him that designs any evil against the wearer that is the wearer of the star and garter may all his designs be retorted on the author but why are the bench of bishops excluded from wearing this amulet because they have mitres annexed to their bishoprics and that amounts to the same thing  and as to the lawyers why they have their black patches upon their wigs  and their scarlet patches upon their doctors gowns  and their furs for their judges robes delectable to the touch  to banish the idea of the sign at kewbridge i examined the ladys face  her eyes were shut  here could i ramble through half a dozen pages expatiating on the beauty of the eye  whether black hazel gray or blue  whether open or closed whether shaded by a full grown dark brow or arched over with the smoothness of a mouseskin  i never gave a determined preference to any particular color only let it not be a jaundiced eye  nor a basilisks eye  i hate both  but i have long thought that the eye of a woman looks best when on the twinkle that is when it is neither open nor shut but like the setting sun skirted by a shading cloud emanates a lambient fire through the medium of bordering fringe with which nature has wisely provided it for the purposes of ornament and protection   give me an eye with quivering beams dancing with irregularity like the reflection of the moon upon agitated water mr de loutherbourg is under the necessity of acquainting the public as a duty he owes them as well as himself that he has not given his assent to the insertion of the above idea which is undoubtedly stolen from the moonlight scene in his eidophusikon and is therefore an imposition on the public and an invasion of his property  lislestreet leicestersquare april           i was eighteen years of age when i first discovered that the perfection of beauty in the eye or rather the perfect force of the operations of the eye upon the heart is not to be found either when the eye is open or when the eye is shut but when the eye is upon the twinkle  the impression i then received was deep and i shall die in the opinion which was the result of it  the manner in which i received this impression may appear hereafter  a description the lady slept on  smiled as she slept and as she smiled she sighed   health sported upon her cheek while love with a most enticing grace diffused a nonresisting if not inviting complacency over every feature and wantoned on her neck  her lips smooth and red as coral pouted with fullness and with a glowing ripeness equal to the blush of the wild strawberry smooth as the sattind softness of the nectarines coat divided to give emission to her breath discovering a set of teeth vying with orient pearl   her breath   i sat opposite to her  her breath fanned me with a fragrance infinitely more inspiring not less odoriferous than the evening zephyr of june agitating a rosethicket stealing its sweets if mrs dawson looks in her glass she will see an original resembling this picture    the effect however was different the fanning zephyr would have cooled but the southern blast that gathers consuming heat from the burning desert of arabia could not scorch with more violence than the breath of my fellowtraveller   all appeared quiet within the peaceful habitation of her bosom which gently heaving preserved uninterrupted calmness except when a halfsuppressed sigh or short breathing broke in upon the regular serenity of its motion  she sighed  but her sighs were not the sighs of sorrow  neither were they the sighs of pain  they were the sighs of sensibility  and i discovered the nature of her sighs by the gentle agitations of pleasure which ever preceded their risings as tender harbingers or followed them as affectionate attendants   it is probable the lady was in a dream if she was it was a dream of such sensibility she might be said to wake sleeping critics may object to this expression but it is certainly allowable at this time when the greatest men sleep waking   i do believe it to be true that dreams are certain interpreters of our inclinations  i dream but seldom and my dreams are generally produced by pleasant thoughts  montaigne  it is no wonder if those things which men think on have an affection for and practice when waking should agitate their minds when they are asleep  cicero  an expostulation with sleep why do thou detain me so long from my friends  shall i never get free from the cells of delusive imaginations  shall i be for another hour dead to sentiment to the world and to myself when am i to walk out of thy yawning palace and be alive to action and joy once more  i will be revenged on thee for i will abhor the name of every thing that sooths and fawns upon me to become thy captive  detested be the poppy and laudanum detested be the sparkling liquor that enervates the powers and thrice detested be the downy bed  never more may i become thy prey  the days of my life are but short and let them be spent in the improvements of action and in the service of my country and my friends  vain hope for i feel that i can no longer resist thy soporisic vengeance  thus exclaims then sinks in silence  l  d n     i drew a divination from her dream   the wagon rut the road was smooth  the coach rolled on  the lady slept  but as she slept she slipped   the cushion on which she sat gently gave way  perceiving her in danger of falling and anxious to prevent it i placed my feet close to here is  this precaution immediately transferred the point of gravity from the feet to the knee and the coach continuing to communicate its motion to the lady no sooner were her feet stopped than her knees naturally bent forward   determined to support her i gently slipped forward till our knees met   for above a mile we rolled along the road foot to foot knee to knee  the coach continuing to communicate motion to the lady the lady communicating motion to me  till unfortunately the road growing rough the motion increased and became irregular  i lost my situation  the lady lost her situation of consequence  still the lady slept  and smiled  and sighed  and slipped unconscious of her danger but the coachwheel slipping into a waggonrut i slipped forward the lady slipped downward and my lord coke who had lain unnoticed upon the seat ever since i came into the coach in the morning slipped down at the same instant with the lady but luckily reaching the bottom of the carriage first his lordship broke her fall  i did all in my power to support her but in vain  though the lady did every thing she could to support herself and my lord coke lent his assistance   the accident appeared beyond remedy  so being on my knees i offered up a hasty yet warm sincere ejaculation to the great god of love who lending an ear auspicious to my prayer in about two minutes i was extricated from  no  not extricated from my confusion but extricated from my awkward position and found myself able to replace the lady in her seat   having settled the lady i took up my lord coke and placed his lordship close by her  a reflection having got out of the rut and having passed the rough road which caused the foregoing accident the coach rolled on smoothly again   now there are many travelers who would rail for an hour without intermission against these rough spots which every man must sometimes meet upon his journey let him travel what road he will  some men meet them on high roads some men meet them on bye roads  some men meet them on mountains  some men meet them in valleys  they interrupt the rich man in his chariot and the poor man on the humble footpath way  philosophers have met these rough spots upon the summit of the alps the virtuosi have met them in the streets of rome  nay it has been said that very wise and grave philosophers have met them on the very carpets of their libraries for my part i meet them here and there and every where and wherever i meet them whether on high road or on bye road on mountain on valley or on plain i make the most of them wherever i travel or in whatever manner i travel whether i travel in a carriage on horseback or on foot i never abuse them   thank heaven there is a complacency in my disposition which bids defiance to trifling casualties and whether the road be rough or whether the road be smooth my temper is still the same and i never quarrel with the road nor with myself nor with any thing i meet but go whistling on  i only wish i may never meet these rough spots on mount aetna on mount vesuvius or on any other burning mount  i care not how warm the climate is  but heaven preserve me from volcanos  i have an implacable aversion to fire   a road may be considered as an emblem of life and much instruction may be picked up in very few miles traveling yet some there are and men of great name who have traveled to egypt and have attained nothing but the height of the pyramids or a sketch of the sphynx though they have written whole volumes upon what they have seen and have not seen  while others have been able to discover a thousand objects in a space not longer than from london to highgate upon which they have exercised all the benignity of philanthrophy   a road i say may be considered as an emblem of life  how various the prospect on the right and on the left  sometimes a serene sometimes a cloudy sky  how different are the passengers in their size in their complexion and in the manner of pursuing their journey  what innumerable stops from turnpikes  what a number of cross roads  how many arrests from accidents  and how few make for the same resting place or pursue one certain constant gait  this now is philosophizing  that is if to philosophize be as has been defined by some philosophers according to montaigne to write at random and play the fool as the essayist did and which i shall never blush at doing let my subject be what it may providing only that when i do write at random or play the fool my writing and my folly may be marked with some of his features  the confusion the sun had now risen considerably above the horizon  the kine had returned to their pastures having paid their milky tribute to the dairy  and the honest hind whose labor enables the luxuriant and the lazy to indulge in pleasures in sensuality and sloth while he experienced the effects of the first judgment announced by the divine wisdom against our primitive parents by earning his bread with the sweat of his brow softened its rigor with a cheerful song expressive of content  every object looked sprightly  every object appeared gay  every object wore the juvenile dress of summer  every object animate and inanimate contributed a share of cheerfulness to the scene  the situation in which the lady had discovered herself on waking had overwhelmed her with confusion a blush of the deepest dye far beyond the boasted tyrian diffused its color through her veins sometimes descending it spread over her fair bosom and then as if exhaled by the fire of her bright eyes rose to her face and revelled in a rubid glow  the deep color did not continue long  it faded by degrees to a rosy tint but not to a fixed complexion  it sported during the course of our journey in delicate shades it was not difficult to discover what the lady felt  it was evident from the revulsion of her blood that the soul labored and the body languished  if my confusion was not equal to the ladys nor lasting as the confusion which distressed her i felt an equal share of irritation it was my ardent wish to relieve her if possible though i stood in need of relief myself i would have roused my spirits but they had been so lately dispersed it was impossible to recruit them suddenly  i did all i could to rally them but in vain i looked to the lady for assistance  the lady looked from me as demanding assistance for herself  our nerves thrilled in unison  the vibration was sympathetic  the tremor was reciprocal  so had been the cause  i looked again toward the lady taking her at the same instant by the hand  the vital spirits began to revive from the lethargy they had lately sunk into  the ladys hand lay in mine a gentle mutual compressure gave my spirits the first alarm  as i looked toward the lady she turned her head round toward me just so much as to give the profile of her face a gentle sigh with a soliciting cast of the eye informed me she expected relief at my hands my heart felt the full force and propriety of the expectation  it almost amounted to reproach but how should i relieve her my ideas were astray my tongue was tied and could as well have answered calmly from the rack to the interrogatories of a persecuting spanish inquisitor as commence a conversation with my fair companion  neither of us could articulate a word  yet though silent we conversed  for the lady by degrees looking full in my face our eyes spoke and we perfectly understood each other  it was the language of nature whose declarations were sincere her thoughts are undisguised and scorn the deformities of duplicity  you should speak to me said the lady from charity   something for the sake of charity said a young seaman who had lost an arm and a leg privateering something for charity said the seaman as the coachman pulled up to the door of a small public house to take a dram it is very common for stagecoachmen and postboys to stop for the purpose of drinking drams both in england and ireland  twisss travels  and receive some parcels  a moment before i would most willingly have purchased this interruption at any expense being now relieved from embarrassment by the ladys having opened the conversation i wished the seaman had lost his head instead of his arm  just as my peevish temper suggested the inhuman thought the poor fellow addressing himself to the lady and turning from me said madam i have lost my arm in the service of my country  and he held up his stump  this man who had faced the horrors of war undaunted this man who had faced death in a thousand different shapes undismayed was scared by the inhospitable the ungracious and forbidding look vexation had thrown into my countenance  i was preparing to recompense the injury i intended him by my wish which was now retorted with full force upon myself by giving him the silver i had put into the purse i had prepared for the highwayman  but as i drew the purse from my pocket avarice whispered in my ear he has greenwich to support him or if not he has his parish to maintain him burrows settlement cases lay upon the seat opposite to me close to lord coke  the law has made a provision for him said sir james burrow  charity whispered in the opposite ear to that which avarice had applied her mouth to  this was the further ear from the poor sailor  but her words sunk deep into my soul  it is certainly an honor to the law whispered charity that it makes a provision for the poor but it is no great honor to human nature that the law has need to make such provision  the intention of the law is good said sir james burrow  but the hundreds of decisions upon charity cases which i have collected have swallowed up more of the provision allotted the poor than even the overseers have swallowed up  the poor are starved between the expenditures of litigation and gormandizing it was the opinion of the court of kings bench upon an application to increase the overseers of the poor in a certain parish that the distresses of the poor bore a proportion to the number of overseers appointed to take care of them  j burrow  like the arigentines they eat and drink as if every day was to be their last  montaigne     i had the purse half up when vanity stepping in with her advice and aiding the solicitations of charity induced me to draw it to the very edge of my pocket  a few acts of generosity said vanity prudently managed will give you as much reputation for goodness as most men desire  shall i said i to myself  shall i restrain the stream of charity that overflows my heart shall i retain for the purpose of some selfish gratification this trash taking the few shillings out of the purse this trash which divine bounty designed for the common benefit of all mankind  the opportunities and inducements we have to alleviate the miseries and promote the happiness of our fellow creatures are innumerable our hearts incline us to good our reason approves the acts of humanity   all we have is given to us  all we do is but ministering  a fat prebendary wellmounted and attended by two servants in livery came ambling up all in fine order  no determining which was best fed the fat prebendary the fat prebendarys servants or the fat prebendarys horses  sleek and fat  fat and sleek  nothing of a curate or a curates man or a curates horse about them  lean and pale  pale and lean  god bless your reverence said the maimed seaman holding out his hat with his left hand at the same time showing the stump of his right arm to the fat prebendary  the fat prebendary returned the blessing with the voice of meekness  god bless you said the fat prebendary  joining his hands together with his eyes elevated religiously toward heaven god bless you said his reverence turning down his eyes and looking on the seamans stump the prebendary gently spurred his horse and rode on   your honors will remember me said the seaman addressing himself to the prebendarys servants  the prebendarys servants looked as if they said amen to their masters prayers  the horses neighed  but they were brutes  what was the fat prebendary  what were the fat prebendarys servants  christians christians  a sergeant of the guards with his knapsack flung at his shoulders holding a child by the one hand and his wife following carrying another child succeeded  brother soldier can you spare a trifle to a poor seaman said the mutilated tar  d  n your eyes answered the sergeant here is all i can spare and he threw sixpence into the seamans hat  the wife followed the example of her husband  she dropped her mite and passed on o may that mite be laid up in heaven and may the scanty pittance in the corner of your husbands knapsack increase like the widows cruse   the serjeants curse cut me to the heart  i reproached myself blessed him and cursing the fat prebendary the fat prebendarys fat servants and the fat prebendarys fat horses though sure i wronged the beasts slipped the shillings i had held clinched in my hand into the hand of the seaman  i slipped them into his hand unknown to any one  almost unknown to myself  in truth vanity had nothing to say to the gift it was the gift of an impulse involuntarily springing from the noble motive of compassion which the example set me by the sergeant had instantaneously kindled in my breast   the lady also felt the force of the serjeants damn and contributed under its impulse to the seamans wants  i insert this damn of the sergeant as a precept for the edification of a certain bench and all those who derive authority under them  but they want not precept  it is in practice they are deficient  do as i say is the great foundation of their preaching  why can they not preach do as i do  come forth your grace with your duchess  come forth each marquis with his marchioness  come forth each earl with his countess  come forth each baron with his baroness  step forth ye knights with your ladies  and hear how the sergeant d  nd the semans eyes  he had experienced himself what suffering is and could not overlook it in another  o come forth look to his good works and cover the multitude of your sins for be assured your enormous subscriptions to a dancing skipping tribe of buffoons will avail you naught hereafter this idea of damn and blessing is stolen from one of farquhars comedies  j c  rt  y  n b it is not in joe miller  no man will say that the church is too amply provided for  bishop of peterb  gh in debate     the proposal the human mind should ever be employed mental exercise and industry being as essential to the health of the soul as corporeal exercise and labor is to the health of the body idleness in the mind produces vice idleness in the body produces disease the vacant hours of dullness are the most dangerous hours of life for when ever the tempter of mankind who is always on the watch finds the mind out of employment he never fails to step in with one or other vicious incitement to seduce the soul from virtue  for this reason i have established as a rule in the mental code by which i govern myself that when ever i find my mind inadequate to the exercises of study or rational contemplation which is too often the case to seek immediate employment for my ideas in some innocent amusement  it is certainly the most probable way of avoiding the devil and all his works  i never stood in greater necessity for the application of my rule than at the present instant  was my life to pay the forfeit i could not enter into a serious conversation with the lady or a proper conversation with myself so finding it impossible to speak and dreading the consequence of thinking i resolved to disappoint old nick by proposing an amusement  i asked the lady to play traveling piquet  traveling picquet the lady declared she was totally ignorant of the game   i once played the game said i when fortune being in a goodnatured mood as she was this day introduced me to a tete a tete party with a young widow whom i met at holyhead and traveled with in a post coach to chester   then said the lady you are but a novice at the game yourself  no madam answered i the young widow was experienced in it and by her instructions and playing it repeatedly since i am now a perfect adept at the game  and if you give permission will instruct you   the lady bowing smiled assent to play and i commenced my lesson  the lesson suppose madam said i addressing myself to the lady suppose madam you and i  or suppose madam you and any other companion were traveling in a coach postchaise or vis a vis  a vis a vis exclaimed the lady to ride in a vis a vis is the height of my ambition   a vis a vis madam said i is the most convenient carriage for playing traveling picquet in twenty to one  i proceeded in my instructions  suppose madam you and i travel together in a carriage  we are traveling together observed the lady  well madam you and i traveling together in a carriage i reckon two for every gate i see on the right hand side of the road you reckon two for every gate you see on the left hand side of the road and so according to agreement a certain number is reckoned for every object seen by you on your side of the road or seen by me on my side of the road whether man or woman horse or mare bull or cow ram or ewe cock or hen etc   you understand me madam said i   perfectly answered the lady   but observe madam  a man and woman  a horse and mare  a bull and cow  a ram and ewe  a cock and hen  et caetera said the lady interrupting my recapitulation  i went on  a man and woman and caetera madam may chance to present themselves on your side of the road or on my side of the road so as to entitle you madam or to entitle me madam to a repique  you must explain that said the lady   remember madam said i  i dont say man or woman horse or mare etc  but man and woman horse and mare etc  your reason sir for the distinction said the lady   doctor lowth madam now bishop of london and all learned grammarians inform us that or is a conjunction disjunctive   i have been taught so myself said the lady   the same learned bishop madam and other learned authorities  you dont except to the bishop for being a living authority it has been a rule of court not to receive living authorities in the kings bench neither sir wm blackstones inimitable commentaries nor my reports have been attended to  c l  f  t  this is rather extraordinary when we consider what little reverence has been paid to precedents which are now termed the dead letter of the law and to old acts of parliament which have lately been termed obsolete statutes  c  m  n     no sir   well madam they have all laid it down that and is a conjunctivecopulative   the lady hummed a tune  you now understand the game madam the lady hummed on   if you dont understand it madam the fault is not with you nor with me nor with the bishop of london nor with the other learned grammarians and i swear by moses rod which rod was greater than all the rods of all the egyptian magi or by the scepter with which the great mogul attempts to rule the beauties in his seraglio the fault should not be imputed to nature  she has given us understanding sufficient to understand all things that should be understood  and pray where does the fault lie sir said the lady   we will find out the place presently madam  the game the lady had reckoned on several gates   so had i   the lady had reckoned on several passengers male and female   so had i   the lady had reckoned on horses kine sheep goats dogs cats and poultry of various kinds  so had i   the lady had reckoned on wagons carts coaches chaises whiskeys and caprioles   so had i   the lady had reckoned on one gigg   so had i   the lady had reckoned up to fifty i had only reckoned up to thirty the eagerness of expecting conquest sparkled in her eye and marked every feature of her face when a young woman who desired to be taken up as an outside passenger stopped the coach   the repique the prospect on my side being beautiful naturally drew the ladys eyes that way to view it we were admiring the landscape when a country lad and lass who appeared fatigued with the labor of the morning for the lass walked leaning upon the lads arm having arrived at the shady side of a hillock sat down   i reckoned four to my game   the lad gave the lass a kiss  by the rule of the game i was entitled to reckon two more   he kissed her again  again  and again  i foresaw the game would be my own  encore said i   devil take the impudent fellow said the lady peevishly at the same time suppressing a half smile i shall certainly lose  but the lass madam said i appears as much my friend as the lad   she is a methodist perhaps answered the lady and has been instructed in the doctrine of non resistance   and he is probably of the same profession replied i for if i am not mistaken there will be a love feast presently  the lad gave the lass another kiss to illustrate my supposition  i reckoned two more  the lady bit her under lip   that madam said i is a point  the lady hummed and looked down   and  that madam continued i pointing with my forefinger thus  is a quint  the lady looked up  looked forward then looked up again as if to look for something in the sky and overlook every thing on the ground  she then looked down and played with her apron string   the lass on the hillock side was also looking at the sky   you will certainly lose madam  i believe i shall lose said the lady tying and untying her apron string   there is no doubt now madam  see see  point  quinte and quatorze  a repique by the feathered arrow of cupid and by his favorite quiver  the lady took a serious look at the lad and lass to be convinced of her loss and being convinced turning her head aside tacitly acknowledged i had won   the young country woman who stopped the coach had by this time agreed with the coachman  had ascended the box and adjusted herself in her seat   you may now drive on said the young country woman to the coachman   so  we drove on   and may every man i esteem on earth drive through the journey of this life with as much pleasure content and innocence of heart as i drove on to windsor   i had no reason however to triumph in my victory  for though i won the first i lost the second and third game before i reached the town  a digression as i was sitting in my chambers at the conclusion of the last division of my excursions a loud knocking brought my servant to the outer door outer door  by the author keeping his outer door shut it appears that he was under some apprehension from gentlemen yclepd bailiffs as they have no right to force a mans outward door though they may if they once get in force every inward door and make their caption and the door of a lodger gives him no protection  this was determined by the court of kings bench upon principles of wisdom law convenience and humanity  james burrow  the same point was determined contrary to this decision in the kings bench of ireland and upon the very same principles of wisdom law convenience and humanity   anally cj  the english and irish bar in full cry  o the glorious uncertainties of the law     knock  knock  knock   who is there said i   the devil sir answered my servant   bid the devil enter  said i   enter devil bows devil my master sir desires me to inform you that he has shown your excursions to some critics who all agree that it will never sell without an introduction   author my respects to our master good mr devil and assure him he shall have an introduction preliminary discourse prologue or preface by tomorrow morning at ten oclock  exit devil  so now mr devil for  a devilish good  introduction    introduction as the reviewers from the quantity of literary drudgery they are forced to go through every month cannot possibly have time to read the whole of every book they give an opinion on it is probable our author introduced his introduction in this place in hopes the reviewers would not read so far  next month will show whether the reviewers have reached his introduction indeed the probability is that they will not peep farther than into the title page   anonymous  in which introduction if there should appear any malice envy detraction revenge indecency etc the courteous reader will recollect that this same introduction was written at the instigation of the devil at a time when i had not the fear of heaven before my eyes  it will be said i have imitated stern i have heard of an author who wrote a play in imitation of shakespeare the play was a good play enough and had one line strongly imitative of shakespeares manner which line was good morrow good master lieutenant  it will be said i imitate stern  it is true like stern my pen guides me i dont guide my pen i write my thoughts liberally unstudied and unarranged as they spontaneously arise to my imagination without cultivation or pruning  of consequence they will be deficient in ornament in profit and in strength  but if they are natural i am satisfied  i have always read stern with delight and never read him but i felt him in my heart more than in my head yet i hope his precepts have improved my understanding in the same proportion they have expanded my humanity his precepts affect me like wine they make my heart glad  they affect me like love or rather they affect me like a conjunction of love and wine for they make me generous and gay imbibing his opinions has sweetened whatever portion of acidity nature misfortune and disappointment have mixed in my composition and having grafted them upon my heart it is probable their emanations may produce some pleasing blossoms some good fruit  good fruit may be produced by ingrafting upon a crab  this is a palpable plagiary from my duenna  the author of the duenna whoever he is      if i should exhibit any feature bearing likeness to stern i shall be proud of the similarity but for this happiness i can scarcely hope the style of stern is peculiar to himself his art is to please the imagination and improve the mind with natural yet elegant simplicity he is master of that charming enthusiasm inspired by heaven itself for the instruction of its creatures and in his composition there is a certain incommunicable art of making one part rise gracefully out of another which is felt by all though seen only by the critic see a students letter to john dunning esquire in defense of the rev h bate printed by bladon paternoster row  his life his opinions his sermons his journey his letters and every thing he has written will be read with admiration will be read with pleasure and with profit when the labored works of laboring philosophers travelers historians politicians and other mouse ingendering compilers the mountain was in labor and brought forth a mouse  aesop  shall lie sleeping in dust upon the upper shelves of shops and libraries the booksellers would be very wrong to let them sleep upon their shelves when they can have a price for them and put them in circulation among pastrycooks snuffretailers fireworkers chandlers cheesemongers and their customers  anonymous  the works of stern will be in the hands in the heads and in the hearts of every man ay and every woman too of feeling when the works of the smellfungusses and the mundungusses of the age will be lining trunks and band boxes i have cut up several of the best modern authors at my shop the corner of st pauls churchyard as any person may see who will take the trouble of looking into my trunks  deputy clements   the imatators of stern it must be allowed have as much wit as they have judgment and there are plenty of them heaven knows this is clearly irony  i profess myself an imitator of stern and the following critique which i did not send to the morning herald nor pay for will show whether i have been successful in my imitation or not  peter mdermott  the critique if stern was ever rivalled in the descriptive the narrative in language or in the sentimental it is by mr mdermott in his new publication of the female monitor the history of arabella is one of the most masterly drawings of the human pen  lock hume and many other celebrated authors have favored us with essays on education but in arabella they live and theory rendered practicable by sweet and easy admonition the strictures of the female monitor with the authors own digressions are admirably interwoven in the piece and forms a most instructive and agreeable dialogue the letters from mr worthy to his son charles at oxford are sterling and abounds with honorable precepts and information the description of the old halfpay officer given by charles is one of those most affecting a sentimental situation that demands the tear of admiration and plucks the laurel from the monk of calis  lady gays career through life is dramatically conceived and gives precept a risible cast judiciously introduced to close the scene  the name of the author of the female monitor as well as the modesty which marks this critique clearly points out the country which had the honor of giving him birth a circumstance which in my opinion must recommend him to all mammas all mams of boarding schools and private governesses of young ladies particularly as the critique declares the work to be the most masterly drawing of the human pen which shows that the work like many other works does not carry the traits of the goosequill indeed it goes a great way to prove the certainty of an old opinion that irishmen have wings and out of some of their pinions perhaps mr mdermotts human pen was plucked but i find it impossible to conceive though i have called in my husbands aid to my assistance the following assertion   lock hume and many other celebrated authors have favored us with essays on education but in arabella they live now as lock and hume are indubitably dead and we have not heard of their resurrection how comes it that they live in arabella indeed were they alive it is out of nature to suppose they should live so long in arabella for though jonas lived a considerable time in the whales belly his life was preserved by miracle and he was but one person whereas it appears that arabella is ensient that is big with lock hume and several other authors it is true a certain duchess of heidleberg had three hundred and sixtyfive children at a birth and the font in which they were christened is still shown in the great church of the town but then these were children not men but perhaps the critique upon mr mdermotts work does not mean that the philosophers and authors are in poor arabella in a state of transubstantiation but only in spirit which the author of the female monitor might believe if he admits the doctrine of metempsychosis or transmigration of souls for though a woman could not rightly entertain so many men in ventra semere corporally yet she might entertain them spiritually as may be proved from the number of devils sometimes a whole legion together which have possessed persons in former times  catharine mac gra  m  the female monitor certainly demands the tear of admiration whenever admiration weeps but i cannot think there was much sentiment in the authors plucking the laurel from the monk of calais by which i suppose he must mean  the few scattered white hairs upon his temples   courtney melmouth  whether i have wit or judgment must be left to my readers and among these i hope i shall be honored with the judgment of the reviewers  reviewers it was my opinion when i wrote in favor of the irish nation that there should be at least one banker hanged once within every year it is now my opinion that there should be at least one reviewer hanged within every month these fellows i speak of the reviewers look only for the excrementitious parts of a work and indeed it must be allowed that no town hag has a better nose at smelling out ordure they remind me of a bird of passage of the aquatic tribe which annually visits a little island on the irish coast near the harbor of dublin this bird is called by the vulgar a magsh  and lives by pursuing gulls and pecking them with his bill which though blunt is offensive and provoking till the poor gull droppeth his dung which the magsh  swalloweth up for food   jonathan swift  i have mentioned your title gentlemen and cannot pass you by unnoticed  though like yahoes i expect you will mount among the branches of my laurel if the reviewers are not entitled to the laurel yet surely as they are the extracters of the essence of every work they are deserving of the laurel water  k  nr  k jun  and bemute my fair production what say the critical sons of sapience several persons having been surprised that strong marks of lunacy should appear in the criticisms of the reviewers doctor hunter a very able anatomist took their brains into physical consideration for brains most of them have notwithstanding what some people have advanced to the contrary and having first discovered that their productions were lunar he next found that from the nature of their office being forced to write in the full of the moon it fully accounts for their periodical insanity  anonymous  they lift up their voices and cry as one man these sentimental excursions are a servile imitation in thought in word and in deed suppose they are imitations they are imitations of a great master who had his jerkin as he says himself cut and slashed by these reviewers to very shreds and well might he say cut and slashed for be it known to all whom it may concern in the republic of letters that these kings of shreds and patches the reviewers do literally cut and slash  they having almost given up the use of pen and ink in composing their works and substituted scissars and paste  the people of the literary world that is the people of paternosterrow can vouch the truth of this assertion not only as it relates to the reviewers but to the various tribes of modern mathematicians politicians biographists historians essayists voyagers ay and divines too who all cut and paste  paste and cut it is the author who can cut and paste well and not the author who can conceive and write well who makes money for the former will cut down and paste up half a dozen volumes before the latter can invent and arrange a single page  yet these form the modern literati modern literati i will give you their character we find among them enemies to princes yet flatterers of minions and sycophants moralists in theory yet sensualists in practice skeptics in doctrine dogmatists in judgment who while they profess disinterestedness and independence introduce their venal muses to voluntary prostitution  sam johnson   now imitation is quite a different thing from scissars and paste your scissars and paste gentry are the common defamers of the town every man of genius disclaims them i consider them as literary vagrants and were i on earth i would whenever i caught them scribbling take upon me the office of beadle and scourge them into an honest way of earning their bread  chapter churchill   every man who possesses a nice and critical eye must see that notwithstanding the present flourishing state of the elegant arts little more than imitation can be attributed to the artists of the day in any department from homer down to the lowest of the lowest poets all are imitators but the modern majority are pilferers query if this assertion is not a libel upon the house of commons by innuendo  many of them open literary robbers vide lord carlisles poems mr edens letters etc etc  wretched scribblers who by inserting among their laborious nothings whole paragraphs from books of genius stock the shops with heterogenous monsters now literary pilferers and robbers are not to be classed with imitators for imitators may possess what these dull rogues never can possess  they may possess genius and invention  the works of stern have at least a stronger claim to originality than any other modern production and yet even stern has his imitations he can laugh out in the tone of rabellais and skip from his subject or smile with the cheerfulness of montaigne or he can assume the sober sensations of delight of heartfelt complacency and seer with the pointed grave cervantes  now if i imitate stern have i not as just a right to imitate him as he had to imitate rabellais montaigne and cervantes or as virgil had to imitate homer we apples swim  aesops fables  the right i have but where is the ability stern could throw every thing into a new light but who can threw a new light upon stern  as to the thoughts which may appear in my works say what you will gentlemen reviewers my thoughts are my own wherever i collect them whether they are ferae natura caught by me flying in the atmosphere of fancy  or sporting in the fields of imagination  or whether they are rendered tame and profitable by the industry of anothers study whether they vegetate in my own brain or are transplanted there ready cultivated from the brain of another person my thoughts are my own wherever i get them for i cannot part with them when once i get possession of them  they become annexed to the soil  i have a common law right to them here our author shows a total ignorance of common law for no right in ideas exists by common law it has been proved to be but an ideal right  but though a man has no legal right in his own ideas yet he has a right to possess himself of every other mans ideas as may be fully seen by looking into my miltonic poem of the universe which was in a great measure dictated by my eudosia who sucked in her erudition from the great ferguson now alas defunct  but to the law  a majority of the twelve judges assembled in the exchequerchamber determined upon solemn debate that no man can have a transferable property by common law in his own thoughts after publication that ideas though brought into print not being tangible cannot be considered as property  for trover will not lie for them  a replevin cannot seize them an ejectment cannot describe them to the sheriff to take possession and the house of lords upon writ of error brought reversed the judgment in banco regis and affirmed the judgment of the exchequerchamber  ca l  ft may   th       what a noble decision was this for all the unfurnished heads in great britain i was concerned in it all grubstreet got credit by it and have ever since been furnishing their attic stories with other mens goods  arthur m  r  y lincolns inn     every author will be stealing and every author will cry stop thief  shakespeare was a thief  i do not mean in deer stealing but shakespeare stole from nature  pope was a thief  pope stole propriety of thought delicacy of sentiment justness of method  and elegance of composition  but this is an honest age we have no such thieves in these days if we had they could not live the reviewers are such excellent thieftakers  the school for scandal like peachums lock is a collection of goods stolen  an informer declared to charles the second that dryden had stolen the play of the spanish friar  gods fish exclaimed the facetious monarch has he i wish you could steal such another  the man of the world is a drama without an original thought every sentiment it contains is to be met with in the conversation of the times the manners exhibited are as familiar as the manners of common life and the incidents are merely such as happen every day nay the characters are nothing better than copies from nature  as to the general plan of the piece its unities its fable and its moral are so strongly similar to the foundation upon which the drama of the ancients has been built that the plagiary is evident these were the reasons which induced me so long to refuse licensing the piece besides it satirises reigning vices and a man should be very cautious how he exclaims against reigning vices or fashionable habits in a polite circle lest somebody present should apply the satire to himself  h  r  d   this comedy wants novelty it being acted every hour in every great house in every great square and every great street in this great metropolis and therefore as human nature is invariable the merit of the author of the man of the world consists in nothing more than exhibiting in dramatic form and dialogue the customs and habits which have unavoidably taken place and characterize the history of the day  having touched a little upon imitation and literary thieving i will now state a few unarranged thoughts on similarity of thinking   the variety we see in the persons in the faces and in the modes of thinking which distinguish the individuals who compose the human animal are astonishing but variety and contrast in the appearance and manners of man are necessary to the purposes of his being and show the infinite wisdom and infinite power of his creator  from variety and contrast of person we judge of proportion and the elegance of symmetry  from variety and contrast of face we judge of beauty and of ornament  and from variety and contrast of thinking we judge of intellectual capacity as it operates in the progress of its study upon sciences and its invention and improvement in the arts  so that it may be said that the knowledge of all arts and the knowledge of all sciences which include the knowledge of all things is the consequence of variety in our modes of thinking and contrast in our opinions which variety and contrast stimulate us to controversy and experiment and as virtue would not have been known but for the contrast of vice nor colors but for the variety of their shades neither would arts nor sciences have been known had the organs of mankind been so formed that every individual should think alike  yet notwithstanding the versatile sportings of nature in forming her creatures we often find a strong similitude of person a strong similitude of face and a strong similitude in the mode of acting and of thinking between persons totally unallied  totally unacquainted with each other and perhaps there never were such strong instances of similarity in thinking as have arisen within these few years  i shall pursue one line of illustration to support this assertion and that line shall be the line of the drama  mr sheridan has been so happy as to think like congreve to think like buckingham to think like farquhar to think like wycherly and rumor says that mr sheridan has been so happy as to think like many living authors a most unhappy accident happened at the moving a certain managers goods from his old house in great queen street to his new house in grovesnorplace a large trunk containing some hundreds of manuscript pieces was stolen out of the cart which was transporting them and the wretched authors have not been able as yet to hear any thing about them but it is the general opinion that in the course of the next season if they attend the theater on the performance of new pieces they may have the satisfaction of receiving auricular intelligence that their thoughts are not totally lost to the world a certain amanuensis is supposed to be the robber  public ledger  yet it is certain that on the merit of new pieces unhappily living authors do not think like mr sheridan some critics say that mr sheridan in his late prologue to lady cravens piece i did not intend my piece for public exhibition but for the entertainment of a few private friends  cp  n thought like mr colman in his late prelude  mr colman in this same prelude has thought like mr foot and in many of his other writings it is said mr colman has been so lucky as to think not only like those authors who have reached parnassus but like other authors who have attempted to gain the mount through the medium of mr colmans theater  mr sheridan and mr colman being both managers and authors may not only think like other authors but may think for other authors and crush their merit with impunity  mr cumberland in his west indian has thought exactly like mr macklin in his love a la mode in the widow of delphi mr cumberland has thought like himself shakespeare is certainly wrong in writing delphos the classical term is delphi but perhaps shakespeare meant delos a grecian island  r cumberland from the above note it is clear that had shakespeare possessed cumberlands learning or had cumberland possessed shakespeares genius they would have been upon an equality that is cumberland would have been as great as shakespeare and so vice versa shakespeare would have been as great as cumberland and england would have had the honor of producing the two greatest of all authors  anonymous   mr macklin has never been charged with thinking like any other author it has been my misfortune to be too communicative of my thoughts by which i have often been anticipated by those i considered as confidential friends  c macklin   mr dibdin it is true has thought but how he has thought is not worth thinking about and the same may be said of several others  mr murphy never troubles his head with thinking  he translates  mrs cowley has attacked miss moore for thinking like her and a templer asserts that mrs cowley in her belles stratagem has thought exactly as he  thought in a comedy and an opera both rejected by mr harris  captain jephson in his tragedies though he has thought like many people yet he has also thought much upon the similarity of things his law of lombardy is a tragedy of the massacre of similies he has told us in it what every thing is like but he has not told us what any one thing is  mr andrews in his dissipation has very fortunately thought like a gentlemen who some time since wrote an entertainment on lord darbeys fete champetre  the author of the lord of the manor has thought exactly as general burgoyne thought in the house of commons  but of all the authors or authoresses who have lately thought like their contemporaries no author or authoress stands so distinguished as miss lee and of all the accidents in the chapter of accidents the happiest accidents are these where miss lee thinks like another author wherever that happens miss lee certainly thinks well   but surely it is now full time i should think of continuing my excursions in the pursuit of which heaven send that i may think like stern  windsor the inn having arrived at windsor and handed the lady out of the coach into the inn we were showed into a parlour by the landlord in his proper person here a very serious difficulty started which never occurred at least to me during the whole course of the journey  how am i to part with my fellowtraveller thought i  ay there is the rub and a severe rub it was  i was totally ignorant of the ladys name  the lady was totally ignorant of my name  it is true i knew something about her but a motive in which curiosity had the smallest share made me wish most ardently to know every thing about her  no sooner had i perceived this inclination for gaining an intimate knowledge of the lady and the ladys affairs than i flattered myself that the lady felt as ardent an inclination to be intimately acquainted with me with every thing about me and with my affairs  i not only wished to know her but to know all her connections  i asked myself a thousand questions about her without putting one question to her   who is she  whence came she  who is her father  who is her mother  who are her brothers  who are her sisters  has she any brothers and sisters uncles aunts or cousins  these questions i put deliberately to myself stringing them together in succession as the facetious sancho panza the laughandbefatsubhero of don quixotes adventures strung his proverbs  but no sooner had i finished my interrogatories upon her relations than a multitude of other interrogatories rushed in upon my mind impetuously   is she a maid find that out would have been the proper answer   is she a wife  is she a widow  is she neither maid wife nor widow   is she a mistress  is she rich  that is no business of mine   is she poor not in spirit for to me she has been most liberal and if she wants assistance to replenish her purse or to right her wrongs by heaven my purse i was master of fortyeight guineas which was within two guineas of my quarters allowance and my sword which though of old mourningmounting had an excellent blade of genuine toledo temper are both at her service   love we stood in a parlour of the inn our hands locked within each other  it would be hard madam said i sighing after the pleasant journey we have experienced to part as ignorant of each other as we met  it shall not be my fault said the lady if we are not longer acquainted i am come to spend a few weeks at windsor and if you wish to continue an intimacy which accident produced and added i interrupting her which love assisted  love alas said the lady shaking her head there was no love in the case our meeting and every thing that has happened since we met were the effects of accident  assisted by nature then madam said i bowing and laying my hand upon my heart  and what is love but nature  thelady blushed but silently assented to my opinion which she illustrated by a sentimental gentle squeeze of the hand  i thanked her for the compliment by returning the squeeze in the same sentimental gentle manner i had received it and raising her hand to my lips she nothing loath kissed it with the genuine fervor of affection and sincerity  the lady recovered her spirits and the whole force of those spirits starting into her eyes her bosom heaving with a hearteasing sigh alas said she with an amiable frankness i must acknowledge the propriety of your observation  love is the child of nature but i must sincerely regret that mere accident has convinced me of this truth  how happy should i have been if a long acquaintance matured into friendship and a series of reciprocal obligations had been the means of my conviction  how happy should i have been if it had been my fortune to have loved from the result of judgment not from the effect of contingency and she wept   now the ladys tears were natural but it was unnatural to suppose that love could result from judgment  i acknowledge continued the lady wiping her eyes i acknowledge we are sometimes excuseable for yielding to the simple authority of nature but what have i done i have suffered myself to be hurried away to be transported by her tyrannical dictates whereas reason alone should have authority over the conduct of our inclinations  she wept again  i felt the full force of her tears  they were a dew which nourished my infant passion   falling upon one knee with faultering speech i swore never to part from her  her countenance brightened on hearing my vow  she appeared happy  her looks touched my very soul our happiness was mutual  and surely the pleasure which the benevolent mind feels in the happiness of others is one of the most delightful sensations with which the human soul is blessed  a question answered question  what is love   answer  love is a desire of contracting friendship of uniting with and communicating happiness to a beautiful object every eye making its own beauty  love is active eager sharp precipitate  love is fickle moving and inconstant love is a fever subject to intermissions and paroxysms  but give me that love which when the paroxysms have subsided retains an universal fire those who intend to try my celestial beds may be assured that the consequence will be that after experiencing the paroxysms of pleasure they will also experience an universal fire electrifying their whole frame as an emblem of which i have placed mercury over my temple  graham d m  but temperate and equal a constant established heat all easy and smooth without poignancy or roughness  yet love is a tyrant  all passions are tyrants but love is the greatest tyrant of all the passions for love holds all the other passions under arbitrary subjection  love leads every man by the nose the word nose as it stands here should not have been italicked but should have been written in the old roman or old irish characters i have been in rome and in dublin and understand the italian and irish men manners and tongues and i am clear that no man whose nose is of the italian cut ever permitted love to lead him by the nose  henrietta h  tt  n  love makes the miser soften the rigor of his avarice it never could soften the rigor of mine  rob  m  nn  s  nor of mine  tho h  r  d  lessens the appetite of the glutton we all deny this  the board of aldermen except john wilkes  slakes the thirst of the drunkard we never experienced this  town  d and ri  by  sooths the anger of the revengeful i never will forgive america  m  n  d  inspires the coward with courage that i deny  g  eg  r  n and  subdues the pride of the haughty it never did nor never will subdue me  gl  u  r   a warning take care ladies whether maids or widows we will put wives out of the question because wives are under coverture  take care ladies how you fall in love for the highest crested dame of you all the tyrant will bring  down up and down up and down derry derry derry derry up and down   here is a rest down derry down oh   here is a quiver   prick this burden down ladies and play it upon your piana fortes it is a soft tune and sounds best upon an instrument with buffed keys   this burden to an old song is the only requiem for your dying lover   nay ladies be you ever so young ever so handsome or ever so ugly ever so grave or gay goodhumoured or illhumoured the tyrant love will rule you  so beware ladies of the tyrants rule   but above all beware of the tyrants rule ye antiquated virgins with large fortunes who combating with the spirit against the flesh have outlived every desire  except the desire of possessing a young husband  a wish o may i never experience that love where the flame rises to a frantic passion to enjoy an object who flies me save me from coquets good heaven curse me not with jilts and bless me with the possession of that true love which looks to me alone for happiness  that true love which being founded on sincerity is a stranger to arts and gallantry  that true love which flourishes only amongst its own natural sweets complacency mutual esteem and constancy constancy well  and i have been constant though set down as a woman of gallantry i defy my enemies to say except the jew who not being a christian is not to be believed that i have ever shown inconstancy to one lover till i have met another lover whom i liked better  m to  bn  n  upon my honor this is truth and i could prove it by virtue of royal authority  t r  b  n    give me a woman whose mind is without stain whose manners are without art and whose person is free from every embellishment but those embellishments it has acquired from the hand of nature such a woman have i met  h  mil  n   the departure i must leave you said the lady drawing away her hand from mine but drawing it away reluctantly  my hand pressing her hand tenderly  i must leave you said she or my friends who are now impatiently expecting me will be surprised at my delay and knowing this to be the usual hour for the stages arrival will come to seek me  so permitting me to take the liberty of a kiss and promising i should hear from her in the course of the evening she departed from the inn  i led her to the outward door  she insisted i should go no farther  and not knowing but she had private reasons for refusing an escorte i permitted her to depart unattended my eyes following her down the street till coming to a corner she nodded a farewell and disappeared   a reflection i directly returned to the inn  and going into the parlour looked out of the window toward the royal palace  this is windsor said i to myself windsor so renowned in ancient story  windsor so celebrated in ancient song  and here our edwards and our henrys have resided have sported in the chase and exercised at the tournament   this is windsor rendered immortal by immortal pope and now the residence of the most numerous progeny that ever royalty produced  priam it is true had sixty sons but how many wives had priam   the prospect i was informed from the castleterrace was truly beautiful but the town is cursed straggling and cursed inconvenient  i took out my watch to see the hour  mercy preserve me exclaimed i it is but a few hours since i left london and what a number of incidents have marked that short space of time  every circumstance rushed upon my memory  i found myself uneasy  something was wanting  i sighed and my sighing told me it was my fair companion  but she was gone   the oversight was there ever such an oversight  was there ever such a fool as i have been to let her depart without enquiring her name  perhaps i may never see  perhaps i may never hear of her more  prudence on reflection may induce her to conceal herself   i rung for my servant asked him the ladys name but to enquire the ladys name had never entered into his head no more than it had entered into mine  i eased my chagrin by severely reproving his negligence though my uneasiness was the result of my own stupidity   my servant had spirit and i had always indulged him in a free exercise of it  he retaliated my reproof by telling me he had no orders to enquire after the name of the lady but said he with an arch significant smile i know the name of the country girl who rode with me upon the outside of the coach  i felt the sarcasm i saw the fellow triumph and could have knocked him down  raging with vexation and disappointment i had the coachman called  the coachman knew nothing about her  i had the waiters called  the waiters knew nothing about her  i almost stormed and snatching up my hat was proceeding to sally out upon an expedition of reconoitering and enquiry when my servant gave a half smack with his mouth and informed me i had not ordered any thing for dinner   i left him to indulge his own palate in the orders but meeting the landlord in the entry he presented a long bill of fare  you may have sir said the landlord and he run through his bill of fare throwing his eyes up for my command as he repeated each article  you may have venison fowls ducks roast leg of lamb pigeonpie mackarel etc etc  do you take me said i for an overseer of the poor or the bencher of an inn of court let me have a beefsteak  and i passed by the landlord   getting into the street i was as much at a loss as ever to find out the lady so enquiring my way to the castle i soon found myself upon the terrace   the terrace looking round me as i stood upon the terrace i was astonished at the beauty of the prospect the air was serene the landscape enchanting the sky clear except a few clouds toward the horizon which set off the brilliancy of its azure as moles do the fairness of the human skin  some villas lay open to the view others were in part concealed and the sun darted his midday beams to gild the various turrets and spires which glistened through the scene  the thames rolled his silvered flood in silent majesty toward the sea enriching his bordering banks with verdure and the brightest tints and woods and forests some planted by nature time immemorial others raised by the assisting hand of industry waved their graceful pliant branches and shook their leafy honors  obedient to every gale between these woods meadows pastures and gardens at different distances opening interminable gave a luxuriant diversity to the whole  here gurgling brooks gently meandering along their pebbly channels pour their tributary urns into the sovereign river  and there a rich profusion of hillocks tufted with various trees among which groups of animals grazed slept or played in peace and happiness though different in their kinds  the whole closed with an extended horizon and charmed the soul with delightful grandeur   alas said i looking round my soul elevated to enthusiasm  it was here our greatest english bards invoked and received the inspiration of their muse   so taking out my pencil i wrote in my pocketbook  the first lines of poetry i ever attempted   reflections on windsor forest here genius learned to pour the enlightened ray here dullness shut her leaden eye from day the youthful poet whod to same aspire here caught from thee my shakespeare living fire twas here the tragic muse aloft did sing here arne and handel tuned the dulcet string here laughing comedy with sprightly tread the gaudy feather tore from follys head exposed base vice and cried vile passions down reformed our manners and improved the town here poignant swift with barbed arrow stung here pope immortal golden numbers sung here streamed the tears of melancholy young here waller pipd the lovers melting lay here gently blazed the lambient slame of gay here addison improved the classic page here milton burned with fiere poetic rage here farquhar laughed and witty congreve warmed dryden divine the softened soul alarmed here goldsmith smiled and magic spenser charmed here otway row and thompson chose their rhyme names which defiance bid to mouldring time i wrote the above enchanting our author seems to have no bad opinion of himself  anonymous description with a pen made of a goosequill   heigh ho  i asked myself why that involuntary sigh i answered with another heigh ho alas what is all this without dear woman heavens last best gift   i will describe the excellencies of woman  but where shall i get a pen adequate to such a description   the goosequill is not worthy  the swanquill is too stiff  and the crowquill though used by ladies is too black and too often employed in the poisoning works of defamation  i will therefore leave the goosequill to philosophers  the swanquill to mathematicians and the crowquill to lawyers old maids and newspaperparagraphgatherers  but for myself i will pluck a quill from the bird of paradise  well i have plucked my quill and my pen is in order in gratitude then i cannot but say something of the pretty bird from whose tail i have plucked my quill  the bird of paradise it was long thought by naturalists that the bird of paradise had been hatched nested and fledged in ireland and that it was a bird of passage but in a paragraph which appeared some time ago in one of the public prints just before this little bird was seen hopping in covent garden ireland is denied that honor though it is allowed in the said paragraph that the old cock and hen who produced this lovely bird as well as the young cock with whom she first billed and flew away were irish  ash  n l  v  r knight  the subject is extensive the subject is so deep i know not where to begin  and if i do begin i fear i shall never reach the bottom   shall i begin at the head or shall i begin at the tail i write on the bird of paradise therefore the tail must have the preference to the head for of all the birds in the air the bird of paradise has the most beautiful tail  the tail of the bird of paradise is the most lovely to the eye  the tail of the bird of paradise is the most exquisite to the touch  the tail of the bird of paradise is the longest feathered and the flushest feathered tail of all the tails of all the birds which sport in the gardens of pleasure my pet raven has ten times a greater quantity of feathers upon its tail  char  e a  br  s   not the horsetail worn by the great cham of tartary  not the cowstail that dangles from the head of the indian bramin  not the tail worn by the bashaw of turkey  not the pigtails which hang pendulent from the wigs of the city traindbands  not the tripletails which evince the wisdom of the learned apprentices of the law and grave sergeants of jurisprudence  not the tails of the learned judges of meum and tuum  not the enormous tail of the lord chancellor  not the ramillietail of our old generals  nay nor the mighty tail of the famous ram of derby can be compared to or stand in competition with the tail of the bird of paradise i am very well acquainted with derby and have often seen the rams of those parts but cannot say that i ever saw any of their tails larger than the tails of other rams  f  rr  n   the tail of the bird of paradise is not to be matched in the british museum  the tail of the bird of paradise outdoes all the tails of all the birds in sir ashton levers olyphusum  there is not such a tail in the collection of doctor hunter and the doctor has tails from all countries and of all sizes  nay not a doctor nor antiquarian in europe possesses such a tail as the tail of the bird of paradise  we may say of the tail of the bird of paradise as yorick said of the whitebear vide tristram shandy vol iv page      the tail of the bird of paradise very well have i ever seen one might i ever have seen one am i ever to see one ought i ever to have seen one or can i ever see one  would i had seen the tail of the bird of paradise  for how can i imagine it  if i should see the tail of the bird of paradise what should i say  if i should never see the tail of the bird of paradise what then  if i never have can must or shall see the tail of the bird of paradise have i ever seen the feather of one did i ever see one painted  described have i never dreamed of one did my father mother uncle aunt brothers or sisters ever see the tail of the bird of paradise what would they give how would they behave how would the bird of paradise have behaved is the tail of the bird of paradise rough or smooth   is the tail of the bird of paradise worth seeing  is there no sin in it  is it better than any other tail  such a tail as the tail of the bird of paradise does not appear once in a hundred years it glows refulgent as the tail of a burning comet yet the tail of the bird of paradise is not a fiery tail but then the tail of the bird of paradise is not eccentrical in its motions as the tail of a comet is  it moves to and fro up and down like the tail of the fantailed pigeon  the tail of the bird of paradise has down upon like the tail of a teal  the tail of the bird of paradise in every thing  but motion  is unlike the tail of a water wagtail  here now could i disclose a tale upon tails but i might incur the displeasure of the ladies for of all tails the ladies hate telltales  but if i do not give my tale itself i will give the dimensions and properties of my tale my tale exceeds in length the canterbury tales of chaucer  my tale exceeds in profundity and acuteness the irish tales of ussin  my tale is as merry a tale as any of the crazy tales  my tale is as natural as adams tale my eudosia tells me that this is a very excellent little poem published by bell but having an indecent tendency will not permit me to peruse it though i understand it treats in part upon the docking of tails  c  p  l l  f  t  and my tale is as unfathomable as swifts tale of a tub   but had i the fire of homer  the judgment of virgil  the salt of horace  the persuasion of ovid  the imagination of dryden  the sublimity of milton  the every thing of shakespeare joined to the experience of rochester and the abilities of doctor madan i should be unequal to the task of telling the tale of the tail of the bird of paradise  i have read this dissertation upon the tail of the bird of paradise and think i may say to the writer as nell gwynn did to lord rochester who when he exclaimed  by all the gods of hellespont and greece  i had my hand upon the golden fleece nell answered  by all the gods of greece and hellespont you lie my lord your hand was never on it   gertrude m  h  n   what is all this said i to myself sighing what is all this without woman  woman woman heavens last best gift  that inestimable pearl in the bitter cup of life  not all the spring  the summer  the autumn of nature can communicate real pleasure without woman  and when we decline into the frigid arms of winter it is woman only can make frigid life desirable  o that i may descend into the vale of death hand in hand with a silverhaired companion after traveling many a day with her through the mazy paths of life  a companion who has soothed me and whom i have soothed at every thorny obstruction  a companion who has fed with me equally cheerful whether upon sour or palatable fruit  a companion with whom i have strewed roses and gathered thistles   lovely woman when thou art used kindly how ductile is thy disposition how easy thy belief how forgiving thy temper  i have lost said i by inattention an opportunity of enjoying the sweetest commerce of life  i have lost the conversation of a beautiful and wellbred woman  with her my soul should have experienced every mortal pleasure and my senses have participated in the possession even to ecstasy   here my lord coke came across me but his black letter made no impression upon my ideas  counselor h  rg  e recommends the author to read his edition of coke upon littleton seventeen numbers of which he has translated from the opake distorted character of the old editions in less than six years   o woman beauty is thy peculiar prerogative  why art thou so severely censured for indiscretions why should one false step for ever damn thy fame when all your errors are of nature and education   formed for love molded for pleasure with a soul warm and a heart melting with sensibility   then ye mothers do ye not train up your daughters from their very infancy in the business of love  does not their grace their dressing and their studies soften and prepare them for tender impressions  then your virtues how they have been traduced  but i will defend them if not by argument by paraphrase  a paraphrase who when bethulias city was besieged preserved her fellowcitizen from utter ruin  woman  judith the wife of an obscure man whilst the city was attacked by holofernes general to nebuchadonosor she went to his tent as if intending to satisfy his lust but the general getting drunk and falling asleep she cut off his head and returning to the city by her exhortations prevailed upon her fellowcitizens to attack his camp which they did discomfiting his whole army   who from a state of servitude and bondage delivered israels children  woman  deborah the prophetess and jahel her friend   who with religious filial zeal unheard before offered up her life a sacrifice to heaven to save a fathers vow  woman  this was the daughter of jephtha but some authors say her sacrifice was much severer than death  a vow of perpetual chastity    who in the midst of flying arrows headed a beauteous female troop of romans mounted on palfreys and in gay array crossed without dread old tibers silver flood and left porsenna wondering at the action  woman  this was celia a beautiful young roman lady who had been made prisoner with several female companions   who in heroic grief eat burning coals resolving with a brave intrepid spirit not to servive her lord  woman  portia wife to brutus daughter to cato   who when her husband brave macronius died fighting for freedem against palmyras tyrant roused to the war the sons of liberty and conquered all the east  woman  zenobia   so much for courage now for chastity   did not lucretia stab herself to vindicate her honor  did not portia accept death from the hands of octavius the tribune in preference to adultery  sophronia illustrious roman stabbed herself to avoid the brutal passion of maxentius  then there is susannah whose virtue repelled the amorous solicitations of two  old men   but the catologue i have collected of brave virtuous learned generous women of all countries and of all complexions were i to give it here would swell my book to such enormous magnitude as would frighten even those few friends who have promised to read it   on returning to my inn from the terrace i found the cloth laid and the apparatus for eating prepared and laid out with that neatness and regularity which by indicating a cleanliness in the cookery gives a kind of invitation to eat heartily  but i had no appetite for eating and dinner not being quite ready i took a file of newspapers that lay upon the window and throwing myself upon a couch read what follows   the public ledger aquatic sports of all sports whether by land or by water there never was a sport nor there never will be a sport equal to the delightful sport of swanhopping  i have been on a party with my lord praetor  sat near my lady praetor and had the honor of tipping a hobnob with miss praetor   every thing glided on smooth as the thames which bore us upon his unruffled bosom till we got to stains  we drank copiously without danger of suffocation  we eat plentifully without danger of choking  we sung we danced and cracked bon mots without interruption till we got near stains  few of us were halfseas over   we were near stains when miss praetor in an evil minute thursting her head through the barge window and suddenly drawing it back exclaimed  mamma  beg pardon  my lady i mean  an please your ladyship i see two swans   my operar glass my lord said my lady praetor to lord praetor  my lord lugged out his opera glass and presented it with a grace  they are not swans my dear said her ladyship having fixed her glass to her eye for they have no necks  indeed mamma said miss they must be swans for see how white they are and i protest i saw their necks this instant  then i cannot see them answered my lady perhaps they have plunged their necks under water my dear remarked my lord   i will take a peep said mrs alderman haileye  i see no nothing said mrs alderman haileye  but i see something said lady praetor  and i believe they are monsters too  and i perceive them now exclaimed mrs alderman haileye  but as i am a true woman i see nothing monstrous about them  it is a natural appearance said johnny   i am now convinced they must be swans said miss taking another peep and young ones too for see mamma they have not moulted off their black down   if they be cygnets said my lord praetor we must mark them  his lordship looked out   i am surprised said my lord praetor assuming a wise and consequential grin  i am surprised that ladies who are no chickens and have experience should make such mistakes  i thought you knew things better my dear  i cannot blame the child though i called my daughter a child on this occasion yet she was full marriageable and a rich neighbor had offered his son to her but i answered sir i like your son well enough but we that is our family dont want cash do you see me but to mend the blood  my neighbor was affronted and so said he  mend your blood  damn your blood and so do you see me he went away leaving me in a horrid state of temerity  b k  t  but in truth do you see me my lady your ladyships swans are two naked men  none of your innuendors to me my lord praetor said my lady praetor as she waxed wrath or i will make your lordship know as how that when you attempt to bambozel or fun me you take the wrong sow by the ear   his lordship was struck dumb and numbed as a torpedo  miss blushed as red as port  taking a third peep she had seen her mistake  and mrs alderman haileye who had not made any mistake smiled at her triumph and looked frumpish  this is undoubtedly a predetermined scheme to affront magistracy said my lord praetor  bring the rascals before me  what as they are exclaimed her ladyship  yes as they are  as they are replied my lord   your lordship is right observed mrs alderman haileye by bringing them as they are we shall come at the naked truth  i wish they had fig leaves said johnny  a fig for your fig leaves retorted lord praetor  there are two figs for them rebutted johnny that is two figs for each figleaf surrebutted mrs alderman haileye  the men were ordered to be taken into custody   all the ladies pulled out their fans spread them before their fair foreheads holding the sticks before their eyes   the battle of stains were i a poet i would now invoke a muse of fire to describe a battle upon the water  the battle of all battles should be the battle of stains  a boat with men attendants was dispatched by my lord praetor to take into custody the two naked delinquents  but no sooner was the boat dispatched than a doubt arose about the possibility of griping them  the doubt was started by lady praetor who said addressing herself to mrs alderman haileye if they overtake these naked wretches how will they hold them  hold them said mrs alderman haileye they must hold them by the hair it was the only means adam had to hold eve or eve had to hold adam before their fall in paradise said johnny   but that cannot be done here said lady praetor for their heads are both shaved as bald as coots  their heads are shaved said miss  there is no more hair upon their heads than upon my daughters upper lip said lord praetor   miss praetor hummed and stroaked her upper lip with her forefinger   they must hold them where and how they can said mrs alderman haileye for my part it is what i would do were i on the party  pray mamma said miss pointing with her finger as if to illustrate her interrogatory  what part would you take hold of   a dead pause ensued   the boat pursued the men  the men swam from the boat  but the boat could not overtake the men  so the women were disappointed  the men took refuge under the bridge of stains   the people of stains saw the pursuit  they considered the matter as a common cause  the women of stains were melted into compassion by the danger in which they saw the naked men  they saw every thing and they felt for every thing they saw  in short the men women and children of stains let fly all kinds of missive weapons upon the deputies of my lord praetor   alderman swindle in consequence of the great courage and maneuver shown by me this day and my unparalleled condust on sundry other occasions the common council have exempted me from serving in future on any committee or in any city office and such is their respect for me that for some time past they have made it a point to let me eat drink and walk by myself and in conversation none of them ever presumes to answer me  swindle ald standing upon the poop of the city barge saw the danger which threatened lord praetors delegates  shall i exclaimed alderman swindle shall i who saw prisons burned and houses consumed stand an idle spectator while defiance is thrown in the teeth of lord praetors orders  i will fly to the bridge of stains vociferated alderman swindle and seizing a punt that lay close to the barge he paddled toward the bridge   the peasantry of stains not distinguishing the aldermans dignity by his person did not know that his person was a legal object of magisterial worship so seizing upon the stones which lay scattered on the beach and bridge attacked him in his punt from the shore and from the battlements   with his right arm the alderman wielded a mop  he levelled his mop at the mob on the bridge but the erring weapon falling short of the intended mark was seized by one of the enemy   oh for the pen of homer  the villain peasant poizing the mopstick with true rustic skill like joves lightning flying from his hand it cut the liquid air and striking upon the cranium of the magistrate must inevitably have dispatched his soul to erebus if nature from a preknowledge of this fight had not formed the head of her favorite son of genuine aldermanic mould hard and impenetrable as that which composed the caput mortuum of the styxdipped achilles  the mop rebounding from the sconce of alderman swindle fell into the water   the barge coming up the parties landed and now hostilities commenced on shore  the mob of stains surrounded the aldermanic body and if peace in likeness to a magistrate of the county had not seasonably appeared and interposed a general massacre might have ensued and the city have been left to mourn her murdered magistrates and their myrmidons   squib i have read several letters under the signature of squib in the public ledger and have always found them delectable in the perusal this writer notwithstanding the name he has assumed appears to me to possess experience ability and stability and not to be one of those young sparks who as sir archy mac sarcasm says in love a la mode go off like a squib or a cracker  ly h  u  e  portriansq     vinegaryard drury lane aug       0 dinner i had scarce finished mr squibs account of the battle of stains when dinner was served in  i sat down to eat but had no appetite  and without appetite the best meat with the most poignant sauces are insipid  in truth i had no sauce not even hunger  i always eat my meat plain but now i could not eat my plain meat   not being able to eat i called for drink  i tasted the beer  the beer was stale i tasted the cider  the cider was sour wine says the prophet makes the heart of man glad the text came across me like a cheering ray   i rung the bell and ordered a bottle of port   while the waiter was gone for the wine i recollected that though he and the rest of the family were ignorant of the ladys name and residence yet it was probable the landlord might have some knowledge of her determining to enquire i rung again to order him in but he saved me the trouble of giving orders by appearing with a bottle of port in his hand   the landlord mine host was one of those geniuses who like macklins sir pertinax mac sycophant depended more upon bowing than on education and natural abilities he could never stand straight in the presence of a guest and to the pliability of sir pertinax he added the complaisance of shakespeares polonius being ever of the same opinion with the person he conversed with unless that person was his wife or one of his servants and these he eternally contradicted whether they were right or whether they were wrong   mine host having made half a dozen obsequious bows and eyed me from head to foot with the circumspection of a sergeant eying a young recruit cautiously wiped the dust from the bottle viewing it at the same time with an expressive look which fully evinced he would have me understand the wine was old   it will bear the decanter said i  i pledge my life upon it sir said mine host drawing forth the cork with a jerk attended by a smack from his mouth accompanied by a smack from the bottle which not only advertised me of the length of the cork but of the good opinion which the landlord entertained of his liquor   there is not better port in the kings cellar said my landlord winking i can take upon me to say that if the landlord by this expression and wink meant to insinuate that his port had ever been in the kings cellar he was an imposing rascal for ever since i came to superintend the household i have taken special care not only of whole bottles and whole joints but of pieces of bottles and broken victuals  t  lb  t  filling out a glass and presenting it to me  it is all flavor like an olive and is bright as a ruby said he holding the glass between his eye and the window  i tasted the port  it was tart  it would not do  the landlord bowed moving his head in a manner that i might take either as a polite assent or humble contradiction of my opinion but at the same time laying his hand upon his breast swore it was two years in in bottle  i tasted the port again as a complimentary return to his bow but before i could take the glass from my lips he assured my honor that the prince of wales had drank of and approved this very wine   i felt the full force of the compliment and of the recommendation the compliment deserved a return and the recommendation it was not in my power to controvert so returning  your honor with a nod of approbation and giving up my taste to the palate of the prince of wales i swallowed what remained in the glass   flattery the manner in which my landlord had recommended his port was irresistible and perhaps had i changed the bottle for another i should have got worse wine with more bows and an assurance that his majesty had drank a bottle from the same bin  there would have been no withstanding the force of royal authority it is astonishing what an influence royal authority has upon the human mind  i do not mean in politics though heaven knows we have quacks enough in both houses pretending to administer medicines to the consumptive constitution of the state  but i mean its operation in favor of the slow poisons which are daily administered by quack doctors and which have no virtue but what they derive from the use of the kingsarms  anonymous  but growing impatient to enquire after my fair fellowtraveller my honor condescended to ask my landlord to take a glass which after half a dozen bows he accepted  yet by heaven the wine was sour but flattery took off its tartness  and no wonder flattery should vitiate the taste when we know its baneful effects upon all the other senses  where is there a philosopher however cynical who cannot through some medium be approached by flatterys honied influence flattery is the touch that proves the value and purity of the understanding   gold tries the integrity of the heart  flattery the strength of the brain   where is the king who can withstand or when was there a king who could withstand unmoved the adulating baseness of the flattering vermin tribe the best monarchs have been undone by such miscreants they have converted the worst into devils   detraction my landlord being seated and i having described my fellowtraveller to him as minutely as possible expatiating upon her perfections as i touched upon them that is such of her perfections as distinguished her from the rest of her sex for there are perfections common to them all  i say having minutely described my fellowtraveller to my landlord he run over a catalogue of the beauties of windsor and the adjacent country which he had at his tongues end with a most surprising flow of volubility accuracy of description point of sarcasm and now and then the sweetness of eulogium   if it was not for her black hair said my landlord i should be positive she was miss a   miss b  is too proud to travel in a stagecoach  therefore it cannot be miss b   the widow c  has not been in london since her husbands death he was buried on monday besides i know she had a private cardparty last night so it is impossible your honor that this lady should be the widow c   there is a young lady in the neighborhood who answers your description but she is continually practicing smiles before the glass to ensnare the prince  no  no  it is not miss d   you say sir the lady is wellshaped and witty  now if her back was broke from her wit i should really think she was mrs e   miss f  has a roguish eye  but your ladys eyes are blue and miss fs are black and she squints with her left eye and is ever speaking scandal so it cannot be miss f   if miss g  had not slipped her ancle as many ladies have since the huntingseason commenced  you understand me  green gowns have been very fashionable in the neighborhood of windsor since hunting became the sport of the great   in short my host took great pains to inform me that the lady i enquired after was neither mrs nor miss nor the widow a b c d e f g etc etc etc and this he did wherever he had opportunity with a malignant stroke of detraction   the fellow had a tongue of charcoal with which he burned or blackened the reputation of every person she spoke of  wherever he gave credit for a virtue or good action he never failed to balance the account at the debit side of the book  with an insiduous hint or charge of defamation   i changed the subject of conversation   politics i suppose said i pointing to the ledger which i had thrown aside when dinner was served in i suppose my friend that since the court has honored windsor with the light of its countenance the inhabitants have become profound politicians  i am of no party answered my landlord  though to be sure what with excise and what with quartering of soldiers a publican can scarce live   but as taxes rise you charge in proportion said i   true sir replied my landlord we charge in proportion but then our guests eat and drink in proportion they order as little as possible and eat as much as possible that is when they are charged for each article  but sir  if they dine at the ordinary or agree for so much a head they eat as if it was the last meal they had to devour and scarcely drink sufficient to wash the food down their throats  alas sir i have had very few good companies in the drinking way since the last general election and those who drank then drank at the expense of the candidates   and what was your opinion on that election said i   opinion  o your honor i never formed any opinion on it  a man who depends upon the custom of the public should never have an opinion of his own  i am not one of those publicspirited publicans who neglect their own business to look after the affairs of the state  it is true i hear a great deal of talk among my guests about the kings friends and opposition  now your kings friends i take to be those who are friends to themselves  with success  and opposition i take to be those who have been friends to themselves  without success  there ever was and there ever will be parties your honor  those in will grin and those out will pout  and as to our great speechifiers the more they say whether in or out of place the less i believe them we have senators whose eloquence is not less admirable than their fortitude who know the principles and desend the rights of human nature who possess virtue equal to their genius and who prefer their honor to all the riches which ambitious meanness can extort  edmund burke  i admire an irresistible eloquence never prostituted to falsehood or denied to truth for such eloquence must convince every mind not debased by voluntary and incorrigible error  george savile  eloquence in the hands of a good man is the most glorious gift of nature it makes him the sanctuary of the unfortunate the protector of the weak the support and praise of the honest and eternal terror and control of the bad  camden    but let who will be in or who will be out it is all the same to me and if your honor wishes to know how the election was carried on in windsor here your honor look to that there ledger and it will inform you   so saying he took up the ledger and laid it before me on the table and after half a dozen of bows told me he would go and make every possible enquiry to find out the lady   a soliloquy those in will grin  those out will pout  well said landlord  i have read machiavel sidney lock swift hume johnson and a hundred other authors and arguers in politics on both sides of the question and after all my reading my landlord who probably has not read a hundred pages since he left school is as sound a judge of politics and politicians as i am  his adage includes the whole system  those in will grin those out will pout   it should be engraven in brass and hung up over the entrance of the temple of corruption my house was a house of prayer but lo ye have made it a den of thieves  st stephen    o blessed liberty let me here pay a tribute at thy shrine  hymn to liberty this hymn was written by an irish curate of great learning  n b  it is thought he will never rise in the church  m   sister of jove ethereal flame who bidst the

suppressed   the soliloqy continued why should i be so anxious why so dull continued i reasoning with myself heaviness of spirit is an evidence of folly and the most manifest sign of wisdom is a cheerful mind  this landlord of mine without the aid of literature knows the very depth and main spring of politics and without the aid of philosophic study has discovered the very perfection of all it can teach  that the perfection of wisdom is to be merry and content for the seat of wisdom is always clear and serene   give me then that philosophy and let me ever study those precepts and those precepts alone which teach me to live with cheerfulness and show me how to die without concern  save me from subtilties which only distract the understanding without improving the heart demetrius the grammarian finding in the temple of delphos a knot of philosophers in cheerful conversation said to them either i am much deceived or by your cheerful and pleasant countenances you are not engaged in any deep discourse to which heraclean the magician replied it is for such as are puzzled about enquiring whether the future tense of the verb  be spelled with a double l or that hunts after the derivation of the comparatives  and the superlatives  to knit their brows in their discourses upon science but as to philosophical discourses they always divert and cheer up those they entertain and never deject them or make them sad  you may read this in our countenances  johnson of the lexicon  harris of the hermes   as i am no philosopher no more than our author the impressions of passion do not operate superficially upon me but penetrate even to the seat of reason  lady gr  us  r     make me honest kind heaven and you make me equal to any situation in life  and having made me honest i have no objection to your making me great  for honesty can enjoy riches power authority and honors with as much integrity as she can suffer poverty oppression slavery and disgrace  she can sleep upon a bed of down as soundly as she can sleep upon a truss of straw  she can be innocent in a palace as in a cottage and show as much humility in a glorious equipage as when she walks barefoot upon the highway  but when honesty finds herself elevated in life then her peculiar office is to know the use and how to use the good things she possesses and her peculiar virtue to part with them without murmuring i am intimately acquainted with a welsh gentleman who fully answers this description  the great admire him the poor respect and love him  w w win   having eased my mind by a few minutes reflection  i took up the ledger and read   electioneering intelligence extraordinary lord praetor lady praetor and miss praetor were sitting at table enjoying the sweets of domestic tranquillity over the remnant of a pint bottle of port having just swallowed the secondhand fragments of a recooked mutton hash when an attendant entered and delivered a letter into lord praetors hand  his lordship looking eagerly upon the seal gave a sudden start  his eyes stood fixed in their orbits and those masticators which but the moment before had cooperated in assaulting the mutton hash regardless of their natural alliance assaulted each other with reiterated violence his lordship broke open the letter and fixing his eyes upon the superscription an universal ague instantly took possession of his nervous system each cold fit being succeeded with a most violent paroxysm of heat   lady praetor and miss were all attention  his lordship read on   papas all in a muck my dear whispered lady praetor to miss  yes my lady answered miss in the same tone  there is something in the wind replied miss  there is something in the wind rejoined my lady taking a pinch of snuff i  smell a rat  odd rat it exclaimed my lord i have been alarmed my dear into a pispiration  never was i in such a quandary before  lady praetor took up the letter and read   now my lord praetors face during his confusion neither blushed red like the declining sun nor grew pale like the rising moon yet his lordships face had a celestial appearance  it reflected a thousand colors like an aurora borealis or in more homely phrase my lord praetors phiz while he perused this mandatory letter for such it was looked like the welkin when the merry dancers prance and caper upon her bosom till after exhibiting a variety of dies it settled in a color something between madder red and coventry blue   this letter must be obeyed said lady praetor throwing the letter upon the table this was a commandatory letter ordering lord praetor to exert his whole interest against a popular candidate   this letter must be obeyed echoed my lord praetor pushing the letter toward miss   this letter must be obeyed reechoed miss praetor who had read it over her mammas shoulder  but how can it be obeyed said my lord praetor  i cannot be in two places at once  but your lordship papa may get into three places by obeying it said miss  i am to preside in the city upon friday said my lord  then i will go to vindsor myself offered my lady  i can manage a poll as well as your lordship  i know your ladyship can my love said lord praetor   what colored ribbands shall we wear enquired miss  none of their city colors i hope one alderman has already mounted blue cockades  then i will go to vindsor myself said my lord  since there are blue cockades in the city i will go to vindsor for i would rather face the devil than a blue cockade many animals have a particular aversion to particular colors thus a turkeycock has an aversion to red and it lately appeared that the board of aldermen and westminster justices showed a horrid aversion to blue  anonymous  i will appoint a locum trimmings to fill the city chair  i wish he may trim the plebeians well said lady praetor  this election business will make us up if we succeed said lady praetor  and get a star and garter at least for papa observed miss  no man could become the star and garter better said my lady my lady praetor said no more than i merited  no man ever became the bar of the star and garter better than i did and if his grace my neighbor had not paid high i should never have left my tavern which his grace thought a nuisance to turn vinemerchant  o i wish i may become the bar of the kings bench where next term i am to receive sentence as well as i became the bar of the star and garter  b k    miss pursued the subject  i wish said miss praetor  i wish there was an order of knights for ladies good lud mamma we might be knighted  o gemini papa how the gentlemen would admire at seeing our stars and garters as we walked  humph said my lord with a grin but you are innocent my dear and as the french mottor has it  honey sweat key meal with pence  but as this is to be a gratus business we shall have no occasion for our own carriage and horses we will have a postcoach from the swan with two necks i will have nothing that has any thing to do with a swan said my lady  we have had enough of swanhopping already added miss   then my dear said lord praetor we will have a carriage from the bell and savage and the landlords four bobtail bays to draw us  bob me none of your bobtails my lord exclaimed lady praetor i am not to be bobbed out of my dignity in that manner neither  i will have my own carriage and long tails  well now mamma said miss praetor joining in the conversation with a smile ineffable  well now though i acknowledge longtails carry the belle in the city yet for a country excursion give me cocktails against the globe  cocktails are the very thing mamma  indeed they are all the ton nothing but cocktails go down in the vis a vis line at the west end of the town   i will yet have a phiz a vee said lady praetor  but consider my dear continued her ladyship we are going on business that requires solemnity and procession and the longtails are best at slow going   true mamma replied miss but then the present business requires expedition and in a quick trot or canter the cocktails have every advantage  but my dear the flowing manes on the necks of the longtails look so grand said my lady  true mamma but the cocktails carry their heads so prettily   come come my love said lord praetor venturing to put in a word you are the best judge of the subject  what say you my dear  longtails or cocktails for the journey  i wish to oblige the child answered lady praetor but this time i must have my own way the next bout i will indulge her taste for cocktails but this bout i will indulge my own taste and drive with longtails   my lord praetor and miss acquiesced   things being thus adjusted and the coach at the door ready to drive for windsor not according to the old saying cocktail every yard but longtail every inch her ladyship as she stepped into the carriage called out to the coachman vindsor a hoi john  my dear said lord praetor we are not going in the city barge   plague on the city barge ejaculated lady praetor  ever since our last unfortunate voyage in it to stains i can never get the adventures of the day out of my head  nor can i get any thing else into my head said miss  poor alderman swindle got a mopstick on his head said my lord   rattle rattle rattle over the stones to hydepark corner   kensington  hammersmith in a long trot   kewbridge in a canter   windsor in full gallop   huzza huzza huzza windsor windsor   no keppel no keppel roared my lord from the right side of the coach   no keppel no keppel roared my lady from the left side   miss sat ruminating on the necks of the windsor swans   the coach having stopped my lord went to the hustings beribbanded and cockaded my lady went canvassing  and miss whose mind was pregnant with the idea of the swans she had seen on the expedition to stains took a solitary walk by the thames side to speculate upon the beautiful productions of nature  every stable and outhouse that could be procured in windsor was divided and subdivided to create votes against admiral keppel  admiral keppel was ousted from representing the borough of windsor  so he went into surry and was elected by the free suffrages of the independent freeholders to represent the county   the message i had scarcely laid down the ledger when my servant entered the room  his mouth extended to the dimension of a countertenor choiristers mouth when vociferating o thou that brings glad tidings to sion  he bounced in sans ceremony and rubbing the palms of his hand together with a quickness and zeal that intimated good news and satisfaction told me he had found the lady   and where is she and what is her name said i leaping from my chair with the utmost eagerness  i cannot say sir answered my servant where the lady is or who the lady is but a boy waits to deliver a letter to the gentleman who came down in the stage he says it is from a lady  and as i came down an outside passenger it cannot be for me  and as you sir were the only gentlemen inside passenger i conclude it must be for you   i ordered the boy to be called in   he was a lad about fourteen in a neat frock livery  i have a letter sir said the boy without a direction but my mistress has ordered me to deliver it to the gentleman who came to windsor this day in the stage  i held out my hand for the letter tore it open and read   i impute your omitting to enquire after my name to emotions similar to those which agitated my bosom at the minute of our departure and i suppose you have been traveling over the whole town to find me out  it is what i should have been doing said i stamping and cursing my remissness and stupidity  if a more serious engagement does not call for your attendance i shall hope for your company as soon after you receive this as convenient and you must conduct yourself before those you will see with me as an old acquaintance  maria  my respects said i to your mistress slipping a trifle into the boys hand  i shall wait upon her immediately  the boy retired  in about ten minutes i was dressed  these ten minutes appeared an hour  in twenty minutes was at the house  never did necessitous tradesman going humbly to petition a privileged great man to pay a small debt of long standing feel a more general agitation of nerves or knock with a more trembling hand than i felt and than i knocked with at the door of marias lodgings  the meeting turning my head aside accidentally as i knocked at the door i saw maria peep over the windowblind but when showed into the parlour i found her sitting with her back turned toward the door a book in her hand supporting herself by her elbow which rested on the arm of the chair she was seemingly so lost in meditation that had i not seen her peep over the parlourblind i should have thought she had neither heard me coming in nor had seen me when i was in  i gave a loud hem  the boy announced my entrance  the gentleman madam and he withdrew   maria started from her seat as roused from a reverie  i should have suspected her of duplicity but the crimson glow that flushed in her cheek convinced me that the pretended reverie was not a maneuver of experience or practiced art but an immediate consequence of amiable confusion   the moment our eyes met i perceived and felt for marias situation  suspicion fled and the ardour of passion which succeeded was instantly checked by the interposition of sentiment  my eyes bent downwards  the confusion which revelled in her cheek had raised a tumult within her bosom  our feelings were mutual  our hands guided by instinctive attraction joined imperceptibly till a reciprocal gentle pressure convinced us of their junction  passion stepped in again but sentiment still kept her post  we sighed at one instant as with one breath  at one instant we received relief  yet to speak was impossible  though marias eyes expressed unutterable things  mine perhaps were not without expression  at least maria has since told me so   i had always an aversion to punctilio  no man in the world understands less or pays less attention to those who practice ettiquette than i do  but ceremony in the present instance was out of the question nature predominated and under her sweet influence i led the lady to her chair placed her on it and placing myself upon another chair close by her without uttering a single compliment or a single bow or courtsey being passed on my part or here is   i led her to her chair grace was in all her steps grace which the vestris could never teach nor nobility could never learn  for it is neither to be taught nor learned  it was the grace of nature if you were to see my little memorandum book you would acknowledge notwithstanding the above insinuation that i taught several ladies the true natural grace and have received large emoluments for teaching the same but the contents of this little book i shall keep secret till safe upon the continent when i shall publish it as a grateful return for all favors received from the ladies of great britain and that my gratitude may not hereafter be called in question i have added to my catalogue many favors which i never received but which shall also be published  the vestris   it was such grace as her grace the duchess of d  nor her grace the duchess of r  never exhibited in public no not even when led out by the first dancers of the court to walk the minuet de la cour  but when his grace the duke of d  or his grace the duke of r  lead forth the partners of their love in private to practice the minuet de la coeur no doubt their graces then may show as graceful a deportment as now gracefully marked the person and steps of my maria but i have seen a lady whose name is grace whose person is grace whose face is grace  but above all whose mind is grace itself  good heaven if she would but smile graciously upon me    two minuets passed without a word being uttered  they were golden minuets worth a whole iron age   maria had dropped her book from her hand as it approached mine  the book lay upon the ground i took it up  it was tristram shandy   tristram shandy had stern madam said i as i opened the book  had stern experienced such a tender meeting as the present he could have written a whole volume upon the text   i was considering answered maria when you came in what a pity it was that stern lest the description of the widow wadmans person and beauty to the imagination of his reader and had not drawn the ladys picture himself  alas madam said i had stern drawn the widows picture it would only have increased his enemies and heaven knows the benignity of his heart and simplicity of his manners had raised enough of them  his description madam would have pleased few but himself the critics would have fallen foul upon it would have dissected it to a hair have tortured it limb by limb bedaubed it and besmutted it for in the article of beauty we seldom find two men who think alike some admire slender some admire full waists one of the first personages in this country indulging with me in the amorous dalliance of a retired tete a tete gave me his opinion upon this subject he declared his dislike to the antiquated figures of former days described by pope small by degrees and beautifully less exclaiming at the same time in rapture  give me quantity  i despise quality give me latitude and longitude in love  armstead spinster  a tint in the complexion or a shade in the color of the eye settles the admiration and gives birth to passion  it is the same with women answered maria they are equally capricious in their likings and affections  some women like tall men  others like middlesized and some like short men   being short myself i made a low bow   your observation madam said i is just an inch this way  or an inch that way  may gain or lose the affections of a woman  and as to the affections of men they are not confined to beauty to figure or mental acplishments i have often remarked old men fond of green girls and young fellows giving preference to fullblown beauty  but these are false appetites   false appetites exclaimed maria starting and looking toward heaven  alas sir it is too true that the devastation in the gardens of beauty and innocence are generally made by old wretches  her bosom heaved as if bursting  her whole frame was in agitation  i finished the sentence for her  old wretches who lay waste but cannot enjoy the soil we have remarked two old fellows of this diabolical cast who constantly take their evening amusement during the summer season in vauxhall gardens and who in winter have old haradans in constant pay priestesses to satan at whose shrine they nightly offer up human sacrifices  f  l  h and h  s  g   a shower of tears burst from marias eyes and stole down her cheek i wiped them off  but not with a handkerchief   a shandean conversation perceiving the distress of my fair friend though unable to account for the cause the history of maria shall be given in the course of this work if the reviewers will but assist the sale of the first volume by abusing it  the author  i changed the subject by taking up tristram shandy which i had laid upon the parlourwindow and accidentally opening the page where the author promises a chapter upon buttonholes it is a pity said i turning to maria and affecting a sprightliness to relieve her spirits  it is a pity said i that tristram never filled this chapter  do you mean the black leaf said maria  i answered no   i could never penetrate into the moral of that dark page said maria   i do believe said i it is an emblem of the black ingratitude of the world  then continued maria since you do not mean the black you must mean the marble page and that page is to me as inexplicable as the other   i do not think answered i that there is any great difficulty to unravel the truths which lie mystically hid under the veil of the marble page  i consider it as a true picture of the hard marble heads and hard marble hearts of those envious dull ones who persecuted him while living and pray add said maria of those unfeeling dull ones who could not understand or benefit by reading the dictates of his philanthropy   i resumed the subject of the buttonhole   had he filled his chapter upon buttonholes said i it would have been delectable   he would have filled it in all probability observed maria but poor fellow you should recollect his misfortune  you should recollect he was grievously afflicted with a consuming asthma the whole time he was composing his works   i see the force of your observation said i a man debilitated as he must have been with death pursuing him at every step and shaking his dart at him upon every turn had something more material to employ his mind and of course employ his pen than such trifling subjects as buttonholes  true said maria but come you appear in perfect health and spirits so let me see what you can say upon the subject  here  is a blank page continued maria taking tristram shandy out of my hand  here is a white blank page turning over to chapter xxxviii in the ivth volume come i will have an immediate proof of your literary abilities   so saying she brought pen and ink and placing the blank chapter in shandy before me on a table  write write said maria while i go order tea   the buttonhole a buttonhole what could stern possibly have said upon a buttonhole  would he have entered into its origin  would he have described it with all its appendages and ornaments  would he have explained its uses its shape and its component parts  would he have given us all those ideas which must consequently have arisen before his minds eye in the course of considering and discussing the subject  heaven only knows whether he would have done all which these interrogatories enquire but clear i am that had he once taken the subject in hand he would have done his best and the best can do no more though the subject to be handled was the best in christendom this is the meritricious coloring of eloquence  th  rl  w cancel   but as i am not endowed with powers natural nor acquired corporeal nor intellectual sufficient to support me should i rashly attempt to enter into so deep and profound a subject a subject which would baffle the pens of the royal society or sorbonne  a subject which has exhausted whole folios of learning and employed the leisure hours of the most learned men  i will not presume madam to inform you what a buttonhole is though having seen many and felt more i will venture to tell you what a buttonhole is like   the buttonhole of a pocket being vertical is like a parenthesis closed thus     the buttonhole of the breast being horizontal is also like a parenthesis but inversed thus    view a buttonhole which way you will  change its position ever so often  take it in whatever manner you please  it is a parenthesis still   split the word parenthesis in twain and by the addition of one letter t you have a double illustration of this dark subject   the first syllable will be parent now a buttonhole is a parent for by a proper use of it in conjunction with a button it nourishes a man by keeping him warm in cold weather  the second syllable will be thesis now the buttonhole is a thesis which has produced much dispute in the world nam fuit ante helenam  cunnus causa deterrima bellis for my part i know nothing of the theory but being naturally of an aguish constitution am liable to hotfits and coldfits which cause me to button or unbutton as i am hot or cold i have had my share of buttonholepractics   and pray sir who first made use of buttonholes   with submission to their reverences who are bound ex officio to understand these things better than laymen i suppose that the button and buttonhole is as ancient as adam and eve and were first used by them in joining their fig leaves together for as our first parents had neither needle nor thread is it possible the use of something like a button and buttonhole was discovered by them   and why not a needle and thread sir might not adam procure a thorn for eve to serve as a needle and might not eve give a lock of her hair to serve as a thread and this needle and thread being thus procured it is not possible or at least probable that adam and eve stitched their fig leaves together  whether they buttoned or stitched their fig leaves together in my opinion does not signify a farthing  but the learned hebraists think otherwise several men of extensive learning have written whole volumes in controverting such essential points of scripture and frequently preach upon them to the great entertainment of themselves and punishment of their auditors  p  r  y d d in his collection of old ballads   put in the button xxxxxxxxxxxxxxs it will be matter of great doubt to future generations whether these xs mean the crosses attending buttons and buttonholes or whether they represent the number of times a ladys ridinghabit ought to be buttoned in the year  i say future generations for my book will be read while buttons and buttonholes are in being which will be when junius etc etc shall be forgotten  the author  here having filled the blankleaf i could proceed no further so turned it down that maria might peruse it at her leisure  two characters maria returned just as i had closed the book and desired me to follow her repeating her caution that i should conduct myself as an old acquaintance  she ushered me into a drawing room neatly furnished in the old style the chairbottoms the curtains and even the pictures were of needle work  the floor which was of old oak glistered with a burnished luster and every article of the furniture had from frequent friction acquired a shining polish in one corner stood a tambourframe in another corner an aparatus for painting  a gray parrot occupied a window on the right a breedingcage of canarybirds occupied a window on the left and on a large marble slabtable which stood under a long oldfashioned pierglass two turtles billed and cooed in amorous dalliance   there were also two tabbycats their fur unsullied as ermine purring by the sireside and a little french lapdog with his companion big with pup slumbered upon a cushion  the lady of the mansion exhibited as evident marks of female industry as her furniture every article of her dress at least every thing that appeared was ornamented with needle work and though in dishabille all was neat and pinned on with a systematic accuracy   this lady was tall and slender her waist scarce a span her face forming an accute angle at the chin her nose prominent and her skin tight to her cheekbones as if braced out of those wrinkles which a few treacherous gray hairs peeping from under a black wig informed the beholder it was entitled to  she had but one eye but then that eye projected so far from out its socket and had such a convenient power of turning on its swivel though there is no name mentioned here yet we are clearly of opinion that an information will lie in banco regis provided any lady living in windsor will swear she believes herself to be the person alluded to  wall  s at g ma  d sl g  some time ago the above learned gentlemen in argument at the bar maintained that swivels and guns were entirely different things i in answer insisted that though all guns were not swivels yet all swivels were guns and illustrated by observing that all swiveleyes were eyes though all eyes were not swiveleyes  the learned gentlemen looking in each others face were convinced   j d  nn  g  that it kept constant guard upon her blind side and was mistress of a perpetual motion which gave it all the qualities of the hundred eyes of argus for it took within its pupil which was ornamented with a small pearl contrasting a coral circle that embraced the ball not only every object in front but every object on each side  having sketched out this virgins person for she was unmarried had preserved an untainted fame and was not one of those hypocrites who have no pretense to chastity themselves but by their severity to the impure  i must say something of her mind with which i soon became intimately acquainted she was a wit a satyrist a critic and a writer with a tongue ever pretending service to her neighbors but in its qualities contrary to that of the fox which heals whereas the tongue of miss verjuce operated upon a character as the medicine of a pretending quack operates upon the body and never parted it till as the devil left job the tortured character became a sore all over   with this damsel sat a military gentleman not less than sixty whose regimentals of scarlet faced with green velvet exhibited the fashionable cut of twenty years past  his stature was tall his shoulders broad his appearance dignified his eye penetrating and his face though furrowed by time wore a smile of pleasantry that showed he had grown old with good humor and could support age with a good grace a vernacular broad pronunciation declared him an irishman and his attentive politeness soon convinced me he had held a commission of rank in a foreign service he bore a deep scar upon his forehead in testimony of his courage and the croix de st louis pending from his buttonhole by a ribband evinced his having received at least an honorary reward from the prince under whose standard he had fought   on this object the eye of miss verjuce kept continual play which was returned by an assiduous attention to please on the part of the man of war  she was his admirer he pretended to be here is and she believed him from the favorable opinion she entertained of her merits  o vanity thou art a fault of the first magnitude in woman  the cause of her greatest misfortunes  even poverty is not a greater enemy to her honor  and never had woman a greater share of vanity than the woman i have described  she was vain of her understanding but that was excusable her glass could not show its deformity  she was vain of her person that was astonishing for the sight of it must have reproved and humbled her every time she sat at her toilet  teatablechat the captain soon discovered i was his countryman and no sooner made the discovery than he discharged a volley of interrogatories at me in succession as quick as a feu de joy   merciful heaven captain exclaimed miss verjuice a cessation of questions and let the conversation be general  pray sir continued she turning full upon me is there any likelihood that the present unnatural war will have a speedy termination   in addition to other qualifications miss verjuice was a politician   unnatural war said the captain repeating the word unnatural with marked emphasis  madam it is not possible that a war by which so many men get their livelihood can be unnatural   nor the instruments of the war neither i suppose replied miss verjuice  you captain took a very natural part in the last war  sighting against you king and against your country  this was the shot of an invenomed arrow but integrity which sat upon the captains heart repelled it  he saw the malignity of the intention and warmed with an honest ardour not to resent the injury but to defend his honor   i fought for bread and for reputation madam answered the captain  the laws of my country deprived me of my inheritance but they could not humble my spirit  born a gentleman i scorned to degenerate into any other character  a passion for same said maria is the instinct of all great souls  i bowed to maria she construed my bow into an approbation of her sentiment but it was in fact a bow of gratitude for the compliment she paid my countryman   the captain went on  i sought for bread i fought for reputation and the instant i could acquire bread and reputation under the government of my own country i returned to her bosom returned with as ardent affection heaven knows as ever lover returned with to the bosom of his mistress  miss verjuice for an instant relaxed her muscles  but while government precluded me from going to heaven by the road which the souls of my ancestors had traveled i could not fight for that government with zeal even if she had accepted my service  miss verjuice again braced up her muscles  and you thought purgatory said miss verjuice the high road to heaven and gave up your estate in this world sooner than you would subscribe to the geography of the other world as laid down by the law  do you not think it strange sir continued this amiable virgin turning her eye upon me that a man bred to the sword and who has been spreading desolation over the face of the earth should have so tender a conscience   i would have answered the lady  but there was no stopping the tide of the captains volubility his face glowed scarlet  his eyes darted lightning  he rose from his chair and throwing himself into the attitude of a cicero addressed miss verjuice  you are a woman madam  and do not understand the duty of a soldier nor the honorable purposes of war  the duty of a soldier madam is to support justice and do injury to no man  to maintain truth and aid virtue  and let me tell you madam that to repress the wild fury of lawless invaders and by force to extirpate wickedness and oppression from the face of the earth has never been accounted violence or spreading desolation in any country or language  robbers may be subdued by force or death if other means fail those who invade private property may be compelled to restitution at the bar of justice but if independent states have injured us to what bar shall we cite them who shall constrain them to appear at our summons or if they should appear who shall oblige them to abide by our sentence  open force then must be the dernier resort and who will be base or mean enough to say that under such circumstances war is not just  you are so eloquent and energetic in your eloquence captain said miss verjuice that it is really a pity you are not in the house to aid the phalanx of speaking admirals and generals   the captain had spent many years in france he took the compliment literally bowed in return and laying his hand upon his heart swore he would prefer serving his country in the field   miss verjuice would have replied but the captain had not exhausted his oratory   the enemies of great britain and ireland vociferated the captain have in the present war acted with treachery and should be punished  let every soldier raising his hand as if to stimulate the ranks  let every soldier raise in himself a noble manly enthusiasm  you fight in the cause of virtue justice and freedom no one is going to fight said miss verjuice but the captain was not to be interrupted  he galloped on  animated by this divine principle what wonders have not britons performed how have they risen terrors of the earth the protectors of the oppressed the avengers of justice and scourge of tyrants  how have the sons of rapine sunk before them confounded and overthrown  witness ye danube and sombre crimsoned with blood  let france let spain germany and both the indies bear witness  what was it fired british kings and generals  alfred  william  henry  george  marlborough granby  cumberland  wolf and ligonier  i will tell you said miss verjuice it was the justice of their cause and an unconquerable passion for liberty   this unexpected stroke of anticipation cut down the captain  he suddenly fell back in his chair   miss verjuice could not bear to lose the advantage of her cut  she followed her blow  there was a loud explosion in your fire captain said miss verjuice  but the charge was government powder   i felt for the captain so changed the subject  there are but few of our countrymen now said i in foreign service  i know but of two answered the captain  oricly who is in the service of spain and odunn who is in the service of france   do you mean the sieur oricly said miss verjuice who went ambassador from madrid to paris  i do madam answered the captain and count odunn who was dispatched from paris to negociate with the queen of portugal on the armed neutrality   there were accounts of those negotiations i believe said maria published in the prints  true madam said the captain i was present at orielys interview with the french king and went with odunn into portugal from whence i came to london  it was i wrote and sent the accounts to the public ledger under the head extract of a letter from paris i have both it is very probable this extract of a letter from paris is as authentic as most extracts from foreign letters are  the majority of which are written in london about me and if you please ladies to hear them the young gentleman pointing to me will be kind enough to read for your amusement   the ladies thanked the captain  he took the papers from his pockets and handing them to me i read   the sieur orielys negotiation the most extraordinary intelligence that ever was published within the walls of paris or ever set the spirits of frenchmen upon the wing has been published within these few days  the victories of edward and henry of england did not astonish the french nation so much nor did the conquests of lewis the xivth give the french people half the satisfaction as they received from the capture of the english merchantmen it was as novel as it was unexpected  half the people in france will be ruined by the expense of rejoicings  every house was open all the bells were ringing  men women and children of all denominations trades and professions danced caperd jiggd it and skipd about with the agility of beniventos devils  what with fireworks and illuminations bonfires and transparent paintings rockets squibs and crackers discharges from the artillery feus de joye from the small arms and huzzaing from the mob not only the city of paris but the whole country round looked and sounded like hell itself  all was fire and clatter  te deums in every church   the court was met upon the occasion of the glad tidings when a grandee of spain whiskered up to the eyebrows  gloved up to the elbows  cuffed up to the arms booted up to the hips with a coat which fell short of his hams a waistcoat that reached to his knees and spurred upon each heel like a gamecock arrived express from madrid with a letter congratulatory from his most catholic majesty   the grandee wore a thundering black perriwig bushy at the sides with a ramillie tail down to his crupper and had belted round his waist a basket toledo in the hilt of which was deposited his handkerchief   the grandee of spain was announced to the court by the gentleman usher as the sieur oriely  the sieur oriely entered the instant his name was announced the most christian king having just time to take his throne  the queen seating herself by him  the most christian king arose to receive the sieur  the queen turned to her favorite maid of honor lucetta   this grandee must be irish observed the queen by the great of he carries before his name it is true said lucetta for your majesty may remember most of the brigade officers who are returned to ireland had great of before their names since the laws against papists have been relaxed in ireland several gentlemen who were in foreign services have returned to their native country   i remember it well answered the queen blushing   her majesty laying the back of her right hand convexed into the palm of her left which she had concaved for the purpose and resting her elbows upon her hips with great ease dropped both hands upon  the queens hands fell just over that spot where in the picture of venus the golden clasp unites the argent zone of the goddess  the queen courtesying to the ground with the most amiable humility while her eyes darted beams more penetrating than the rays of apollo  her hands still keeping their position  said to the sieur oriely  noble sir your are welcome to these parts   the whole court was astonished at her majestys condescension   the sieur oriely was overwhelmed with her goodness even to confusion   bowing to the ground with profound respect and drawing back his right leg he thurst his spur into that part of the gentlemanushers ancle where the articulation unites the leg to the foot  the electrified gentleman usher sprung from the ground with a sacra dieu and forgetting the presence he was in laid his hand upon his sword the sieur oriely turning round his head looked the gentleman usher full in the face and curling up his mustachios over his nostrils muttered something in a language neither english irish french nor spanish  it partook of each language  he grinned horribly a ghastly smile  the gentleman usher felt the full force of the gorgon grin he stood petrified  the whole court laughed  the sieur oriely took a pinch of snuff  he took it from his coatpocket where he always kept it loose  the sieur oriely falling upon his left knee rivetted his eyes upon the eyes of the queen of france  i have got it here said oriely thursting his hand into his breeches pockets  i have got that here to present to your majesty the like of which was never seen in france in spain nor in any other country on the continent  the queen of france lucetta her favorite the maids of honor and all the other ladies of the court smiled while their eyes followed the hand of the sieur into his breechespocket  a thousand ideas struck their imagination   i have it here exclaimed the sieur with an exulting voice as he drew from his breeches pocket a long roll  it was a roll of parchment on which was written a list of the english merchantmen taken by the fleets of france and spain  the sieur oriely was right  france nor spain nor no country in the universe ever before saw such a sight  the french king had read about one quarter of the list when a nobleman rushed in out of breath  eagerness and astonishment were in his countenance  the belle poule said the nobleman is taken  england must become bankrupt exclaimed the french king  the captain officers and one half of the seamen said the nobleman are killed  lord have mercy on their souls ejaculated the french king  but we have taken the english convoy  amen added a bishop nodding half a sleep in a chair  we have taken the english convoy  let masses be said for the killed said the queen  we have taken the english convoy  not till thanksgiving is sung for the victory said monsieur sartine  we have taken the english convoy   the belle poule the captain the officers and the seamen were immediately forgotten by the court of france  they had taken the english convoy  the french king had read through half the list when another nobleman came in  the duke dartois is gone said the nobleman with a melancholy voice  then we have lost the patron of fashion said the gentlemenusher looking down upon his enormous buckles with a sigh  you must conceal the dukes death said the french king till the rejoicings are over  we have taken the english convoy  if half the princes of the blood were dead i would not mourn nor wear mourning this month  for we have taken the english convoy   vive le roi exclaimed the nobleman but alas letting his voice fall into a sorrowful piano it is the artois ship of war carrying sixtyfour guns and seven hundred men that is gone  good heaven said the queen the artois was commanded by an irishman and was taken by an irishman ant please your majesty answered the nobleman the artois was commanded by the count dclonard and taken by captain mac bride  when greek meets greek then comes the tug of war said oriely  these irishmen lucetta whispered the queen of france are always standing in our way  that is our own fault ant please your majesty answered lucetta  was their force equal interrogated the french king  pretty equal answered the nobleman  by no means said oriely turning to an irish officer who stood behind him  clonard fought against his king and country  disloyalty weighed him down and the reproach of being a parracide weakened his heart  merciful heaven that zeal should so long have blinded england and my native land persecution was consumed in a fire of her own kindling in the month of june    0  l  g  g  r  n as to force her subjects to fight against her  big tears stood in the eye of the sieur oriely for an instant  they rolled down the surrows of his sunburned cheek  he took his handkerchief from the hilt of his sword to wipe those tears away which his countryman perceiving he clasped the veteran in his arms and received the tears upon his faithful bosom   here ended the letter from paris  maria had dropped a sympathetic tear with oriely  miss verjuice had swelled but the fountain of humanity was dried within  not a tear fell  you have taken no small pains captain said miss verjuice to blazon the virtue and courage of your own countrymen attend to the next letter said the captain and you shall acknowledge i have not been partial  so saying the captain put another paper in my hand and i read   oriely and sartine the court having broken up monsieur sartine conducted the sieur oriely from the royal palace to his own house   dinner being ended and the attendants ordered to retire sartine filled a rummer glass with burgundy and taking the sieur by the hand  you islanders said sartine drink deep  come you must fill to my toast  i am going to give the land we live in  the sieur seizing the decanter in his right hand and a rummer glass in his left turned up his eyes to heaven with a look of ardent zeal approaching devotion  he heaved a heavy sigh from the bottom of his deep chest expressive of his feeling and pouring the libation of burgundy into his rummer till it overflowed the brim and rising from his chair his eye still turned up to heaven he articulated in an expression of grief mingled with pleasure  the british dominions   sartine smiled at what he supposed a mistake of his guest   you are an irishman said sartine and have privilege to fall into errors without giving offense  i excuse you my friend but i meant by my toast the dominions of the grand monarque  then answered oriely you should have said  the land we breathe in  there is no living any where but under a free government  i have considered myself as dying of a consumption ever since i left my native climate so here she goes and pouring more wine upon the liquor which already overflowed his rummer  here she goes repeated oriely with an oath   it is a bumper toast said sartine and should have preceded all others filling at the same time the rummer he had emptied to the dominions of the grand monarque  it is a bumper toast by heaven said oriely and the world must give way to her  only half of the world said sartine  she is the mother of the islands continued oriely  she is the sovereign mistress of the sea  i love her as i love the blood of my heart  my toast is old england   monsieur sartine was struck dumb  he sipped part of his burgundy   this victory of ours said sartine recovering from his surprise as oriely recovered from his agitation this victory of ours is glorious what victory enquired his guest have we not taken the english convoy said sartine  we may say with caesar veni vidi vici yes you may say that said oriely you came you saw you conquered but i cannot see much honor in the affair nor much courage nor any great national advantage  the devil a sword was drawn  nor the devil a gun was fired and when the cargoes are divided between france and spain where will be the advantage   let me tell you monsieur sartine this glorious victory gained without fighting or bloodshed will cost france and spain more ships more men more money and more reputation than a thousand times the value of the ships they have taken   englishmen are as delicate of the character of their courage as english women are of the reputation of their chastity   take my word for it monsieur sartine a short time will show you same of those laconic english gazetteepistles that say the enemies ships are all taken sunk burned and destroyed as per margin   the times are altered said sartine  i grant such accounts have formerly appeared but in our late engagements with the english we have fought like devils incarnate  you have done wonders no doubt answered the hibernian but if your men have fought like devils how must these men have fought who cut your devils to pieces  they must have fought like angels at least  the courage of the english is natural it is inherent to the soil  their dogs their horses their game cocks are constitutionally brave send them to france and they degenerate  it is the same with their men it is true indeed and pity it is it is true that what with taking the grand tour and being upon terms of familiarity at home with the base outcasts of foreign nations the dancing fiddling skipping tribe of the operahouse many of our young fellows of fashion have sunk from their natural spirit and the dignity of manhood  ed  d o  s  w   monsieur sartine pulled out his watch  it is time said sartine we should attend the drawing room  he ordered his carriage and taking oriely with him drove for the palace   oriely at the drawing room the rump of beef when oriely arrived at the drawing room he was joined by his countryman in the french service  description is inadequate said orielys countryman the tongue of man cannot communicate a proper idea of the vanity the pride the presumption of this volatile nation  from the meanest peasant up to the grand monarque they are jigging it over the whole country   the court is in an uproar  all the foreign ministers all the nobles and all the wives sons and daughters of the nobles and foreign ministers have been invited to partake of the english and irish beef taken on board the quebec fleet  a large rump has been sent to paris as a specimen this rump was intended for the kings table but not a pot in his majestys kitchen was large enough to boil it  the chief cook has made his fortune by showing it at a dernier per head there never was such a rump seen in france   the magnitude of this rump had set all the court ladies of france calculating  they thought of nothing but the rump  the rump was still uppermost in their thoughts and at their tongues ends  the queen of france intending to enquire after the kings health enquired after his majestys rump  lucetta missed her little lapdog  has any one seen it said lucetta there never was so pretty a thing  seen what asked monsieur sartine my little rump answered lucetta  a be stung one of the maids of honor on the cheek  i am stung  i am stung  roared the maid of honor  where  where enquired the kings physician  here here here on my rump said the maid of honor  then i cannot extract the sting in this place replied the physician   the magnitude of this rump had set all the court ladies of france calculating  the height of the great statue of jupiter was calculated from his thumb as bearing a proportion to its other parts the stature of the antideluvian giants was calculated from their hipbones found in sicily and the size of the deer formerly in ireland has been calculated from the dimensions of their horns found in the bogs  the french ladies had better materials for calculating than a thumb a hipbone or a deers antler  they calculated from the rump   an english ox said lucetta has i suppose a rump as large again as an englishman  and so by a simple rule of division she measured the limbs of the english prisoners expected at paris  lucetta first measured their rumps in her imagination and thereby hangs a tail  lucetta whispered in the queens ear when she had formed her calulation  you are right said the queen to lucetta that must be the length for that is just half the length of an english oxes horn  we have no such horns in france said lucetta  true but many english gentlemen have french horns answered the queen count dguines when ambassador from france to england introduced french horns into several noble families  c   but i wish the english prisoners were in paris  heavens what horning and butting would be then   now the english rump of beef was such a curiosity in paris that the french king had it modelled in cork  i will try how it fits said the queen of france to lucetta  lucetta fixed the corkrump upon the queen  the queen would never part with it so lucetta and all the ladies of the french court got corkrumps in compliment to her majesty   a drawing room conversation never was drawing room in paris so crowded as this drawing room  all orders of people were admitted tag rag and bobtail poured in and as they poured in they poured out their congratulations to the french king on capturing the quebec fleet  vive le roi was the general cry   there was not half so much rejoicing in england last war when not only quebec itself but all canada was taken from france by the british arms   i always give my opinion openly when it is demanded said the sieur oriely bowing respectfully and answering the king  i was born in a land of liberty and sucked in freedom with the first respirations of life your majesty commands my opinion you shall have an honest one   the english have lost their quebec fleet a heavy loss to them no doubt but no acquisition of glory to france or to spain they had no convoy to fight for them  not a gun fired  not a sword drawn   should the grand fleets of each nation meet then there will be fighting worth speaking of these english are a people who will march up as cool to the mouth of a charged canon as they march up to their bed   to their bed said lucetta to herself  march up coolly to their bed  the sieur must be speaking of batchelors i suppose whispered lucetta to the queen  heaven preserve me from a husband who would march coolly to bed   how did they behave against caesar against the danes  how at cressy  at  at poictiers  at agincourt continued the sieur oriely   they fought at agincourt without their breeches said a merry bishop as he rubbed down his sleek and rubied dewlap at the battle of agincourt the english were so ill with a violent dysentery they were obliged to fight uncovered in the rear    mercy preserve us  ejaculated the queen   it must have been a strange sight said lucetta   and i swear by my bishopric continued the reverend father  and there is not a better bishopric in france had but one company of amazons been in the pay of france that day the unbreeched english would never have carried a standard from the field   it was a dirty affair said the king  to france said oriely  but why did you not open the nunneries the nuns would have done the business as effectually as the amazons confinement gives ferocity to passion  the nuns would have played the devil in the ranks  there would have been no standing before them for five minutes  what says your reverence  you are mistaken replied the bishop the holy mother church takes special care that all women under tuition of its members shall be properly disciplined though nunneries are hotbeds yet the nuns who may be said to vegetate in these beds are cool as cucumbers   as i am a christian ruminated lucetta to herself  had i known that nuns led such chaste and holy lives  i should have taken the veil long since  i should have flourished in one of these hotbeds like a sensitive plant   the sieur oriely went on   let us continued the sieur look to more modern times the astonishing victories of marlborough which exceed any victories antiquity can boast  to these succeed dettingen  minden  hold said monsieur sartine interrupting the sieur you have forgotten or slipped over fountenoy where the english run   not so by heaven said oriely stretching forth his hand and rolling an enthusiastic eye i have not forgotten fountenoy  nor the famous battle of the spurs where the french cavalry galloped off in whole squadrons  the english run at fountenoy yes they run up to the muzzles of your muskets while you were entrenched chindeep in earth and mowing down whole columns from your masked batteries  but notwithstanding the whole power of france your gen darms and your select infantry the english would never have stopped running till they had run into your trenches and forced you to run out but for your auxiliaries  they never stood till the irish brigades appeared before them and then they stood shocked to see the subjects of their own climate the children of their own constitution standing armed to oppose them in the field  the brigades changed the face of the battle they fought for a point of honor and would not flinch the english had the same point of honor to maintain and each fought without losing an inch of ground till the slaughter on both sides made it necessary for each side to retreat  the french looking on   after this good monsieur sartine continued oriely will you pretend to say that at fountenoy even england retreated before france   monsieur sartine stood dumb   this too was the day when the late glorious immortal cumberland rebellions curse and freedoms friend exclaimed against the wretched policy of his country which forced so many of her subjects to fight against her for the wretched pay and precarious sustenance of france   o may the hero ever live the blessing and the honor of his country   the whole court laughed at the sieur orileys blunder  they took it for an error of his head whereas it was an overflowing of his heart  he was grateful to cumberland for his opinion when the duke of cumberland saw the stand made by the irish brigades he cursed with great bitterness the policy which had forced them into a foreign service there was a regiment of irish horse in the service of england that day commanded by lord ligonier which stood till almost cut to pieces   the bishop took him up upon it  the duke of cumberland said the bishop has been dead some years  we have not heard of his resurrection   oriely gave a heavy sigh and with a smile of ineffable contempt retorted upon the holy father  not one of all the saints said oriley that ever monkish superstition canonized in your rubric lives in such glory as the hero  cumberland the brave the generous and good lives in the hearts of a free people and will live in their hearts till memory is no more  and history is obliterated  which of the commanders of your army of martyrs can you say so much   the french king mortified at the spirit and manner in which the brave old hibernian had delivered his sentiments left the drawing room in disgust  the bishop followed his majesty gnawing his under lip he felt for the army of martyrs  and monsieur sartine skipped after with remarkable agility monsieur sartine felt for himself   the queen remained behind which oriely perceiving stepped in between her majesty and the gentleman usher who instantly stepped aside and offering his hand with an obsequious bow her majesty accepted it with an ineffable smile of good humor and condescension  every courtiers heart grew black with envy   lucetta and the maids of honor brought up the rear with their eyes fixed upon orielys back he is at least half the size of an ox said lucetta  what a rump said the maids of honor  and what a ramillietail said lucetta  the maids of honor repeated the observation it flew into the antichamber where it was echoed by the court ladies  the other attendants reechoed it in the upper stories  it got down stairs and returned up stairs verberated and reverberated from room to room from the garret to the coalhole  having finished the sieur orielys interview with their french majestys and returned the paper to the captain miss verjuice opened her mouth a mouth which never opened but like pandorasbox it emitted a collection of evils  happily for the captain in the very instant she was going to give a full discharge of acrimonious sarcasm the servant brought in a note which she informed us required her immediate attendance on a neighboring lady who was seized with labor   miss verjuice though a virgin had the experience of an acoucheur she had read anatomy and was often called in to assist being remarkable for her philosophical conduct which enabled her to stand unmoved when even the midwife has been found so weakhearted as to leave her patient to nature  but if miss verjuice did not possess humanity she possessed the affectation of humanity in the fullest extent for as her virtue consisted in her severity upon the vicious so her humanity consisted in a severe abuse upon the uncharitable  she was a theorist in both but had never entered into the practice of either  not but miss verjuice had passions  but she had never been led into temptation   miss verjuice was punctual to every call of every sick or unfortunate acquaintance who stood in need of no pecuniary assistance no lady could mourn with a more deplorable countenance or sought the house of sorrow with more sedulity than miss verjuice if verbal consolation only was required  yet such was the tenderness of her feelings that if want attended sickness or misfortune she could not bear to look upon accumulated distress and therefore the poor mans door she was never known to enter   punctual in attending church and regular in paying the poorrates it might be said that she was religious and bountiful according to law she practiced all the externals of morality without morals and performed the rituals of devotions without piety i have been particular in describing this virgin and her attributes as she will hereafter cut a very conspicuous figure in these excursions it is true my intention is to show human nature in its amiable light but to do this with any degree of perfection i must be allowed a dark ground and strong shades  many will doubt that such a character exists but let them go to  no let them live in doubt still and may they never receive conviction from experience  the author   miss verjuice notwithstanding an affectation of hurry entered into a dissertation upon the necessity of assisting our fellow creature in distress but maria observing that perhaps her friend might be impatient to see her  she made an apology i returned to the parlour with maria attended by the captain and soon after saw miss verjuice sally forth equipt in her nightdress   the captain proposed a walk to which proposal maria and i acquiescing we proceeded to the bank of the thames and finding a convenient spot close to a thicket sat down to enjoy the beauty of the prospect and the eveningair which being gently agitated by a cooling fragrant breeze pleased and revived the senses   the birds nest a thrush sat perched upon the spray of an old thorn he kept turning and looking to every quarter with evident anxious expectation but being soon joined by his mate who bore food in her mouth his joy became conspicuous as his anxiety had been and he expressed it to his companion in a thousand endearing salutations and offices of love  the hen popped into the thicket to feed her young while the cock turning up his head toward heaven in grateful thanks to his creator for the providential sustenance of his little family poured forth the joyful thanks of his heart in melodious song   but happiness is not the lot of mortal beings from the most insignificant insect up to the great lord of the creation man every animal has its misfortunes  its miseries  all are the sports of contingencies   two boys stole along the thicket  the poor thrush upon the spray instantly stopped his melody  he boys had discovered his nest and before i could prevent the depredation for i arose for the purpose had torn it from the thicket with its infant inhabitants the hen had escaped and joined the mate  the boys carried off their prey the old birds calling in notes of distress  the boys disappeared hope disappeared with them  the unhappy parents sat silent close to each other for a few minutes when as if urged by a mutual despair they took wing together and flew from the scene of their wretchedness   there is something said the captain truly distressing in the exhibition of domestic woe just presented to us  and should i detect a son of mine in the commission of such a robbery as the two little rascals have committed i would punish them as severely as for robbing the church   why in truth said maria it is a species of sacrilege  children should be taught to abhor it to impress the precepts of humanity upon the minds of infants is the first the most essential duty of parents  it prepares the heart for all the tender offices of life and opens the soul to receive the lights of morality and religion   i must pay this tribute to your sentiment said the captain seizing marias hand  pressing it to his breast  he raised it to his lips and kissed it  but with such chastity of devotion as the professed religious kiss the shrines of their patron saints  a tear had fallen from his eye upon marias hand she would have wiped it away with her handkerchief but while viewing it with admiration her heart bleeding with sympathy a beam darted from the eveningsun and exhaled the tear to the upper heaven where it is now preserved upon the altar of grace an evidence of human benignity  it is our duty said the captain to use all animals with mercy  they have life they have sense they have gratitude  those of a domestic nature are most of them endowed with affection and tenderness to their protectors while others possess properties which make us the most beneficial returns  we owe justice to men but grace and goodness to brutes   but said i adverting to the plunder of the poor thrush there is a happiness peculiar to subordinate animals of every species their parental tenderness is but temporary and their grief on losing their offspring though it may be severe while it lasts lasts but a short time whereas with the human species such misfortunes produce permanent grief  often terminate in death   slave trade merciful heaven exclaimed the captain  when we reflect upon the plunder of the human species carried on by nations calling themselves christian professing the divine maxim do as you would be done by boasting the benign principles of humanity and enlightened by the sublime rays of holy revelation it sinks us in my opinion infinitely below the most ferocious beasts of prey for none of these live by the slaughter and calamities of their own kind   i perceive said i you are execrating the conduct of europeans to the unhappy children of africa  i have often reflected upon our cruelty to those people first in carrying them from their native country and then exercising upon them every cruelty that can debase human nature or render life miserable   there is but one way of accounting for this cruelty said maria and stern has hit upon it the poor negroes have no one to stand up for them   they are sacrifices to commerce said i   you mean to avarice said the captain  commerce is a mild deity and never requires human victims to bleed upon her altar   the fruits of industry and the fruits of the earth are her offerings commerce is a cure for the most destructive prejudices where we find agreeable manners there commerce flourishes and wherever there is commerce there we meet agreeable manners  so says montesquieu   commercical laws said i arguing from the same author improve manners but they improve manners from the same reason they destroy them  they corrupt the purest morals polish and refine the most barbarous the spirit of trade produces in the mind of man a certain sense of exact justice but does it not produce sanguinary laws and rage of avarice that overleaps all bound of justice and tramples upon humanity the total deprivation of trade produces robbery  but is not hospitality most rare in trading countries and is it not found in perfection among nations of vagabonds among the ancient germans to shut a door against a stranger would be considered as sacrilege   i shall not take upon me said maria to determine how far such nations may merit the opprobrious term you have given them but i should rather live and die among such a people than among the most refined and i think this hospitality which must necessarily include in it an assiduity to please is a convincing proof of the excellency of the human heart in a simple state  what have we got by our boasted improvements and frivilous politeness but the loss of manly firmness and independence i could write a very long note upon this  ed o  s  w    the captain looked at maria with astonishment and seizing her hand with a degree of rapture exclaimed you are right  you are right my girl avarice sensuality and every species of meanness have succeeded to generosity and honor and faction and servitude with bellowing on one side and adulation on the other are storming and undermining the asylum of liberty  almost every man wears the mask of hypocrisy  the noble frankness which marked the character of englishmen has dwindled into an affectation of sentiment and in assuming susceptibility of too refined feelings from feeling like men we have adopted the manners of women  even philosophy participates the refinement of modern manners she forgets her chaste and simple character  she forgets that she once inhabited the lonely cot of socrates and shared the frugal fare of epaminondas  then your legislators and generals  show me a modern senator or commander who will descend from the seat of magistracy or car of triumph and cultivate the land which his voice enacted laws to rule or which he defended with his blood   but to advert to the subject we were on continued the captain every man who possesses humanity can vindicate the rights of humanity in his own breast but few men who feel the force of these rights have ability to defend them  when a benevolent mind contemplates the ravages with which avarice has depopulated whole regions of the earth the soul shudders with horror  but when we see the unhappy negro seduced by the wiles of european dissimulation or dragged by treachery and force from his native liberty relations friends  perhaps the partner of his heart and pledges of his love  then indeed the soul revolts and execrates the villain and the infamous policy which protects the villain who to indulge his avarice by providing for the sensuality of others tramples upon natural rights and forces into the vile regions of servitude men born free as himself it is really astonishing that in the dependencies of great britain slavery should be permitted the court of kings bench in the celebrated negro cause laid it down as a principle of the english constitution that slavery could not exist in this country and that the instant a negro set his foot on shore he was free surely the principles of the constitution are immutable and rule in all the dependencies of great britain though the local laws do not and therefore slavery cannot constitutionally exist in the dependencies  f  h  r  ve   i have served in south america continued the captain  i have conversed with the slaves and have sound among them men as capable of generous sentiment and of as noble soul as ever distinguished the character of a white  good heavens my heart sinks when recollection presents to my imagination the misery of these unfortunate fellow creatures to whom death alone can give enfranchisement   here the captain stopped  he was too full to proceed   as we are convinced said maria from our own feelings that our hearts naturally incline us to relieve misery and our reason approves it as right  when we consider that providence has infused humanity into our breasts and has taught us to look to him as an example of mercy it is astonishing that pity and the divine pleasure which results from doing good should be so far exterminated from mankind  cruelties said the captain which no tongue can describe which no heart can conceive but from the evidence of the eyes are inflicted upon negroes the american and westindian newspapers may give a slight idea of the deplorable situation of these unhappy creatures in these papers they are advertised as negro fellows or negro wenches  often described as bearing their tyrannic masters brand upon their cheek  having a padlocked yoke about their neck or carrying the marks of merciless stripes upon their skin  i have seen them roused by the lash to their labor  drove into stalls in herds like brutes and fed worse than those dogs which are kept for the purpose of hunting them when they attempt to escape  then in their old age they are turned out to poverty  and they are denied baptism from an apprehension it would make them insolen   pray said maria addressing the captain are there any clergymen in those countries   every parish has its pastor answered the captain and every pastor is a planter and keeps unbaptized slaves   lord have mercy upon their souls said maria   on whose souls asked the captain   on the souls of those planters answered maria   do you mean said the captain the planters of christianity if you do    this blot seems to be the very reverse of the blot which the recording angel dropped upon my uncle tobys oath  laurence stern  and indeed the planters of tobacco do not appear in a much better predicament   the captain would have proceeded but perceiving maria was in tears he immediately stopped he would have added no doubt that at the death of a planter the negroes are sold by auction fathers separated from their children and their wives  that a white man may beat a black man with impunity or debauch his wife or daughter  that he may murder him upon paying his value and that it is death for a black to strike a white  and so it should be  a planter  he had a soul brave as achilles  had a heart melting as infant tenderness   we will change the conversation said the captain  here my lad said he handing a paper here is the account i published of count odunn  i took the paper and read   count odunns negotiation with the queen of portugal count odunns appointment if her majesty of portugal could be prevailed upon to join the armed neutrality said the grand monarque england must submit  her flag would no longer proudly fly with usurped authority upon the narrow seas  the thunder of her cannon would no longer with sovereign arrogance command the ships of other independent states to lower their topsails  what is to be done sartine   nothing can be done answered monsieur sartine our most able and subtle negotiators have failed in their negotiations with the queen of portugal   count odunn who had been employed last war as plenipotentiary to the court of lisbon was standing at the french kings elbow  our most able and subtle negotiators have failed repeated monsieur sartine   they were frenchmen said count odunn to himself   the queen of portugal is as impenetrable as flint said monsieur sartine   to french negotiators said count odunn to himself   you have been in portugal odunn said the french king  with a wink which implied you have seen pharsalia but mum  what think you of the queen is she that soul of marble sartine represents her  is there no getting at her heart  she is a woman may it please your majesty answered odunn and i know but of one way by which her heart can be approached   the count has been a man of gallantry in his time observed the french queen  no man at court has the character of getting nearer a ladys heart than the count   three ladies sighed in confirmation of what her majesty said   then he is the very man to do business with the queen of portugal said monsieur sartine  the count odunn was immediately invested with full powers to negotiate with the queen of portugal  the count depended but little however upon his paper instructions though an old man his chief dependence was upon his abilities  then he had experience and experience is half the battle  he knew it was a lady he had to deal with and no man breathing knew better how to deal with a lady   odunns arrival at lisbon soon as the count odunn arrived at lisbon he dispatched his secretary to court  the lady in waiting informed the queen of portugal  the count was desired to attend in the antichamber  he was announced  he appeared and the instant he appeared every woman in the room ejaculated the first letter of his name with a note of admiration annexed  o o o o o went round the room  o was the only sound for two minutes   the ladies of the court dissected count odunn as ladies of the court always dissect strangers on their first appearance  one praised his legs another praised his shoulders  a third praised his eyes  but the old duchess of b  was actually smitten with him on account of his forefinger   as the count had crossed one of the private courtyards unfortunate for the old duchess of b  he had occasion to draw  off his glove  the old duchess of b  was at that instant peeping at the count through a lattice with her magnifying glass and the forefinger of the count hit exactly upon her graces focus  her grace could not avoid gazing on the counts forefinger   the count wore two brilliants on his forefinger  they were family jewels the counts father had given them to his mother his mother had given them to him  they rivetted the eyes of the old duchess of b  with as fascinating a power as if she had gazed upon a rattlesnake   the old duchess was experienced in the value of brilliants and the instant she perceived those on the counts forefinger her grace exclaimed never did i see such a finger never did i see such brilliants  they are only fit for a queen   the duchess of b  was avaricious therefore the instant the idea of the queen came across her grace she concluded that if these brilliants which garnished count odunns forefinger could be procured for her majesty of portugal  her own fortune was made   little did the duchess of b  think that by this determination she would serve not only the queen of portugal but the armed neutrality of europe  some say that the count having perceived the old duchess of b  speculating through the lattice and knowing her to be in the queens confidence he drew off his glove on purpose but whether he did or did not whether the action was accidental or maneuver it is certain that the count odunn got into the queens confidence by it   when the old duchess of b  informed the queen of portugal of what she had seen her portuguese majesty smiled  you must be mistaken my dear duchess said the queen i never heard of so white so taper a forefinger nor of such brilliants as you have described  if they are so large they must be equal in value to the famous diamond worn by the great mogul and exceed that in the hat of the french king  you have been deceived by a false appearance  consider my dear dear duchess you were looking through a magnifying glass   the queen was right and the queen was wrong  the duchess of b  was right  and the duchess of b  was wrong  the old duchess was deceived not in the magnitude but in the quality of what she supposed to be brilliants  they were nothing better than common irish diamonds which are plenty in london and paris   in lisbon they had novelty to recommend them   we must keep up decorum said the queen of portugal to the duchess of b  before we admit count odunn to our presence you must enquire into the nature of his business  the old duchess flew to the antichamber and put the question to the count she found him incircled by the ladies of the court  my business said count odunn is with the queen herself  and to the queen herself alone will i impart my business   then you will not trust me said the old duchess   by heaven i will not trust you my lady duchess nor any other lady in the court  the court ladies hung down their heads   i am keeper of the queens secrets  said the old duchess of b   but you are not keeper of my secrets answered count odunn  the old duchess fixing her eye upon the counts forefinger took him by the hand and led him to the queens apartment   the hemsignal the duchess had much at stake she had drawn a picture for the queen and she knew the consequence if the original should fall short of the copy she had some doubts from what the queen had started that her magnifying glass might have deceived her i was once very much deceived in a scene of my own writing which depended upon the doctrine of proportions the figure of an hercules clothed was to have been exhibited in my comedy of the world as it goes alias second thoughts are best but the villainous propertyman had the fellow who represented the demigod put upon the pedestal as naked i intended the figure should have been fully proportioned in all its parts whereas a narrowshouldered man was chosen  so that when the femalevirtuoso who was to have been rendered ridiculous by applying disproportions to a proportioned figure came to give her judgment the satire was lost the fellow who played the statue being actually in appearance too narrow in the thorax to hold the vital parts and horridly disproportioned in the foreshortening of one of his members  mc  w  y  her fears however subsided upon her interview with the count she viewed him without her glass and joy flushed her cheeks she measured him with her eyes as a female virtuoso measures the beautiful representations of nature in the galleries of italy   the duchess of b  had been a woman of remarkable sensibility sympathy was her weakness in her youth she had found the highest satisfaction in communicating pleasure to others and her greatest pleasure now was in procuring it yet no woman had ever given more pain than the duchess of b  but then no woman had ever gone further than the duchess of b  to alleviate the pain she had given man never kneeled to her grace in vain nor petitioned her grace without relief an old lady of my acquaintance is just such another merciful character  h  rr  n dowg   the duchess of b  having approached the door of the royal closet gave a loud hem  this hem informed the queen of portugal that count odunn was near   her majesty of portugal was at that instant standing before a great glass wrapped up in admiration of herself all portugal admired the queen of portugal but no subject in portugal admired the queen of portugal more than the queen of portugal admired herself   yet the queen was not vain  she knew the power of her charms from their effects upon mankind and the subject of her consideration now was to muster and draw out in amorous array their full force armed at all points against count odunn   but the whole system of the queen of portugals intended operations against the count was overturned by the hemsignal of the duchess of b  every glance every leer every smile every giggle which art had armed for her assistance and long experience had exercised into discipline fled at the instant the hemsignal was given nor could the queen with all her generalship rally them into order  nature had taken possession of their post and defied the powers of art to dislodge her  the interview the queen of portugal as many able commanders have done threw herself upon chance  she sat upon a sopha  the door of the closet opened  the eyes of the queen shut   the complexion of the queen of portugal was a bright olive  count odunn never considered colors  he admired the whole sex  every color had its attraction for him  he loved woman because she was woman and to this generous affection he bore to woman kind may be imputed a passion the most generous and disinterested which from his youth he had entertained for an individual  the count made his obeisance  the queen opened her eyes  the count dropped the curtains of his eyes  a dead silence ensued   the duchess of b  broke silence  she introduced the count in form as plenipotentiary from the court of france and recollecting his declaration in refusing to communicate his business to any person but the queen in private she retired as a woman of discretion should  shut the door  fell upon her knees  and applied her eye close to the keyhole   had count odunn been before all the male crowned heads in europe he would not have evinced diffidence  had count odunn been marching up against a battery he would not have betrayed fear  yet the count was silent and trembled before the queen of portugal  pray captain said maria perceiving i rested at the conclusion of the last sentence what made count odunn tremble  if you do not know madam you must ask the naturalists  answered the captain  maria had a quick conception  she found it dangerous to require a more minute explanation  so requested i would proceed   odunns negotiation her majesty of portugal began the negotiation whereas it was the duty of the count to have began  but in truth he had forgot the interest of the neutral powers  there was nothing neutral about him   your prudence sir said the queen in not communicating your business to any of my ministers proves you worthy of your employment  the business of politics should never be carried on through a medium   it is quite contrary in affairs of love please your majesty answered the count   you are certainly right replied the queen giving up all thoughts of politics a medium in love is to be preferred  and the man who would reach a womans heart must first discover the proper medium  the cool lover is despicable  an overwarm passion is seldom lasting  but i should wish to hear your opinion upon the subject   it is too difficult a subject for me said the count i have attempted to discuss it a thousand and a thousand times but could never reach the end  love is a subject which defies the power of logic of philosophy of mathematics  i have tried love every way said count odunn and i have been told that those who have tried it scientifically and systematically have found themselves little better than fools upon the subject   i knew a fool said the old duchess of b  taking her eye from the keyhole  who could handle the subject better than the wisest of them all   bless me exclaimed the queen throwing her eye upon the counts forefinger how remiss have i been in keeping you standing so long   it is my duty answered the count to stand in your majestys presence   but as you are the representative of a king replied the queen i insist upon your sitting   the count being seated upon a sopha with the queen proceeded upon the business of the neutral powers  he presented his credentials  the queen of portugal examined them  she spoke of her obligations to england  the count withdrew his credentials from her hand  the queen drew them back  examined them again  the count pushed the point closer  still the queen objected but faintly the count maintained his point   your majesty may perceive said the count turning up his credentials toward the queen so as to show the two brilliants the duchess of b  had mentioned your majesty may perceive said he it is a plain proposition   the queen of portugal answered   the count odunn replied   the queen of portugal rebutted   the count odunn surrebutted  i submit said the queen  you have prevailed  i give england  i give up every thing  i give up the world to your argument count o   before the queen could fully pronounce the counts name odunn had put the pen in her hand and her majesty subscribed to the neutral confederacy   oh ejaculated the queen of portugal   ah ejaculated the old duchess of b  and she fell upon the floor  such is the power of sympathy it flew through the keyhole and hit the old duchess full on the brain   france has carried the day said the old duchess of b  opening the door and entering the room   upon my soul but you are out now answered count odunn as he put up his credentials  it was ireland that carried the day  so making a bow he retired to dispatch a courier to paris   now the duchess of b  having written an account of odunns negotiation with the queen of portugal to madam dc  lady of the french queens bedchamber the french queen insisted that the french king should recall count odunn from an apprehension that he might be assassinated   un petit souper the eveningdew beginning to fall heavy maria proposed returning home when we arrived at the town the captain took his leave having previously insisted that i should accompany him the next morning at six to see a royal chase  maria as we walked toward her lodgings corroborated my suspicion that the captain was a dying swain to virgin verjuice and assured me of much entertainment from the history of his amors the captain having for a series of years been a constant dangler after rich old maids and endowed widows of various descriptions   we found the cloth laid and supper was served in almost immediately after we entered the parlour  two plates upon the table informed me that my company was expected and having no inclination to retreat suddenly i sat down to table with as easy familiarity as if i had been one of the family  i saw maria was pleased at the frankness of my conduct  and what can be more pleasing than an unceremonious cheerful acquiescence in partaking of the hospitable preparations of a friend  the supper would have lost half its relish by a formal invitation   you must help yourself said maria laying the wing of a duck upon her plate i followed her example   here is wine said maria   a dumbwaiter which stood at my righthand answered all the purposes of ostentatious attendance  we sat in the full enjoyment of liberty and social festivity  eat talked and laughed without restraint   i must fill to the brim said i taking up a decanter of madeira  maria smiled consent  it is to the continuance of our love my dear maria  maria blushed  she hung her head but as she hung her head she turned up her eye   let it overflow said maria and she sighed  let it overflow  i will pledge you with all my soul   and i am all impatience added i  my heart is thirsty for the toast   we sipped from our brimmers  touched glasses and changed glasses  i tasted the nectar of marias lip upon her glass  the touch had raised the sparkle of the wine and the wine had given her eyes additional luster  their power was irresistible  i must quench this flame thought i as i swallowed my wine  but wine is oil to the lamp of love  the flame from my heart increased   i got close to marias side and pressed her hand  we drank again touched glasses and touched cheeks  i had thrown my arm negligently across the back of her chair  my head reclined upon her bosom  maria rung a bell that lay upon the table the servant appeared she ordered him to remove the suppertable   an illustration or the extinguisher do you know said maria sighing as the servant left the room that i have been thinking continually upon the cruelties which the captain told us were inflicted upon the poor negroes by their merciless taskmasters  he says there are noble souls among these people   shakespeare was of the same opinion said i when he drew the character of othello   your speaking of othello said maria reminds me of a passage in the play which i could never understand  i mean that line where othello says  put out the light and then put out the light  i could never receive any satisfaction from the commentators  there lay upon a couch close to maria a silver chambercandlestick and extinguisher   i will give you an illustration of the passage said i taking up the extinguisher  put out the light  i pressed the extinguisher upon the candles  and then   what say the critics as critic is an animal not well understood permit me to give a description of it  but soft a critics portrait i espy lord what a jaundiced color stains the eye how hard the expression without ease or grace like janus too he wears a double face  f pillon   this description is well it describes your hermaphrodite or doublesexed doubleheaded critic with one face brass the other human  c  w  y and wife    to this illustration we say that in our opinion this is a palpable irish bull which we cannot translate into plain english no more than we could translate the irish debates of the last sessions of the irish parliament for we cannot conceive an illustration in the dark  william w  df  l  we are all of the same opinion  the diurnal critics of the daily papers     what say their wives we say we can conceive an illustration in the dark and though our husbands cannot see such an illustration it is to us clear as the sun  cats eyes are not necessary it is an illustration to the minds eye and therefore if the thing to be illustrated be felt and understood it is sufficient  the wives of critics    finis
