an essay of health and long life  by george cheyne m d f r s   hippoc at imbecillis quo in numero magna pars urbanorum omnesque pene cupidi literarum sunt observatio major necessaria est ut quod vel corporis vel loci vel studii ratio detrahit cura restituat cells london printed for george strahan at the golden ball over against the royal exchange in cornhill and j leake bookseller at bath       to the right honorable sir joseph jekyll master of the rolls this treatise is inscribed as a testimony of respect and gratitude by  his most obliged faithful humble servant george cheyne  the preface this being probably the last time i may trespass on the public i look upon myself in some measure obliged to settle my accounts with the world as an author before i make my exit by endeavoring to show i have not always offended out of presumption vanity or wantonness  the first time i adventured in print was on the account of my great master and generous friend dr pitcairn he thought himself illused by some of his brethren of the profession who then were at intestine war on the subject of fevers and fancied the handsomest way to bring them down was to exhibit a more specious account of this disease than any of them had shown his business then in the practice of physic was so great as not to allow him sufficient time for such a work two others therefore with myself were joined to manage the affair in which he was to cut and carve and to add the practical part my province was the theory i was then very young in the profession and living in the country but in a few days i brought in my part finished as it now appears under the title of the new theory of fevers the others either suppressed or forgot theirs and mine without the least alteration but in a few words was ordered for the press i could not resist the commands of my friend but would not suffer my name to be put to it being conscious it was a raw and unexperienced performance there are though some thing sin it which may be of use to beginners both as to the method of philosophising on the animal economy and in the account of the manner of the operation of the greater medicines the foundations also and the causes assigned for acute and slow fevers i still think solid and just and more particular and limited than those of any other theory yet published but it wants so much filing and finishing so many alterations and additions as would cost me more labor and pains than the writing a new treatise on the same subject so that out of mere laziness and inappetency i have thrown it by as unripe fruit and suffered it to be as if it never had been  my next sally was in a book of abstracted geometry and algebra entitled methodus fluxionum inversa brought forth in ambition and bred up in vanity there are some things in it tolerable for the time when the methods of quadratures the mensuration of ratios and transformation of curves into those of other kinds were not advanced to such heights as they now are but it is a long time since i was forced to forgo these barren and airy studies for more substantial and commodious speculations indulging and rioting in these so exquisitely bewitching contemplations being only proper for public professors and those born to estates and who are under no outward necessities besides to own a great but grievous truth though they may quicken and sharpen the invention strengthen and extend the imagination improve and refine the reasoning faculty and are of use both in the necessary and the luxurious refinement of mechanical arts yet having no tendency to rectify the will sweeten the temper or mend the heart they often leave a stiffness positiveness and sufficiency on weak minds much more pernicious to society and the interests of the great end of our being than all the advantages they bring them can recompense they are indeed edgetools not to be trusted in the hands of any but those who have already acquired an humble heart a lowly spirit and a sober and teachable temper for in others they are very apt to beget a secret and refined pride an overweening and overbearing vanity the most opposite temper to the true gospelspirit which without offense i may suppose to be the best disposition of mind that tempts them to presume on a kind of omniscience in respect of their fellow creatures that have not risen to their elevation and to set up for an infallibility or at least a decisive judgment even in matters which do not admit of a more or less their proper object of which kind whatever relates to the infinite author of our being most certainly is upon all which accounts conscious of my own weakness i have long since bid them an adieu farther than as they serve to amuse or are useful in the absolute necessities of life  the defense of that book against the learned and acute mr abr de moivre being written in a spirit of levity and resentment i most sincerely retract and wish undone so far as it is personal or peevish and ask him and the world pardon for it as i do for the defense of dr pitcairns dissertations and the new theory of fevers against the late learned and ingenious dr oliphant i heartily condemn and detest all personal reflections all malicious and unmannerly turns and all false and unjust representations as unbecoming gentlemen scholars and christians and disprove and undo both performances as far as in me lies in every thing that does not strictly and barely relate to the argument  the first part of the philosophical principles that of natural religion consists merely of discourses and lectures of natural philosophy and of its consequences on religion occasionally read or discoursed to that most noble and great person the duke of roxburgh who is now so great an ornament to his country and his high employments to whom they were inscribed i thought they might be of use to other young gentlemen who while they were learning the elements of natural philosophy might have thereby the principles of natural religion insensibly instilled into them and accordingly it has been and is still used for that purpose at both universities upon which account upon proper occasions i will not fail to improve it in all the new discoveries in experimental philosophy or in the final and natural causes of things as happen to be made so as to leave it as little imperfect in its kind as i possibly can  the second part of the philosophical principles to wit that of revealed religion was added afterward to show that all our knowledge of nature was by analogy or the relations of things only and not their real nature substance or internal principles that from this method of analogy the only medium of humane knowledge we should be necessarily led to conclude the attributes or qualities of the supreme and absolute infinite were indeed analogous to the properties or qualities of finite beings but only in such a manner as the difference between infinite and finite requires and that therefore not being able to know precisely these differences we ought implicitly to believe without reasoning what is revealed to us concerning the nature of the infinite being or bring our reason to submit to the mysteries of faith how i have succeeded is not for me to determine as the end was honest i am secure the great principles and the fundamental propositions are true and just they may want a little farther clearing up and explication but as yet i have met with no reason to retract any thing material else i should most certainly do it  the essay on the gout and bath waters was brought forth by mere accident the first draught being as i there mentioned only a paper of directions for a gentleman my friend and patient troubled with the gout it was enlarged upon different occasions and published to prevent its being pyrated several copies having been given out to others in the same circumstances i have the satisfaction to know from many different hands that it has benefited great numbers of infirm and afflicted persons and shall therefore go on to cultivate it as far as my poor abilities will permit  i am now come to this my last production whose origin was as casual as that of my former my good and worthy friend the present master of the rolls having been last autumn at bath for a confirmation of his health at his departure desired of me to draw up some instructions in writing to direct him in the conduct of his health for the future and in the manner of supporting his spirits free and full under the great business he is engaged in i was then in the hurry of our season and could not so soon answer his expectation as his real worth and my sincere esteem required i thought myself therefore the more obliged as soon as i had leisure to exert myself to the uttermost in obedience to his commands at first i drew up most of these rules at the end of the several chapters but upon reflection thought it not respect enough to his good taste and capacity to judge of the reasons of things to prescribe him bare and dry directions in matters of so great moment i added therefore the philosophical account and reasons of these rules which make up the bulk of the chapters themselves he out of his love to his fellowcitizens which is one shining part of his character and which i ought to suppose has in this instance only imposed on his better judgment desired they might be made public upon which account several things have been since added to make the whole of more general use if therefore any thing in this treatise be tolerable or if any person receive benefit by it they owe it entirely to that excellent person upon whose account solely it was undertaken and at whose request it is published  i have indeed long and often observed with great pity and regret many very learned ingenious and even religious persons who being weak and tender as such generally are have suffered to the last extremity for want of a due regimen of diet and other general directions of health who had good sense enough to understand the force and necessity of such rules valued health sufficiently and despised sensual gratifications for the pleasures of the mind so far as to be able and willing to abstain from every thing hurtful deny themselves any thing their appetites craved and to conform to any rules for a tolerable degree of health ease and freedom of spirits and yet being ignorant how to conduct themselves from what to abstain and what to use they have suffered even to mortal agonies who had they been better directed and instructed had passed their lives in tolerable ease and quiet it is for these and these only the following treatise is designed the robust the luxurious the potcompanions the loose and the abandoned have here no business their time is not yet come but the sickly and the aged the studious and the sedentary persons of weak nerves and the gentlemen of the learned professions i hope by the divine blessing on the following treatise may be enabled to follow their studies and professions with greater security and application and yet preserve their health and freedom of spirits more entire and to a longer date i am morally certain had i known and been as well satisfied of the necessity of the rules here laid down thirty years ago as i am now i had suffered less and had had a greater freedom of spirits than i have enjoyed but every thing is best as it has been except the errors and failings of our free wills  i know no useful means of health and long life i have omitted nor any pernicious custom i have not noted and have given the plainest and most familiar reasons i could urge for the rules i have here laid down most of my arguments as they needs must have risen out of the animal functions and economy and i have used as little subtilty and refinement in my explications of these as the present state of natural philosophy could admit i have been often contented with plain and obvious facts to account for appearances and the cautions thence deduced when according to the humor of the present age i might have run into refined speculations of metaphysics or mathematics being contented with the crasso modo philosophari because we shall never be able to search out the works of the almighty to perfection so as to penetrate the internal nature of things  i have consulted nothing but my own experience and observation on my own crazy carcass and the infirmities of others i have treated in the following rules their reasons and philosophy so that if any thing is borrowed it has occurred to me as my own but in so far as authorities go to shorten philosophical accounts not but that all systematick writers in physic and many particular authors have treated the same subject but their rules besides that they are often inconsistent with reason or contrary to experience are so general and expressed in so unlimited and undefined terms as leave little or no certainty in them when applied to particular cases they want the necessary precision and exactness and so became useless or perplexing and lastly when they come which is rarely to be found among them to give the reasons and philosophy of their directions they have not the perspicuity and natural way of convincing the ingenious sickly and tender sufferers so necessary to make them cheerfully and readily undergo such severe restraints which i take to be by far the most difficult part of such a work and which i have labored with my utmost power to supply  i know not what may be the fate and success of this performance nor am i solicitous about it being conscious the design was honest the subject weighty and the execution the best my time my abilities and my health would permit which cannot bear the labor of much fileing and finishing being careful not to incroach on the province of the physician i have concealed nothing my knowledge could suggest to direct the sufferer in the best manner i could to preserve his health and lengthen out his life and i have held out no false or delusory lights to lead him astray or torment him unnecessarily  if it were possible any set of men could be offended at my performance it might be my brethren of the profession for endeavoring to lessen the materia morbifica but as this would be the most malicious unjust and unworthy reflection could be thrown on scholars and gentlemen of a liberal education so i never entertained the most remote vanity to think any endeavor of mine would make so considerable a change in the nation especially when the devil the world and the flesh were on the other side of the question which have stood their ground even against the rules of life and immortality brought to light by the gospel  i cannot conclude this tedious preface without begging pardon of the reader for troubling him with my private matters all i can say as an apology is that of whatsoever indifference my concerns as an author may be to him yet they were not so to me this being the only place and time i may have to adjust them in and it being the height of my ambition  nil conscire mihi nulla pallescere culpa the contents introduction    it is easier to

affect the passions are divided into spiritual and animal     prop ii wherein the union of the soul and body consists     schol some laws of that union     prop iii in spirits there is an active selfmotive principle ib schol a proof of this principle from the existence of motion     prop iv there is in spirits a principle analogous to attraction     schol the necessity of this principle   0 the remains of it in our fallen state ib corol i the nature of spiritual good and evil     corol ii a division of the passions into pleasurable and painful viz love and hatred and the dependents on them ib   the passions with respect to their effects on the body may be divided into acute and chronical as they produce this or that kind of diseases     the effects of acute passions ib the cause of

physic ib   what spiritual love or charity is     though at first it has the appearance of a common passion yet in its perfection it proves the exercise of a particular faculty in the soul proper to itself p     that all objects being to be loved in proportion to their beauty god must be loved infinitely and all creatures even ourselves in comparison to him not at all       yet there is an allowable and just selflove     the measures of it ib the love of god for his own sake and without regard to our own happiness is notwithstanding inseparable in its nature from our happiness     all

by dr w cockburn an essay of health and long life    it is a common saying that every man past forty is either a fool or a physician it might have been as justly added that he was a divine too for as the world goes at present there is not any thing that the generality of the better sort of mankind so lavishly and so unconcernedly throw away as health except eternal felicity most men know when they are ill but very few when they are well and yet it is most certain that it is easier to preserve health than to recover it and to prevent diseases than to cure them toward the first the means are mostly in our own power little else is required than to bear and forbear but toward the latter the means are perplexed and uncertain and for the knowledge of them the far greatest part of mankind must apply to others of whose skill and honesty they are in a great measure ignorant and the benefit of whose art they can but conditionally and precautiously obtain a crazy constitution original weak nerves dearbought experience in things helpful and hurtful and long observation on the complaints of others who came for relief to this universal infirmary bath have at last in some measure taught me some of the most effectual means of preserving health and prolonging life in those who are tender and sickly and labor under chronical distempers and i thought i could not spend my leisure hours better than by putting together the most general rules for that purpose and setting them in the clearest and strongest light i could for the benefit of those who may want them and yet have not had such favorable opportunities to learn them     and that i might write with some order and connection i have chosen to make some observations and reflections on the nonnaturals as they are called possibly because that in their preternatural state they are eminently injurious to human constitutions or more probably because though they be necessary to the subsistence of man yet in respect of him they may be considered as external or different from the internal causes that produce diseases to wit   the air we breathe in   our meat and drink   our sleep and watching   our exercise and rest   our evacuations and their obstructions   the passions of our minds and lastly to add some observations that come not so naturally under any of these heads i shall not consider here how philosophically these distinctions are made they seem to me the best general heads for bringing in those observations and reflections i am to make in the following pages     the reflection is not more common than just that he who lives physically must live miserably the truth is too great nicety and exactness about every minute circumstance that may impair our health is such a yoke and slavery as no man of a generous free spirit would submit to it is as a poet expresses it to die for fear of dying and to forbear or give over a just charitable or even generous office of life from a too scrupulous regard to health is unworthy of a man much more of a christian but then on the other hand to cut off our days by intemperance indiscretion and guilty passions to live miserably for the sake of gratifying a sweet tooth or a brutal itch to die martyrs to our luxury and wantonness is equally beneath the dignity of human nature and contrary to the homage we owe to the author of our being without some degree of health we can neither be agreeable to ourselves nor useful to our friends we can neither relish the blessings of divine providence to us in life nor acquit ourselves of our duties to our maker or our neighbor he that wantonly transgresses the selfevident rules of health is guilty of a degree of selfmurder and an habitual perseverance therein is direct selfmurder suicide and consequently the greatest crime he can commit against the author of his being as it is slighting and despising the noblest gift he could bestow upon him viz the means of making himself infinitely happy and also as it is a treacherous forsaking the post wherein his wisdom has placed him and thereby rendering himself incapable of answering the designs of his providence over him the infinitely wise author of nature has so contrived things that the most remarkable rules of preserving life and health are moral duties commanded us so true it is that godliness has the promises of this life as well as that to come  to avoid all useless refinement i will lay down only a few plain easily observed rules which a man may readily follow without any trouble or constraint chap i of air    air being one of the most necessary things toward the subsistence and health of all animals it is a wonder to me that here in england where luxury and all the arts of living well are cultivated even to a vice the choice of air should be so little considered     from observations on bleeding in rheumatisms and after catching cold it is evident that the air with its different qualities can alter and quite vitiate the whole texture of the blood and animal juices from the palsies vertigoes vapors and other nervous affections caused by damps mines and working on some minerals  vide ramazini of the diseases of tradesmen particularly mercury and antimony it is plain air so and so qualified can relax and obstruct the whole nervous system from the cholics fluxes coughs and consumptions produced by damp moist and nitrous air it is manifest that it can obstruct and spoil the noble organs the air is attracted and received into our habit and mixed with our fluids every instant of our lives so that any ill quality in the air so continually introduced must in time produce fatal effects on the animal economy and therefore it will be of the utmost consequence to every one to take care what kind of air it is they sleep and watch breath and live in and are perpetually receiving into the most intimate union with the principles of life i shall only take notice of three conditions of air     the first is that when gentlemen build seats they ought never to place them upon any high hill very near any great confluence of water in the neighborhood of any great mines or beds of minerals nor on any swamp marshy or mossy foundation but either in a champaign country or on the side of a small eminence sheltered from the north and east winds or upon a light gravelly soil the nature of the soil will be well known from the plants and herbs that grow on it or rather more securely from the nature of the waters that spring out of it which ought always to be sweet clear light soft and tastless all high mountains are damp as dr halley observed at st helena a mountainous place where damps fell so perpetually in the night time that he was obliged to be every moment wiping his glasses in making his astronomical observations and where the mountains are high the inhabitants of them are forced to send their furniture in winter to the valley lest it should rot and it is common to have it rain or snow on mountains when the valleys below are clear screne and dry all great hills are nests of minerals and covers made of the prominent earth for reservoirs of rainwater the clouds are but great fleeces of rarefied water sailing in the air sometimes not many yards above the champaign country and these high hills intercepting them they are compressed into dew and rain and are perpetually drilling down the crannies of the mountains into these basins hence the origin of rivers and fresh water springs besides that these mountainous places are always exposed to high and almost perpetual winds where any great concourse of water is the air must needs be perpetually damp because the sun is perpetually straining from these waters moist dews and vapors through it all great nests of minerals or large mines must necessarily impregnate the air with their respective qualities and mossy blackness is some degree of putrefaction as see his treatise about light and colors sir isaac newton observes    secondly the winds that are most frequent and most pernicious in england are the easterly especially the north east winds which in the winter are the most piercing cold in summer the most parching hot in winter they bring along with them all the nitre of the northern and scythian snows mountains of ice and frozen seas through which they come and in summer blow with all the fiery particles of the perpetual day they pass through from the end of january till toward the end of may the wind blows almost perpetually from the eastern and northern points if the spring is dry and from the southern and western points if the spring is wet and generally from the setting in of the winds on a newmoon you may predict the weather of the spring and our bodies most certainly attracting the circumambient air and the fumes of those bodies that are next to us it will be very convenient for valetudinary studious and contemplative persons in a dry spring or in easterly winds to change their bedchambers into rooms that have western or southern lights or to shut close up the eastern and northern lights or to have them but seldom opened and in wet seasons to take the contrary course and if any such person has been much exposed or long abroad in a northerly or bleakish easterly wind it will be very proper for him to drink down going to bed a large draught of warm water gruel or of warm small mountainwine whey as an antidote against the nitrous effluvia sucked into the body and to open the obstructions of the perspiration made thereby     thirdly from the beginning of november till toward the beginning of february london is covered over with one universal nitrous and sulphurous smoke from the multitude of coal fires the absence of that material divinity the sun and the consequence thereof the falling of the dews and vapors of the night in such a season weak and tender people and those that are subject to nervous or pulmonick distempers ought either to go into the country or to be at home soon after sunset and to dispel the damps with clear warm fires and cheerful conversation go early to bed and rise proportionally sooner in the morning for as the suns removal suffers the vapors to fall and condense in the evening so his approach dispels and raises them in the morning i need not add that it will be very fit for those that are valetudinary to have their servants children bedfellows and all those that approach them with whom they live constantly and mix atmospheres to be as healthy sound and sweet as possibly they can and for their own sakes to have them removed till they are made so if they are otherwise nor shall i add any pressing instances to avoid wet rooms damp beds and foul linen or to remove ordure and nusances the luxury of england having run all these rather into a vice     the air is a fluid wherein parts of all kinds of bodies swim as in water but air differs from water in this that the first is compressible into a lesser compass and smaller volume like a fleece of wool either by its own weight or any other force which weight or force being removed the air immediately recovers its former bulk and dimensions again whereas no force whatever can bring water into narrower bounds that is air is extremely elastick and springy but water is not at all so yet the parts of air would seem to be grosser than the parts of water for water will get through a bladder and may be forced through the pores of gold but air will pass through neither by this its elastick force the air insinuates itself into the patent cavities of all animal bodies and the infant which never breathed before as soon as it is exposed to this element has the little bladders whereof the lungs consist blown up into a perpendicular erection on the branches of the windpipe whereby the obstruction from the pressure of these vesicles arising from their being compressed together and lying upon one another being in some measure taken off the muscular action of the right ventricle of the heart is able to force the blood through the lungs into the left ventricle but these little bladders being thus inflated by an elastick fluid still press so far upon and grind the grosser particles of the blood into more sizeable ones that they may become small enough to circulate through the other capillary vessels of the body this elastick air pressing equally every way round by its weight and spring shuts close the scales of the scarfskin of healthy and strong persons so that it denies all entrance to the nitrous and watery mixture contained in it and thus becomes a kind of cold bath to them and defends them from catching cold but in sickly studious and sedentary people and those of weak nerves where the spring of the coverlets and scales that defend the mouths of the perspiratory ducts is weak the perspiration little or next to none at all and the blood poor and sizey the nitrous and watery particles of the air get a ready and free entrance by these ducts into the blood and by breaking the globules thereof coagulating and fixing its fluidity quite stop the perspiration and obstruct all the capillary vessels the cutaneous glands and those of the lungs and alimentary passages when such bodies are long exposed to such an air and thus begets all these disorders in the body that air thus and thus poisoned was shown capable to produce so long as the perspiration is strong brisk and full it is impossible any of these disorders should happen because the force of the perspiratory steams outward is greater than the force whereby these noxious mixtures enter unless the body be indiscreetly too long exposed or the action of the nitrous and watery mixtures be extremely violent hence it comes to pass that those who are very strong and healthy and those who have drank strong liquors so plentifully as to have thereby a brisk circulation and full perspiration seldom or never catch cold and this is the reason why rich foods and generous wines moderately used become so excellent an antidote in infectious and epidemick distempers not only as they banish fear and terror but as they make so full and free a stream of perspiration and maintain so active and brisk an atmosphere as suffers no noxious steams or mixtures in the air to come within it but drives and beats off the enemy to a distance but persons of viscous heavy fluids of poor and sizey juices of little or no perspiration such as generally all studious sedentary and sickly persons are but especially those that are subject to nervous disorders must necessarily suffer under these poisonous mixtures in the air if they do not cautiously and carefully fence against them or take not a present remedy and antidote when tainted for besides the air that gets through the perspiratory ducts into the blood whenever we eat drink or breath we are taking into our bodies such air as is about us and when the concoctive powers are weak as in such persons and the quantity of the food is too great or its quality too strong for them the chyle is too gross and the perspiratory matter is stopped because too large for these small ducts and this whole mass which in common health is more than double of the gross evacuations recoils in upon the bowels and becomes as it were spears and darts and armor to the air received from without which being thus sharpened with the salts of the unconcocted food together with its own elastick force pierces the sides of the vessels and gets into all the cavities of the body and between the muscles and their membranes and there in time brings forth hypochondriack hysteric nervous and vapourish disorders and all that black train of evils such constitutions suffer under  i shall now draw out the cautions here inculcated into a few general rules general rules for health and long life drawn from the head of air   the healthiest situation for a seat is in a champaign country or on the side of a small eminence on a gravelly soil with a southern or western exposition sheltered from the north and east winds distant from any great concourse of waters or any great mines or beds of minerals where the water is sweet clear light soft and tastless   tender people on the setting in of easterly and northerly winds ought to change their bedrooms for others of westerly and southerly lights and the contrary in wet seasons   those who have been much exposed to or long abroad in easterly or northerly winds should drink some thin and warm liquor going to bed   when the dark dull foggy weather lasts at london in winter tender people and those of weak nerves and lungs ought either to go into the country or keep much at home in warm rooms go early to bed and rise betimes   valetudinary people ought to have their servants children and bedfellows or those they continually approach and converse with sound sweet and healthy or ought to remove them till they are so if they are otherwise   every one in order to pteserve their health ought to observe all the cleanness and sweetness in their houses clothes and furniture suitable to their condition chap ii of meat and drink    to have our food that is our meat and drink as to quantity and quality duly regulated and precisely adjusted to our concoctive powers would be of the utmost consequence to health and long life our bodies require only a determinate quantity thereof to supply the expenses of living and a just proportion of that to these would very probably preserve us from acute most certainly from chronical distempers and enable us to live without much sickness and pain so long as our constitutions were originally made to last the sources of chronical distempers are first viscidity in the juices or the overlargeness of their constituent particles which not being sufficiently broken by the concoctive powers stop or retard the circulation or secondly too great abundance of sharp and acrimonious salts whereby the juices themselves are rendered so corrosive as to burst or wear out the solids or thirdly a relaxation or want of a due force and springiness in the solids themselves an excess in quantity begets the first the ill condition of our meat and drink the second and both together with want of due labor the third     the meat of england is generally animal substances the animals themselves from epidemick causes bad food age or other infirmities have their diseases as well as human creatures and these diseased animals can never be proper or sound food for men adult animals abound more in urinous salts than young ones their parts are more closely compacted because more forcibly united and so harder of digestion it is true the great distinction of the fitness or unfitness of the several sorts of animals and vegetables for human food depends upon their original make frame and nature and that can be found out only by experience as also upon the special taste complexion temperament and habits of the person that feeds on them but by the help of these three principles viz first that the strength or weakness of cohesion of the particles of fluid bodies depends upon their bigness or smallness that is the biggest particles cohere more firmly than the smaller because more parts come into contact in large bodies than small and so their union is greater secondly that the greater the force  momentum is with which two bodies meet the stronger is their cohesion and the more difficult their separation thirdly that salts being comprehended by plain surfaces being hard and in all changes recovering their figure unite the most firmly of any bodies whatsoever their plain surfaces bring many points into contact and union their hardness and constant figure make them durable and unalterable and thereby the active principles and the origin of the qualities of bodies and when they approach within the sphere of one anothers activity they firmly unite in clusters all which make the separation of their original particles the more difficult i say from these three principles we may in general compare the easiness or difficulty of digesting that is breaking into small parts the several sorts of vegetables and animals one with another and so discover their fitness or unfitness for becoming food for tender and valetudinary persons   all other things being supposed equal those vegetables and animals that come to maturity the soonest are lightest of digestion thus the spring vegetables as asparagus strawberries and some sorts of sallading are more easily digested than pears apples peaches and nectarines because they have less of the solar fire in them their parts are united by a weaker heat that is with less velocity and abound less in nay scarce have any strong and fixed salts among the animals the common poultry hares sheep kids rabbets etc who in the same or a few years come to their maturity that is to propagate their species are much more tender and readily digested than cows horses or asses were these last in use for food as they have been in famine etc for the reason already given because their parts cohere less firmly and it is observable of the vegetables which are longest a ripening that is whose juices have most of the solar rays in them that their fermented juices yield the strongest vinous spirits as grapes elderberries and the like and of the animals that are longest in coming to maturity that their juices yield the most rank and most foetid urinous salts   other things supposed equal the larger and bigger the vegetable or animal is in its kind the stronger and the harder to digest is the food made thereof thus a large onion apple or pear and large beef and mutton are harder to digest than the lesser ones of the same kind not only as their vessels being stronger and more elastick their parts are brought together with a greater force but also because the qualities are proportionably more intense in great bodies of the same kind thus other things being equal a greater fire is proportionably more intensely hot than a lesser one and the wine contained in a larger vessel becomes stronger than that contained in a lesser and consequently the juices of larger animals and vegetables are more rank than the juices of smaller ones of the same kind   other things being equal the proper food appointed for animals by nature is easier digested than the animals themselves those animals that live on vegetables than those that live on animals those that live on vegetables or animals that soonest come to maturity than those that live on such as are longer a ripening thus milk and eggs are lighter of digestion than the flesh of beasts or birds pullets and turkies than ducks and geese and partridge and pheasant are lighter than woodcock or snipe because these last being longbilled suck only animal juices and for the reasons already given grass beef and mutton are lighter than stallfed oxen and sheep   all things else being alike fish and seaanimals are harder to digest than landanimals because universally their food is other animals and the salt element in which they live compacts their parts more firmly salts having a stronger power of cohesion than other bodies and for the same reason salt water fish is harder to digest than fresh water thus the sea tortoise is harder to digest than the land tortoise and sturgeon and turbit than trout or perch   other things being equal vegetables and animals that abound in an oily fat and glutinous substance are harder to digest than those of a dry fleshy fibrous substance because oily and fat substances clude the force and action of the concoctive powers and their parts attract one another and unite more strongly than other substances do except salts as sir isaac newton vide sir isaac newtons first english edition of light and colors observes their softness and humidity relaxes and weakens the force of the stomach and the fat and oil itself is shut up in little bladders that are with difficulty broken thus nuts of all kinds pass through the guts almost untouched olives are harder to digest than pease fat flesh meat than the lean of the same carp tench salmon eel and turbit are much harder to digest than whiting perch trout or haddock   vegetables and animals all things else being alike whose substance is white or inclining to the lighter colors are lighter to digest than those whose substance is redder browner or inclining toward the more flaming colors not only because the parts that reflect white and the lighter colors are lesser in bulk than those that reflect the more flaming colors see the just quoted author  but also because those of the more flaming colors abound more with urinious salts thus turnips parsnips and potatoes are lighter than carrots skirrets and beetraves pullet turkey pheasant and rabbet are lighter than duck geese woodcock and snipe whiting flounder perch and soal are lighter than salmon sturgeon herring and mackarel veal and lamb is lighter than red or fallow deer   lastly all other things being equal vegetables and animals of a strong poignant aromatic and hot taste are harder to digest than those of a milder softer and more insipid taste high relish comes from abundance of salts abundance of salts supposes adult animals and such as are long a coming to maturity and where salts abound the parts are more difficultly separated and harder to be digested strong and aromatic plants imbibe and retain most of the solar rays and become solid spirits or fixed flames and they that deal much in them swallow so much livecoals which will at last inflame the fluids and burn up the solids      there is nothing more certain than that the greater superiority the concoctive powers have over the food or the stronger the concoctive powers are in regard of the things to be concocted the finer the chyle will be the circulation the more free and the spirits more lightsome that is the better will the health be now from these general propositions taking in their own particular complexion and habits valetudinary studious or contemplative persons may easily fix upon these particular vegetable or animal foods that are fittest for them and if any error should be committed it is best to err on the safest side and rather choose those things that are under our concoctive powers than those that are above them and in the choice of animals for our food we must not pass over the manner of fattening and fitting them up for the table about london we can scarce have any but crammed poultry or stallfed butchery meat it were sufficient to disgust the stoutest stomach to see the foul gross and nasty manner in which and the fetid putrid and unwholesome materials with which they are fed perpetual foulness and cramming gross food and nastiness we know will putrify the juices and mortify the muscular substance of human creatures and sure they can do no less in brute animals and thus make even our food poison the same may be said of hot beds and forcing plants and vegetables the only way of having sound and healthful animal food is to leave them to their own natural liberty in the free air and their own proper element with plenty of food and due cleanness and a shelter from the injuries of the weather when they have a mind to retire to it i add nothing about cookery plain roasting and boiling is as high as valetudinary tender studious and contemplative persons or those who would preserve their health and lengthen out their days ought to presume on made dishes rich soop high sauces baking smoking salting and pickling are the inventions of luxury to force an unnatural appetite and increase the load which nature without incentives from ill habits and a vicious palate will of itself make more than sufficient for health and long life abstinence and proper evacuations due labor and exercise will always recover a decayed appetite so long as there is any strength and fund in nature to go upon and it is scarce allowble to provoke an appetite with medicinal helps but where the digestive faculties have been spoiled and ruined by acute or tedious chronical distempers and as soon as it is recovered to any tolerable degree nature is to be left to its own work without any spurs from cookery or physic     the next consideration is the quantity of food that is necessary to support nature without overloading it in a due plight that is indeed various according to the age sex nature strength and country the party is of and the exercise he uses in these northern countries the coldness of the air the strength and large stature of people demand larger supplies than in the eastern and warmer countries young growing persons and those of great strength and large stature require more than the aged weak and slender but persons of all sorts will live more healthy and longer by universal temperance than otherwise and some general observations on the quantity persons of different nations and conditions have lived on healthy and to a great age may give some assistance to valetudinary and tender persons to adjust the due quantity necessary for them    it is surprising to what a great age the eastern christians who retired from the persecutions into the deserts of egypt and arabia lived healthful on a very little food we are informed by cassian that the common measure in twenty four hours was about twelve ounces or a pound for the eastern pound was but twelve ounces with mere element for drink st anthony lived to  0  years on mere bread and water adding only a few herbs at last james the hermit to  0  arsenius the tutor of the emperor arcadius to   0    in the world and    in the desert st epiphanus to     st jerome to about  00 simeon stylites  0  and romualdus   0 and lewis cornaro a venetian nobleman after he had used all other remedies in vain so that his life was despaired of at  0 yet recovered and lived by the mere force of his temperance near to  00 years    our northern climate as i said from the purity and coldness of the air which bracing the fibers makes the appetite keener and the action of digestition stronger and from the labor and strength of the people which makes the expenses of living more will necessarily require a greater quantity of food yet it is wonderful in what sprightliness stength activity and fredom of spirits a low diet even here will preserve those that have habituated themselves to it buchanan informs us of one laurence who preserved himself to   0 by the mere force of temperance and labor spotswood mentions one kentigern afterward called st mongah or mungo from whom the famous well in wales is named who lived to     years though after he came to the years of understanding he never tasted wine nor strong drink and slept on the cold ground my worthy friend mr web is still alive he by the quickness of the faculties of the mind and the activity of the organs of his body shows the great benefit of a low diet living altogether on vegetable food and pure element the history of the milk see an essay on the gout and bath waters doctor of croydon who by living on milk only cured himself of an otherwise incurable distemper viz the epilepsy and lived in perfect health for sixteen years after till an accident cut him off i have already narrated in my treatise of the gout henry jenkins a fisherman lived     years his diet was coarse and sower as his historian informs us that is plain and cooling and the air where he lived sharp and clear viz allerton upon swale in yorkshire parr died sixteen years younger viz at the age of     years   months his diet was old cheese milk coarse bread small beer and whey and his historian tells us he might have lived a good while longer if he had not changed his diet and air coming out of a clear thin free air into the thick air of london and after a constant plain and homely country diet being taken into a spendid family where he fed high and drank plentifully of the best wines whereby the natural functions of the parts were overcharged and the habit of the whole body quite disordered upon which there could not but soon ensue a dissolution see abr of philos transact by lowth dr lister mentions eight persons in the north of england the youngest of which was above  00 years and the eldest   0 he says it is to be observed that the food of all this mountainous country is exceedingly coarse and certainly there is no place in the world more likely to lengthen out life than england especially those parts of it that have a free open air and a gravelly and chalky soil if to due exercise abstemiousness and a plain simple diet were added     i have see the essay of the gout and bath waters elsewhere offered to determine the quantity of food sufficient to keep a man of an ordinary stature following no laborious employment in due plight health and vigor to wit   ounces of flesh meat    of bread or vegetable food and about a pint of wine or other generous liquor in    hours but the valetudinary and those employed in sedentary professions or intellectual studies must lessen this quantity if they would preserve their health and the freedom of their spirits long studious and sedentary men must of necessity eat and drink a great deal less than those very same men might do were they engaged in an active life for as they want that exercise that is necessary toward concoction and perspiration and that their nerves are more worn out by intellectual studies than even bodily labor would waste them if in any wise they indulge freedom of living their juices must necessarily become viscid and their stomachs relaxed he that would have a clear head must have a clean stomach the neglect of which is the cause why we see so many hypochondriacal melancholy and vapourish gentlemen among those of the long robe the only remedy of which is labor and abstinence     most of all the chronical diseases the infirmities of old age and the short periods of the lives of englishmen are owing to repletion this is evident from hence because evacuation of one kind or another is nine parts of ten in their remedy for not only cupping bleeding blistering issues purging vomiting and sweating are manifest evacuations or drains to draw out what has been superfluously taken down but even abstinence exercise alteratives cordials bitters and alexipharmicks are but several means to dispose the gross humors to be more readily evacuated by insensible perspiration that new and well concocted chyle and sweet comminuted juices may take their place to restore the habit and therefore it were much more easy as well as more safe and effectual to prevent than incur the necessity of such evacuations and any one may lose a pound of blood take a purge or a sweat by dropping the great meal or abstaining from animal food and strong liquors for four or five days in chronical cases as effectually as by opening a vein swallowing a dose of pills or taking a sudorifick bolus     i advise therefore all gentlemen of a sedentary life and of learned professions to use as much abstinence as possibly they can consistent with the preservation of their strength and freedom of spirits which ought to be done as soon as they find any heaviness inquietudes restless nights or aversion to application either by lessening one half of their usual quantity of animal food and strong liqours till such time as they regain their wonted freedom and indolence or by living a due time wholly upon vegetable diet such as sago rice pudding and the like and drinking only a little wine and water and if they would preserve their health and constitution and lengthen out their days they must either inviolably live low or maigre as the french call it a day or two in the week or once a week fortnight or month at farthest take some domestic purge which shall require neither diet nor keeping at home but may at once strengthen the bowels and discharge superfluous humors of this kind are a dose   or   of the scotch pills half a dram of the pilulae stomachicae cum gummi with three or four grains of diagryd mixed half a dram of the pilulae ruffi two ounces of hiera piera with one dram of the syrup of buckthorn two or three ounces of elixir salutis or what i prefer before all these this preparation of rhubarb  take the best rhubarb in powder two ounces and a half salt of wormwood a dram orange peel half an ounce grated nutmeg two scruples cochineal half a dram infusc    hours by a warm fireside in a quart of true arrack strain it off and put it in a well corked bottle for use  of this two or three spoonfuls may be taken two or three times a week or at pleasure with great safety and benefit without interruption of business or studies and continued even to mature old age if found necessary so true is old verulams aphorism nothing contributes more to health and long life than frequent family purges nihil magis conducit ad sanitatem and longaevitatem quam crebrae and domesticae purgationes and the gentlemen of the long robe those of learned professions and contemplative studies must of necessity at last take sir charles scarboroughs advice as it is said to the duchess of portsmouth you must eat less or use more exercise or take physic or be sick    0 those who have written about health have given many rules whereby to know when any person has exceeded at a meal i think there needs but this short one which is if any man has eat or drank so much as renders him unfit for the duties and studies of his profession after an hours sitting quiet to carry on the digestion he has overdone i mean only of those of learned professions and studious lives for those of mechanical employments must take the body the other part of the compound into consideration if tender people and those of learned professions would go by this rule there would be little use for physic or physicians in chronical cases or if they would but eat only one part of animal food at the great meal and make the other two of vegetable food and drink only water with a spoonful of wine or clear small beer their appetites would be a sufficient rule to determine the quantity of their meat and drink but variety of dishes the luxurious artfulness of cookery and swallowing rich wine after every bit of meat so lengthen out the appetite the fondness of mothers and the cramming of nurses have so stretched the capacities of receiving that there is no security from the appetite among the better sort it is amazing to think how men of voluptuousness laziness and poor constitutions should imagine themselves able to carry off loads of highseasoned foods and inflammatory liquors without injury or pain when men of mechanic employments and rubust constitutions are scarcely able to live healthy and in vigor to any great age on a simple low and almost vegetable diet      since then our appetites are deceitful and weight and measure troublesome and singular we must have recourse to a rule independent of our sensations and free from unnecessary trouble and pain to answer which i know nothing but eating and drinking by our eye that is determining first of all either by weight or measure or by particular observation or experiment the bulk or number of mouthfuls of flesh meat and the number of glasses of strong liquors under which we are best and then by our eye determining an equal quantity at all times for the future thus the two wings of a middling pullet or one wing and both legs three ribs of a middling neck of mutton two middling slices of a leg or shoulder throwing away the fat and the skin somewhat less of beef may be sufficient for flesh meat at the great meal for we are so wisely contrived that our food need not be adjusted to mathematical points a little over or under will make no difference in our health as for pork and all kinds of hogs flesh i think they ought to be forbidden valetudinary and studious people as they were the jews they feed the foulest of any creature and their juices are the rankest their substance the most surfeiting and they are the most subject to cutaneous diseases and putrefaction of any creature insomuch that in the time of a plague or any epidemical distemper they are universally destroyed by all wise nations as the southern people do mad dogs in the hot months the same censure i should pass upon all fish most fish live in a saltish element and come only into fresh water rivers for the quietness and convenience of bringing forth their young ones this makes their parts more closely united and harder of digestion besides as i have before observed they feed upon one another and their juices abound with a salt that corrupts the blood and breeds chronical diseases and it is always observable that those who live much on fish are infected with the scurvy cutaneous eruptions and the other diseases of a foul blood and every body finds himself more thirsty and heavy than usual after a full meal of fish let them be ever so fresh and is generally forced to have recourse to spirits and distilled liquors to carry them off so that it is become a proverb among those that live much upon them that brandy is latin for fish besides that after a full meal of fish even at noon one never sleeps so sound the ensuing night as is certain from constant observation these few hints may serve the valetudinary person in a gross manner to judge by the eye the quantity of solid flesh meat he takes or ought to take down for i judge the mentioned quantities to be rather a little under than over eight ounces as to broths soops and jellies if they be strong i account them equal in nourishment and harder to digest than the same weight of solid flesh meat and three or four common spoonfuls atmost make an ounce in weight in liquids and about double the number of bits commonly swallowed at once make the same weight in solid flesh meat for exactness is not here requisite      drink is the other part of our food the common drink here in england is either water maltliquor or wine or mixtures of these for cider and perry are drank but in few places and rather for pleasure and variety than common use without all peradventure water was the primitive original beverage as it is the only simple fluid for there are but three more in nature mercury light and air none of which is fit for human drink fitted for diluting moistening and cooling the ends of drink appointed by nature and happy had it been for the race of mankind other mixed and artificial liquors had never been invented it has been an agreeable appearance to me to observe with what freshness and vigor those who though eating freely of flesh meat yet drank nothing but this element have lived in health indolence and cheerfulness to a great age water alone is sufficient and effectual for all the purposes of human wants in drink strong liquors were never designed for common use they were formerly kept here in england as other medicines are in apothecaries shops and prescribed by physicians as they do diascordium and venicetreacle to refresh the weary to strengthen the weak to give courage to the fainthearted and raise the lowspirited and it were as just and reasonable to see men and if they go on it is not impossible i may hear of it since laudanum is already taken into feasts and entertainments sit down to a dish of venicetreacle or sir walter rawleighs confection with a bottle of hysteric cordial as to a dish of crawfishsoop an oxcheek or venisonpasty with a bottle of hermitage or tockay or which some prefer to either of them a bowl of punch wine is now become as common as water and the better sort scarce ever dilute their food with any other liquor and we see by daily experience that as natural causes will always produce their proper effects their blood becomes inflammed into gout stone and rheumamatism raging fevers pleurisies small pox or measles their passions are enraged into quarrels murder and blasphemy their juices are dried up and their solids scorched and shriveld those whose appetite and digestion is good and entire never want strong liquors to supply spirits such spirits are too volatile and fugitive for any solid or useful purposes in life two ounces of flesh meat well digested beget a greater stock of more durable and useful spirits than ten times as much strong liquors which nothing but luxury and concupiscence makes necessary happy those whom their parents their natural aversion to strong liquors or whom kind providence among the better sort has brought to the age of maturity and discretion without dealing in or desiring any great quantity of strong liquors their passions have been calmer their sensations more exquisite their appetites less unruly and their health more uninterrupted than any other natural cause could have produced and thrice happy they who continue this course to their last minutes nothing is more ridiculous than the common plea for continuing in drinking on large quantities of spirituous liquors viz because they have been accustomed so to do and they think it dangerous to leave it off all of a sudden it were as reasonable for him that is fallen into the fire or water to lie there because of the danger of removing him suddenly for neither element will destroy him more certainly before his time than wallowing in strong liquors if the quantity of strong liquors they have been accustomed to may be supposed prejudicial to their health or to introduce noxious humors into the habit the sooner a stop be put to it the better no man is afraid to forbear strong liquors in an acute distemper what quantity soever he might have drank in his health and yet any sudden change of the humors would not only be more dangerous then than at any other time but also would more readily happen and come to pass in such critical cases for the whole system of the fluids being in a fermentation small changes or errors then would not only be more fatal but more plain and obvious and if a person be in hazard by such a sudden alteration he cannot live long by taking down so much poison but the matter of fact is false and groundless for i have known and observed constant good effects from leaving off suddenly great quantities of wine and flesh meats too by those long accustomed to both am ready to name the persons and never observed any ill consequence from it in any case whatsoever those whose constitutions have been quite broken and running into dissolution have lived longer and been less pained in sickness by so doing and those who have had a fund in nature to last longer have grown better and attained their end by it i allow every man that has been accustomed to drink wine or strong liquors a pint in    hours and i am well satisfied that quantity is sufficient for health let their custom have been what it will their spirits may indeed flag and sink a little at first for want of introduced quicklime and fire but lowspiritedness in such a case i count no disease and bearing it for some time is bountifully recompensed by the health indolence and freedom of spirits they afterward enjoy not taking into consideration their being rescued from the tyranny of so immoral and mischievous a habit it may be sufficient for those who are tender studious or contemplative to drink three glasses of water with a spoonful of wine at the great meal and as sir w temple has it one for your self another for your friends a third for good humor and a fourth for your enemies are more than sufficient after it      a great mistake committed in this affair is that most people think the only remedy for gluttony is drunkenness or that the cure of a surfeit of meat is a surfeit of wine than which nothing can be more false or contrary to nature for it is lighting as the saying is the candle at both ends for first of all wine and all other strong liquors are as hard to digest and require as much labor of the concoctive powers as strong food itself this is not only evident with respect to people of weak stomachs but also from hence that healthy people who drink only water or weak small beer shall be able to eat and digest almost double of what they could did they drink strong liquors at their meals as every one that pleases may experience water is the only universal dissolvent or menstruum and the most certain diluter of all bodies proper for food though there are a great many that spirituous liquors not only will not dissolve but will harden and make more undigestible especially the salts of bodies wherein their active qualities that is those which can do most harm to human constitutions consist and i have known men of weak and tender constitutions who could neither eat nor digest upon drinking of wine who by drinking at meals common water heated have recovered their appetites and digestion have thriven and grown plump it is true strong liquors by their heat and stimulation on the organs of concoction by increasing the velocity of the motion of the fluids and thereby quickening the other animal functions will carry off the load that lies upon the stomach with more present cheerfulness yet besides the future damages of such a quantity of wine to the stomach and to the fluids by its heat and inflammation the food is hurried into the habit unconcocted and lays a foundation for a fever a fit of the cholick or some chronical disease      another mistake i shall observe is the extreme fondness persons of the better sort here in england have lately run into for the strong and high country wines i can think of no reason for this but the very honest one the vulgar give for drinking brandy that they get sooner drunk on it for surely the middling lighter wines inflame the animal juices less go more easily off the stomach and afford more room for long conversation and cheerfulness excess in them gives less pain and is sooner remedied but there are degrees in this matter no body becomes extremely bad all at once nemo repent fuit turpissimus they begin with the weaker wines these by use and habit will not do they leave the stomach sick and mawkish they must fly to stronger wine and stronger still and run the rise higher by degrees climax through brandy to barbados waters and double distilled spirits till at last they can find nothing hot enough for them people who have any regard for their health or lives ought to tremble at the first cravings for such poisonous liquors strong waters should never be taken but by the direction of a physician or in the agonies of death for when persons arrive at that state that they become necessary to their ease and freedom of spirits they may be justly reckoned among the dead both as to the short time they have to live and the little use they can be of either to themselves or mankind i speak not here of those who are under an actual fit of the gout or cholick in the stomach  we must not die for fear of dying nor am i recommending sour verjuice or unripe wines but i cannot help being well satisfied both from reason and experience that the light wines of a moderate strength due age and full maturity are much preferable for cheerfulness and conversation much more wholesome for human constitutions and much more proper for digestion than the hot and strong wines the rich strong and heavy wines ought never to be tasted without a sufficient dilution of water at least they should be used like brandy or spirits for a cordial i e at most to take but three small glasses of such  ad summum tria pocula sum whatsoever is more comes of sin and must be diluted with the waters of repentance      i have no intention here to discourage the innocent means of enlivening conversation promoting friendship comforting the sorrowful heart and raising the drooping spirits by the cheerful cup and the social repast perhaps i may like the harmless frolic the warm reception of a friend and even the horat i e an agreeable frolic or extravagance dulce furere itself more than i ought persons sober in the main will receive little prejudice from such a fillip when the occasions happen but seldom and especially when they make it up by a greater degree of abstinence afterward but a sot is the lowest character in life did only the profligate the scoundrel the abandoned run into these excesses it were in vain to endeavor to reclaim them as it were to stop a tempest or calm a storm but now that the vice is become epidemical since it has got not only among mechanics and tradesmen but among persons of the brightest genius the finest taste and the most accomplished parts and oh that i could give my conscience the lie in mentioning them even among the first and least fallen part of the creation itself and those of them too of the most elegant parts and the strictest virtue otherwise and which is still the most surprising of all even those too who are in all other respects blameless since i say the case is so it will not be amiss to show to the evidence of a demonstration the folly as well as the fruitlessness of such a course a fit of the colic or of the vapors a familymisfortune a casual disappointment the death of a child or of a friend with the assistance of the nurse the midwife and the next neighbor often give rise and become the weighty causes of so fatal an effect a little lowness requires drops which pass readily down under the notion of physic drops beget drams and drams beget more drams till they come to be without weight and without measure so that at last the miserable creature suffers a true martyrdom between its natural modesty the great necessity of concealing its cravings and the still greater one of getting them satisfied some how higher and more severe fits of hystericks tremors and convulsions begot by these bring forth farther necessity upon necessity of drops drams and gills till at last a kind dropsy nervous convulsions a nervous atrophy or a colloquative diarrhaea if not a fever or a frenzy set the poor soul free it has very often raised in me the most melancholy reflections to see even the virtuous and the sensible bound in such chains and fetters as nothing less than omnipotent grace or the unrelenting grave could release them they were deaf to reason and medicine to their own experience and even to the express words of scripture that says the drunkard shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven did this bewitching poison actually cure or relieve them from time to time something might be said to extenuate the folly and frenzy of such a course but on the contrary it heightens and enrages all their symptoms and sufferings ever afterward excepting the few moments immediately after taking it down and every dram begets the necessity of two more to cure the ill effects of the first and one minutes indolence they purchase with many hours of greater pain and misery besides the making the malady more incurable lowspiritedness in itself is no disease besides that there are remedies in art that will always relieve it so long as there is any oil remaining in the lamp and it is in vain to try to raise the dead exercise abstinence and proper evacuations with time and patience will continually make it tolerable very often they will persectly cure it the running into drams is giving up the whole at once for neither laudanum nor arsenick will kill more certainly although more quickly the pretense of its being physic or a present remedy is trifling cordials of any kind even out of the apothecaries shops are but reprieves for a time to gain a respite till proper and extirpating remedies can take place and are never to be used twice the one immediately after the other but in the last necessity and i can honestly say i never failed of relieving so as to make life tolerable vapourish hysterical or hypochondriacal persons who would be governed in their diet by the use of other proper means if their was a fund in life and no incurable disease complicated with lowness thus much the weight of the subject forced from one more than this its disagreeableness hinders me to say      next to drams no liquor deserves more to be stigmatized and banished the repasts of the tender valetudinary and studious than punch it is a composition of such parts as not one of them is salutary or kindly to such constitutions except the pure element in it the principal ingredient is rum arrack brandy or malt spirits as they are called all of them raised by the fire from the fermented juices of plants brought from southern countries or which have longest born the heat of the sun in our own climate and it is observable that every thing that has past the fire so that it has had due time to divide and penetrate its parts as far as it possibly can retains a caustic corrosive and burning quality ever afterward this is evident from the fiery and burning touch and taste of newdrawn spirits as also from the burning of limestone which though extinguished by boiling water does ever after retain its heating and drying quality as appears from the great use of limewater in drying up all humid sores when given inwardly by itself or compounded with sudorific woods and roots and from its success in outward applications for the same purposes and though time may in some measure get the better of this in its sensible and obvious operations yet since water is a grosser body than fire or flame it never can penetrate it so far as quite to extinguish its inmost heat especially if we consider that spirits are but an accumulation of fine salts and light oil compacted together into the smallest volume the first whereof is so hard and solid as naturally to retain their heat the longest into which water cannot enter the other to wit the oil is so inflamable that it most readily receives heat and fire and defends the salts from the power of the water over them and in the continued distillation of spirits this action of the fire is so strong as to reduce them to liquid flames at last which will of themselves evaporate in visible flames and fumes the other principal part of the composition is the juice of oranges and lemons and if we consider that a lemon or orange could never be transported half seas over to us without rotting or spoiling if gathered when wholly ripe we should have no great opinion of their juices every spanish or portugal merchant can inform us that they must be gathered green or at least a month before they are ripe else they are not fit to be sent beyond the seas the seaair and their being shut up close gives them that golden yellow color we so much admire the juice of a crab apple of unripe grapes or gooseberries or even good juice of sorrel would come up at least to their virtue of extinguishing the heat of spirits if not to their flavor and how kindly a guest such juices would be to the fine fibers of weak stomachs and bowels i leave every one to judge the truth is all fermenting juices such as these eminently are must be highly injurious to weak constitutions for meeting with the crudities in the bowels they must raise a new battle and colluctation there and so must blow up the whole cavities of the human body with acrid fumes and vapors the great and sore enemy of such bowels and in the west indies where from the necessity of drinking much because of the violence of the heat and from the want of proper liquors there they are forced to drink much punch though lemons and oranges be in their full perfection they are universally afflicted with nervous and mortal drybellyaches palsies cramps and convulsions which cut them off in a few days entirely owing to this poisonous mixture  the bathwater is the only remedy in such cases whither they all hasten if they can get thither alive and here i have been informed of this fact by men of the profession as well as their patients who universally ascribed them to their drinking of punch and spirituous liquors if acids must be had without all peradventure the vinous ones are the best and safest the romans though they had the vegetable acids in perfection made very little use of them but in cookery where the quantity of the poison was so small as not to do sufficient harm to forbid their using them for the sake of the exquisite relish they gave their sauces and the constant drink of the lower soldiery was vinegar and water which they found of excellent use both as it prevented fevers plagues and putrefaction and also as it gave an energy to the unactive element and hindered it from lodging in the body hence also the great use of oxymel and oxycrate that is of vinegar with honey and with water among all the ancient physicians and indeed whenever they prescribed an acid they very prudently joined a corrective with it both to promote its good and to prevent it is bad effects the two remaining ingredients are sugar and water and these i will give up to the punchdrinkers and allow them all the benefit of them they can bring to this composition yet it will still have malignity sufficient remaining to be held in detestation at least for any great use or in any great quantity for some poisons are so only by their quantity by those tender and valetudinary persons who value health and life the strong the voluptuous and the abandoned need no advice at least they will take none i could never see any temptation for any one in their senses to indulge in this heathenish liquor but that it makes it is votaries the soonest and all of a sudden the deepest drunk holds them longest in the fit and deprives them the most entirely of the use of their intellectual faculties and bodily organs of any liquor whatsoever it is likest opium both in it is nature and in the manner of its operation and nearest arsenick in it is deleterious and poisonous qualities and so i leave it to them  who knowing this will yet drink on and die    as to malt liquors they are not much in use excepting small beer with any but mechanics and foxhunters the french very justly call them barleysoop i am well satisfied a weak stomach can as readily and with less pain digest pork and peasesoop as yorkshire or nottingham ale they make excellent birdlime and when simmerd some time over a gentle fire make the most sticking and the best plaster for old strains that can be contrived even the smallbeer that is commonly drank at london if it be not well boiled very clear and of a due age must be hurtful to persons of weak nerves and slow digestion for fermenting again in the alimentary channels it will fill the whole cavities of the body with windy fumes and vapors which will at length play odd pranks in a crasy constitution in fine the valetudinary studious and contemplative must be contented with a pint of middling light wine a day one half with and the other without water     since the time foreign luxury has been brought to it is perfection here there are a kind of liquors in use among the better sort which some great doctors have condemned by bell book and candle and others have as extravagantly commended i mean coffee tea and chocolate for my own part i take all their virtue to consist in custom and all their harm in excess as to coffee it is a mere calx or a kind of burnt horse bean but lighter on the stomach and of somewhat a better flavor the turks use it and opium instead of brandy but the plea that some make for running into excess in it from this mohammedan custom is altogether weak and groundless for those that do so there suffer by it as we do here and those that debauch in it turn stupid feeble and paralitick by it especially when they join opium with it as they frequently do as those who wallow in these do here and are as much despised and exposed by serious persons as our topers and brandyswillers are here a dish or two of coffee with a little milk to soften it in raw or damp weather or on a waterish and phlegmatic stomach is not only innocent but a present relief but it is as ridiculous and perhaps more hurtful at least in thin and dry habits to dabble in it two or three times every day as it would be for such to drink nothing but scalding limewater there are two kinds of tea in use green and bohea mr cuningham who lived several years in china a very learned and accurate person vide phil collect informs us that they are both gathered from the same shrub but at different seasons of the year and that the bohea is gathered in the spring and is dried in the sun the green at the fire but i suspect and not without authority that besides these differences in drying some infusion of another plant or earth perhaps such a one as that of japan earth or catechu must be poured on some sorts of bohea tea to give it the softness flavor and heaviness on the stomach it has whereby it becomes a mere drug and wants the natural simplicity of green tea which when light and drank neither too strong nor too hot i take to be a very proper diluent when softened with a little milk to cleanse the alimentary passages and wash off the scorbutic and urinous salts for a breakfast to those who live full and free as also it or tea made of a sliced orange or lemon is one of the best promoters of digestion after a full meal or when one is adry between meals and much more safe and effectual than drams or strong cordials which are commonly used for that purpose some persons of weak tender nerves fall into lowness and trembling upon using either of these liquors with any freedom from their too great quantity or their irritation on the tender and delicate fibers of the stomach such ought carefully to avoid and abstain from them as from drams and drops but i can never be of their opinion who ascribe the frequency of scurvy vapors lowspiritedness and nervous distempers now to what they were in the days of our forefathers to the custom of drinking more frequently and freely of these foreign infusions the cause is not adequate to the effect nor indeed has any analogy to or connection with it we know that warm water will most of any thing promote and assist digestion in weak stomachs and tender nerves and by this alone i have seen several such persons recover to a miracle when cold mineral waters bitters cordials and drams have done rather hurt than good and tea is but an infusion in water of an innocent plant innocent i say because we find by its taste it has neither poisonous deleterious nor acrimonious qualities and we are certain from it is use in the countries it comes from which are larger than most of europe that they receive no damage from it but on the contrary that it promotes both digestion and perspiration the argument from its relaxing the coats of the stomach and bowels by its heat is of no force for unless it be drunk much hotter than the blood itself it can do no hurt that way and we see the bath guides who dabble in water almost as hot as tea is ever drunk a great part of the day and for one half of the year at least are no ways injured by it except when they drink strong liquors too freely to quench the thirst it raises however i should advise those who drink tea plentifully not to drink it much hotter than bloodwarm whereby they will receive all its benefit and be secure against all the harm it can possibly do as to chocolate i am of opinion it is too hot and heavy for valetudinary persons and those of weak nerves i have before observed that nuts pass through the alimentary passages untouched and though they may part with some of their more volatile particles yet i doubt if they can afford much nourishment to persons of weak digestions some say chocolate gives them an appetite the meaning of which may be that when they have a good appetite for their breakfast it is not unlikely it may continue all the day but i am of opinion it is a false and hysterical appetite such as sharp wines and sharp humors in the stomach give for fat and oily things such as all nuts are are hard to digest and lie long in the stomach for reasons i have already explained it may lubricate and sheath against the irritation of salt and sharp humors in the bowels and therefore may be good in the colicks and gravel of those of strong and stout digestion but can never be good food for those of weak nerves and poor constitutions nothing is so light and easy to the stomach most certainly as the farinaceous or mealy vegetables such as pease beans millet oats barley rye wheat sago rice potatoes and the like of some of which on milk or water i should ever advise the valetudinary and those of weak nerves to make their two lesser or secondary meals tobacco is another foreign weed much in use here in britain though not among the best yet among the middle and inferior ranks of the people for those of gross and phlegmatic constitutions who abound in serous and watery humors who are subject to coughs catarrhs and asthmatick indispositions who labor under violent toothachs or are troubled with rheums in their eyes who have cold and waterish stomachs and live fully and freely both smoking and chewing is a very beneficial evacuation drawing off superfluous humors crudities and cold phlegm provided they carefully avoid swallowing the smoke or the juice and drink nothing but rinse their mouths with some watery liquor after it and spit it out but to thin meagre and hectic constitutions it is highly pernicious and destructive heating their blood drying their solids and defrauding the food of that saliva which is so absolutely necessary toward concoction snuffing the leaves or the grosser cut in a morning will readily promote a flux of rheum by the glands of the nose and will be of good use to clear the head and the eyes but the ridiculous custom of perpetually sucking in sophisticated powders and other foreign drugs sold for snuff cannot but be prejudicial both to the eyes and even to the stomach at least if we believe the reports of those who say they have brought it up from thence      i have endeavored to assist the reader with some observations and reflections to enable him toward determining the quantity and quality of his solid food necessary either to prevent or cure chronical distempers it may not be amiss here to make some reflections also on the fit proportion of drink proper for that purpose as the food is so must that be various and uncertain with regard to the age size labor and constitution of the person and the season of the year i have offered to limit the quantity of strong liquors fittest to preserve health and lengthen out life in general to a pound or pint and that of the middling kind but the sickly the aged and those who would cure a chronical distemper must even abate of this quantity the only remaining question is about the quantity of water or watery liquors proper to be mixed with this strong liquor or drunk by itself for in this also though in itself harmless and innocent yet there is a choice and preference because too much water will only serve to distend and swell up the vessels and wash off some of the finer and more nutritious parts of the chyle and too little will not be sufficient to dilute the solid food or to make the chyle thin and fluid enough to circulate through the fine and small vessels i will suppose my patient to deal in no other cookery but roasting and boiling and that he eats only fresh meat boiling animal food draws more of the rank strong juices from it and leaves it less nutritive more diluted lighter and easier of digestion roasting on the other hand leaves it fuller of the strong nutritive juices harder to digest and wanting more dilution those therefore who must have full grown and adult animal food ought to eat it boiled and well boiled too if their digestion be but weak they who can live on young animal food which is best for weak stomachs ought to eat it roasted but must lessen the quantity in respect of the same food boiled but they must dilute it more for as roast meat has a better flavor and more nourishment so it lies less flabby on the stomach and does not so readily slip from or disappoint the action of grinding which has some share in digestions both primary and subsequent but it will want more dilution with a watery menstruum to soften its more rigid and crisp fibers if therefore the whole weight of the solid food in twenty four hours be supposed a pound and a half then three pounds of liquor that is one of strong liquor and two of some aqueous fluid will in a medium be sufficient to dilute it abundantly for thus there will be two particles of a fluid to one solid particle which abating the solid parts thrown off by siege will suffice to make the chyle abundantly thin to circulate through all the fine channels whose diameters are larger than that of the solid particle the principal end of its thinness and fluidity more than this would but distend the vessels and carry off the finer parts of the chyle by water or perspiration for we constantly find both these increased by an overdose of fluids and less would not sufficiently dilute their food i should advise those therefore who have weak stomachs or relaxed nerves to mix their wine with the abovenamed quantity of boiled water with a burnt crust at least bloodwarm and to drink it after their meal is over if they can do it with ease rather than in the time of eating for the more spirituous and most nourishing parts of the food will readily run off without much dilution and it will be the grosser and harder remaining part that will want it most and if some time after their great meal they find their stomach loaded the food rising hard belching heartburning or much yawning to swill down and dilute it with milkwarm light green tea or warm water rather than to run to drams and cordials the usual but most pernicious antidote in such cases and upon great and heavy oppression much trouble and great struggle in the digestion to have recourse to carduus or camomileflower tea to bring it up rather than to trespass in these poisonous and caustic liquors which though they may at present lessen the suffering and hurry on the firstconcoction yet make them dearly pay for it when the unconcocted load of crudities comes to pass by siege or perspiration either in colicks gripes vapors and oppression of spirits or by a general disability and rheumatick stitches and pains    0 upon the head of cordials mentioned in one of the foregoing articles i cannot forbear setting down one whose virtues and efficacy i have long tried and have never found it fail when any thing would succeed and i recommend it to be kept by them to all those who are liable to low spirits faintings oppressions sickness at the stomach headachs and vapors and also to those who wanting to exert themselves in any business of consequence need a flow of spirits for some short time for that purpose or indeed upon any sudden accident arising of its own accord out of the habit itself i think it a kind of an universal remedy but never to be used but upon such occasions because use may weaken it if not extinguish its virtue it is thus  take of simple chamomileflower water six ounces compound gentian and wormwood waters each an ounce and a half compound spirit of lavender sal volatile tincture of castor and gum ammoniack dissolved in some simple water each two drams tincture of snakeweed and tincture of the species diambrae each a dram the chemical oils of lavender juniper and nutmeg each ten drops mixed with a bit of the yolk of an egg to make the whole uniform assafetida and camphire in a rag each half a dram but these may be left out by those to whom they are disagreeable  two three or four spoonfuls of this is a present help in such cases it will keep six months good  general rules for health and long life drawn from the head of meat and drink   the great rule of eating and drinking for health is to adjust the quality and quantity of our food to our digestive powers the quality may be judged by the following rules   those substances that consist of the grossest parts are hardest of digestion the constituent particles coming into more contacts and consequently adhering more firmly   these substances whose parts are brought together with the greatest force cohere proportionably closer than those that come together with a smaller i e force momentum   salts are very hard to be separated because united by plain surfaces under which they are always comprehended and in the last stages of the circulation where it is slower shoot readily into larger clusters and so are harder to be driven out of the habit from these we may easily infer that   those vegetables and animals that come soonest to their full growth are easier of digestion than those that are longer of attaining the state of maturity   those that are the smallest of their kind than the biggest   those of a dry fleshy and fibrous substance than the oily fat and glutinous   those of a white substance than those of a more flaming color   those of a mild soft and sweet than those of a strong poignant aromatical or hot taste   landanimals than seaanimals   those animals that live on vegetables or other light food than those that live on other animals or hard and heavy food   the nourishment nature has appointed for young animals is lighter than the flesh of these animals themselves   all crammed poultry and stallfed cattle and even vegetables forced by hot beds tend more to putrefaction and consequently are more unfit for human food than those brought up in the natural manner   plaindressed food is easier of digestion than what is pickled salted baked smoaked or any way highseasoned   strong men those of large stature and much labor and the inhabitants of a cold and clear air require more food than women children the weak the sedentary and the aged and those that live in a warmer climate or grosser air   nothing conduces more to health and long life than abstinence and plain food with due labor   where exercise is wanting as in studious persons there is the greater need of abstinence for these   ounces of animal and    of vegetable food in    hours is sufficient  0 most chronical diseases proceed from repletion as appears from their being cured by evacuation    tender persons ought to use as much abstinence as they possibly can and if they neglect it their only relief is from frequent stomachick and familypurges    a plain rule for judging of the quantity is not to eat so much as indisposes for business    a more sensible and readier one is first by experience to find out how much fits one so as to be lightsome and healthy under it and ever after to judge the quantity by the eye nature requiring therein no mathematical exactness    pork and fish are not fit food for the studious and the tender    water is the most natural and wholesome of all drinks quickens the appetite and strengthens the digestion most    strong and spirituous liquors freely indulged become a certain though a slow poison    there is no danger in leaving them off all at once the plea for continuing them being false and groundless    the best strong liquor for weak and studious people is wine the best quantity a pint in    hours and the best way of drinking it is three glasses with and three without water    the middling light wines fully ripe and of a due age are preferable to the strong wines  0 strong liquors do not prevent the mischiefs of a surfeit nor carry it off so safely as water though they seem to give present relief    the frequent use of spirits in drams and cordials is so far from curing lowspiritedness that it increases it and brings on more fatal disorders    and even when they are diluted with water in punch the quantity taken down at once and the addition of a corroding acid produce equally pernicious effects in human constitutions    malt liquors excepting clear small beer of a due age are extremely hurtful to tender and studious persons    coffee is only an infusion of a kind of calx and has the effects of an absorbent medicine and so may be of some service to watery stomachs if moderately used    green tea is a good diluter of the food as it is an agreeable warm small liquor but bohea is too heavy for the stomach    chocolate as all nuts else is so heavy and hard of digestion that it can never be fit for the stomachs of weak and tender people    smoking tobacco without drinking after it chewing or snuffing the gross cut leaf in a morning are useful to phlegmatic constitutions but to dry and lean habits they are pernicious snuff is just good for nothing at all    the proper quantity of watery liquors in    hours to those that live regularly is two pints as that of strong liquor is one pint which is best drank warm and rather after than in the time of eating    the form of a cordial fit to be kept in private families as a present and certian relief for sudden qualms faintness sickness or low spirits but never to be taken but in case of necessity chap iii of sleeping and watching    the next general head in order is our sleeping and watching all bodies by their actions upon one another and by the action of the circumambient bodies are liable to be impaired and wasted and all animal bodies from an active and selfmoving principle within them as well as from the rubs of bodies without them are constantly throwing off some of their superfluous and decayed parts so that animal bodies are in a perpetual flux to restore this decay and wasting of animal bodies nature has wisely made alternate periods of labor and rest sleeping and watching necessary to our being the one for the active employments of life to provide for and take in the materials of our nourishment the other to apply those materials to the proper wasted parts and to supply the expenses of living and it seems as improper in the order of nature to disturb the animal functions in the time of sleep by any other employment than that of the secondary concoctions as they are called i e the applying the nourishment to the decayed parts to recruit the blood perfect the secretions and to lay up plenty of spirits or to speak more philosophically to restore the weakened tone of nervous fibers that is in short to restore the decays of watching and action this i say is as improper as it would be were it possible to eat or drink or make provision for the necessities of life in the time of sleeping from hence is evident the absurdity of heavy various and luxurious suppers or of going to rest till many hours after such a meal which must otherwise break in upon the order of nature and the due and appointed times of sleeping and watching wherefore i advise the valetudinary the studious and the contemplative either to make no suppers or only of vegetable food and to take a due time for watching after them     there is nothing more certain than that abstracting from acute cases our sleep is sound sweet and refreshing according as the alimentary organs are easy quiet and clean if any one not suffering under any disease is disturbed in his sleep it is certain his stomach is filled with food or crudities or his guts filled with wind choler or superfluous chyle and those restless nights and the difficulty of going to sleep which are generally ascribed to vapors are entirely owing to these causes though they be not so strong as to become sensible for then pain is added to watching and they are felt and upon complaints of such restless nights i never once failed upon enquiry of finding the true cause in the diet of the preceding day or of some few days before and constantly have discovered that some error in eating and drinking either in quantity or quality has produced them i have been astonished to see hypochondriacal and hysterical people restless all night tossing and tumbling till toward morning then dropping asleep till late hours awake heavy oppressed and unrefreshed complain of being hagridden tired and wearied as if they had been whipped spurred lashed and beaten through all the watches of the night rise with foul mouths and white tongue belchings yawnings coughing spitting or reaching and heaving without appetite spirits or life all the daytime begin to live and breath become cheerful and hungry about ten eleven or twelve a clock at night eat a hearty various and luxurious supper drink a cheeruping cup of the best become as merry as crickets and long to sit up later at last tumble to bed and repeat the same farce over again the reason of all this complaint is the load on the stomach that will not suffer them to rest till it is got off the sharp and crude humors twitching and twinging the nervous fibers and coats of the bowels become like so many needles and pins constantly running through them though not always with sensible pain the unconcocted chyle stopping or circulating slowly first in the bowels then in the smallest vessels begets these convulsions flatus nightmares and oppressions of spirits so that the secondary digestions are not over till next evening hence their want of appetite and when these are finished their stomachs come and their spirits flow and thus the perpetual round is carried on did they but follow the dictates of nature go to bed for some days with a light vegetable or no supper at all and bear the inconveniences thence arising their appetites would come in due season and they would quickly find the truth of the aphorism of the schola salernitana  i e that your sleep may be sweet let your supper be light somnus ut sit levis sit tibi canoe brevis    the seasons for sleeping and watching which nature seems to point out to us at least in these our climates near the tropic are the vicissitudes of day and night those damps vapors and exhalations that are drawn up into the higher regions and are so rarefied by the heat and action of the sun as to become innocent or very weak in the daytime are condensed sink low near the surface of the earth and are perpetually dropping down in the night season and consequently must be injurious to those tender persons that unnaturally watch in that season and must necessarily obstruct the perspiration which the activity of watching and the motion of labor promotes i have already shown that our bodies suck and draw into them the good or bad qualities of the circumambient air through the mouths of all the perspiratory ducts of the skin and if we were to view an animal body with a proper glass it would appear with an atmosphere quite round it like the steam of a boiling pot now we may easily conceive what injury a constitution may receive not only by stopping such a perpetual discharge of superfluities but also by forceing into the habit by the airs weight and pressure those noxious fumes and vapors that are perpetually falling near the surface of the earth in the nighttime your true topers are so sensible of this that by observation they have gathered it to be more safe for their health and better for prolonging their lives to get drunk betimes and go to bed than to sit up and be sober     on the contrary the heat of the sun in the daytime by its action on human bodies the very light and free air and the motions of things about us disturbing the quiet of the air must necessarily disorder the equable course of the perspiration the tenor of the secondary concoctions and the tranquillity of the spirits so necessary to rest and quiet so that nothing seems more directly pointed out to us by nature than the day for labor and the night for rest and this without taking in the consideration of the necessity of the suns light for the ends of labor and providing the necessaries of life some animals that are exceeding tender are directed by nature to alternate periods of watching and rest not twice in    hours but twice in the year viz summer and winter such as swallows bats and many sorts of insects who sleep all the winter and watch all the summer so consistent is nature in appointing the brightest and most enlightened parts of our lives for action and the darkest and most inclement for rest not but that robust constitutions as well as animals fitted by nature for different ways of living may by custom get the better of these natural appointments but i write for the valetudinary the studious and the contemplative     i advise all such if they would preserve their health and lengthen out their days to avoid as much as is possible evening dews nocturnal studies and unseasonable watching in summer to go to bed with the sun and in winter to rise at least by break of day those who live temperately will necessarily sleep but little but to recompense that their sleep will be much more sound refreshing and fruitful of cheerfulness and free spirits than that of those who live more freely for as i have before said the quantity of sleep will always be in proportion to the quantity of eating and drinking valetudinary studious and contemplative people ought to go to bed by eight nine or ten at farthest and rise by four five or six by which they will have eight hours a bed and that is sufficient for any person not under an acute or the sharp fits of a chronical distemper     nothing can be more prejudicial to tender constitutions studious and contemplative persons than lying long a bed or lolling and soaking in sheets any time after one is distinctly awake or has slept a due and reasonable time it necessarily thickens the juices enervates the solids and weakens the constitution a free open air is a kind of a cold bath especially after rising out of a warm bed and consequently makes the circulation brisker and more complete and braces up the solids which lying a bed dissolves and soaks in moisture the erect posture and the activity of watching make the perspiration more plentiful and the gross evacuations more readily thrown off this is evident from the appetite and hunger those that rise early feel beyond that which they get by lying long a bed add to all these the influence of the fresh benign morning air the retreating of all the noxious damps and vapors of the night together with the clouds and heaviness that are thrown upon the brain from sleep and lastly that cheerfulness and alacrity that is felt by the approach or presence of that glorious luminary the sun which adds a new force to the heart and a spur to the spirits     all nations and ages have agreed that the morning season is the proper time for speculative studies and those employments that most require the faculties of the mind for then the stock of the spirits is undiminished and in its greatest plenty the head is clear and serene the passions are quieted and forgot the anxiety and inquietude that the digestions beget in the nervous system in most tender constitutions and the hurry the spirits are under after the great meal are settled and wrought off i should advise therefore those who are of a weak relaxed state of nerves who are subject to hypochondraical or hysterical disorders whose professions lead them to much use of their intellectual faculties or who would indulge speculative studies to go early to bed and to rise betimes to employ their morning hours in these exercises till eleven a clock then to take some agreeable breakfast of vegetable food to go on with their studies and professions till three four or five as their spirits will hold out and then to take their great meal of animal food all the rest of the day to throw off all study and thought divert themselves agreeably in some innocent amusement with some gentle bodily exercise and as soon as the digestion is over to retire and provide for going to bed without any farther supplies except it be a glass of fair water or warm sackwhey but the aged and sickly must go sooner to bed and lie longer because age and sickness break rest and the stiffend and hardened limbs of the ancient become more pliant and relaxed by much sleep a supine posture and the warmth of the bed  rules for health and long life drawn from the head of sleep and watching   the valetudinary the sedentary and the studious should eat very light or no supper if any it ought to be vegetable food neither ought they to go soon to bed after any supper whatsoever   going to bed on a full stomach and wind and crudities somewhere in the in the alimentary passages is the cause of the want of due rest which is sound and refreshing always in proportion to the emptiness and cleanness of these passages and their vacation from their proper office of digestion and this is the cause of the want of kindly and refreshing rest in hypochondriacal and hysterical people   watching by night and sleeping by day is of the most pernicious consequence to health and long life and plainly contrary to the indications of nature and the constitutions of our bodies   the valetudinary sedentary and studious ought carefully to avoid evening dews nocturnal studies and unseasonable watching go to bed by eight nine or ten and rise proportionably by four five or six unless actually under a fit of sickness   nothing is more prejudicial to tender constitutions than lying long a bed indulging a lethargical and drowsy sleep or lolling or loitering awake as appears by their heaviness and want of appetite upon doing so and their good stomachs cheerfullness and freedom of spirits when they rise early   the most advantageous manner for the tender sedentary and studious to bestow their time on account both of their health and studies is to go early to bed rise betimes go about their studies till eleven taking a light vegetable breakfast prosecute them till about four in the afternoon then to take their great meal of animal food and after that to employ the rest of their time in some innocent amusement or gentle bodily exercise to retire betimes to prepare for going to bed taking no farther nourishment except a draught of water or warm sackwhey which will be particularly useful to those who labor under stone and gravel chap iv of exercise and quiet    we proceed in the next place to the consideration of exercise and quiet the due regulation of which is almost as necessary to health and long life as food itself whether we were so made before the fall as to live in entire health in a rigidly sedentary and contemplative life is a speculation of no great consequence nor easily determined in our present situation for there is no certain analogy between things as they now are and as they might have been then as there happened an entire revolution in the complexion and qualities of the minds of the first pair so to me there appear to be evident indications of a designed change and alteration of the material world and the nature of the animals and vegetables which subsist on this globe from what they were when god pronounced every thing good that he had made nor seem the celestial bodies to have escaped so far as they regard us whatever be in this the passage where god tells adam genesis chap iii v    that in the sweat of his brow he shall eat bread seems to be the injunction of a salutary penance that is not merely a punishment but also a remedy against the disorders his body would be liable to in this new state of the creation and against the poisonous effects of the forbidden tree he had eaten the fruit of i am the more confirmed in this belief that i observe the absolute necessity of labor and exercise to preserve the body any time in due plight to maintain health and lengthen out life for let whatsoever diet be pursued however adjusted both in quantity and quality let whatever evacuations be used to lessen the malady or any i e equivalent succedaneum be proposed to prevent the ill effects our bodies are so made and the animal economy now so contrived that without due labor and exercise the juices will thicken the joints will stiffen the nerves will relax and on these disorders chronical distempers and a crazy old age must ensue nor is this necessary only in the colder climates and where the food is gross but even in the warmest climates and where the food is lightest for though the warmth of the air may keep the perspiration free and open or rather where it is very great promote sweating yet at the same time and by consequence it will thicken the fluids and relax the fibers to prevent both which exercise is absolutely necessary but in such a climate it ought to be gone about in the cool of the day and though light food may in a great measure prevent the thickening of the fluids yet it cannot do it sufficiently without exercise nor can it at all keep the fibers in due tension for to that purpose exercise is absolutely necessary nay the joint power of warm air and light food cannot supply the place of exercise in keeping the joints pliant and moveable and preserving them from growing resty and stiff     i have sometimes also indulged a conjecture that animal food and made or artificial liquors in the original frame of our nature and design of our creation were not intended for human creatures they seem to me neither to have these strong and fit organs for digesting them at least such as birds and beasts of prey have who live on flesh nor naturally to have those voracious and brutish appetites that require animal food and strong liquors to satisfy them nor those cruel and hard hearts or those diabolical passions which could easily suffer them to tear and destroy their fellow creatures at least not in the first and early ages before every man had corrupted his way and god was forced to exterminate the whole race by an universal deluge and was also obliged that the globe of the earth might not from the long lives of its inhabitants become a hell and a habitation for incarnate devils to shorten their lives from  00 or  000 years to  0 he wisely foresaw that animal food and artificial liquors would naturally contribute toward this end and indulged or permitted the generation that was to plant the earth again after the flood the use of these for food knowing that though it would shorten the lives and plate a scourge of thorns for the backs of the lazy and voluptuous it would be cautiously avoided by those who knew it was their duty and happiness to keep their passions low and their appetites in subjection and this very era of the flood is that mentioned in holy writ for the indulgence of animal food and artificial liquors after the trial had been made how insufficient alone a vegetable diet which was the first food appointed for human kind immediately after their creation was in the long lives of men to restrain their wickedness and malice and after finding that nothing but shortning their duration could possibly prevent the evil it is true there is scarce a possibility of preventing the destroying of animal life as things are now constituted since insects breed and nestle in the very vegetables themselves and we scarce ever devour a plant or root wherein we do not destroy innumerable animalcules but besides what i have said of natures being quite altered and changed from what was originally intended there is a great difference between destroying and extinguishing an animal life which otherwise might subsist many years by choice and election to gratify our appetites and indulge concupiscence and the casual and unavoidable crushing of those who perhaps otherwise would die within the day or at most the year and obtain but an inferior kind of existence and life at best whatever be in this conjecture it is evident to those who understand the animal economy and the frame of human bodies together with the history both of those who have lived abstemiously and of those who have lived freely that indulging in flesh meats and strong liquors inflames the passions and shortens life begets chronical distempers and a decrepit age as the history of the life of cornaro manifests to a demonstration     of all the exercises that are or may be used for health such as walking riding a horseback or in a coach fencing dancing playing at billiards bowls or tennis digging working at a pump ringing a dumb bell etc walking is the most natural as it would be also the most useful if it did not spend too much of the spirits of the weakly riding is certainly the most manly the most healthy and the least laborious and expensive of spirits of any shaking the whole machine promoting an universal perspiration and secretion of all the fluids to which may be added the various changes of the air through which they so quickly pass every alteration of which becomes as it were a new bath and thereby variously twitching the nervous fibers to brace and contract them as the new scenes amuse the mind those who cannot ride must be carried in a coach or litter which is the best exercise for the lame and crazy and the only one proper for old and decrepit persons as well as those that are so young that they are not able to manage their own exercise the home exercises such as playing at tennis and billiards dancing fencing and the like ought to be followed only when the season forbids being abroad for being in the air contributes much toward the benefit of exercise it is beautiful to observe that earnest desire planted by nature in young persons to romp jump wrestle and run and constantly to be pursuing exercises and bodily diversions that require labor even till they are ready to drop down especially the healthier sort of them so that sitting or being confined seems to be the greatest punishment they can suffer and imprisoning them for some time will much more readily correct them than whipping this is a wise contrivance of nature for thereby their joints are rendered pliable and strong their blood continues sweet and proper for a full circulation their perspiration is free and their organs stretched out by due degrees to their proper extension     it is also very agreeable to observe how the several different organs of laboring men are strengthened and rendered brawny and nervous as they happen to be most employed in their several vocations let them be otherwise ever so small or weakly the legs thighs and feet of chairmen the arms and hands of watermen the backs and shoulders of porters grow thick strong and brawny by time it is certain that speaking strong and loud without overstraining will strengthen the voice and give force to the lungs our nails and hair the more they are cut and shaved the more they grow and we may promote any one evacuation so far as to weaken and starve all the rest using any organ frequently and forcibly brings blood and spirits into it and so makes it grow plump and brawny and if due pains were taken by the labor proper to them the organs of all the functions of the animal economy might be strengthened and kept in due plight     therefore to the asthmatick and those of weak lungs i should recommend talking much and loud even by themselves walking up an easy ascent and when any degree of weariness warns them to sit and rest till they are easy and then to return to their walking again and so to increase it every day till they are able to walk a reasonable distance in a reasonable time to those who have weak nerves and digestion and to those who are much troubled with headaches most of all which arise from the ill state of the stomach and bowels i should recommend riding on horseback as much as possibly they could in the clearest and driest air and to change the air daily if possible to those who are troubled with the stone or gravel to ride much over rough causeways in a coach to those that have rheumatick pains to play at billiards tennis or cricket till they sweat plentifully and then go immediately into a warm bed and drink liberally of some warm thin liquor with ten drops of spirit of sal ammoniac or hearts horn in each draught to encourage the sweating to those who have weak arms or hams playing two or three hours at tennis or at football every day to those who have weak backs or breasts ringing a bell or working at a pump walking through rough roads even to lassitude will soonest recover the use of their limbs to the gouty though riding on horseback or in a coach will best prevent the distemper but the studious and the contemplative the valetudinary and those of weak nerves if they aim at health and long life must make exercise a part of their religion as it is among some of the eastern nations with whom pilgrimages at stated times are an indispensible duty and where mechanical trades are learned and practiced by men of all ranks those who have their time in their own hands ought to have stated seasons for riding or walking in a good air as indispensable as those for going to dinner to bed or to church three hours for riding or two for walking the one hals before the great meal and the other before going to bed is the least that can be dispensed with as the first part begets an appetite the second helps on the digestion those who are not masters of their own time must take it when they can but to be sure they ought to let no opportunity of taking it slip     there are three conditions of exercise to make it the most beneficial that may be first that it be upon an empty stomach as indeed that is the proper time for all medicinal evacuations for thereby the now concocted cocta non cruda sunt evacuanda hippocrat crudities or those superstuities nature would be rid of and has fitted by going through the proper secretions for being ejected but cannot throw off without foreign assistance will be readiest discharged for on a full stomach exercise would be too tumultuous precipitate the secretions and throw off the sound juices with the corrupted humors secondly that it be not continued to downright lassitude depression of spirits or a melting sweat the first will wear out the organs the second spend the strength and the third will only do violence to the natural functions thirdly due care is to be had after exercise to retreat to a warm room and proper shelter from the injuries of the weather lest sucking into the wasted body the nitrous particles of the circumambient air they should inflame the blood and produce a rheumatism fever or cold i might add a fourth condition joining temperance to exercise otherwise the evil will be as broad one way as it is long the other for since exercise will create a greater appetite if it is indulged to the full the concoctive powers will be as unequal to the load as they were before but i pass that over having sufficiently treated this subject already     under this head of exercise i cannot forbear recommending coldbathing and i cannot sufficiently admire how it should ever have come into such disuse especially among christians when commanded by the greatest lawgiver that ever was under the direction of gods holy spirit to his chosen people and perpetuated to us in the immersion at baptism by the same spirit who with infinite wisdom in this as in every thing else that regards the temporal and eternal felicity of his creatures combines their duty with their eternal happiness first the necessity of a free perspiration to the preservation of health is now known to every body and frequent washing the body in water cleanses the mouths of the perspiratory ducts from that glutinous foulness that is continually falling upon them from their own condensed dewy atmosphere whereby the perspiration would be soon obstructed and the party languish secondly the having the circulation full free and open through all the capillary arteries is of great benefit toward health and long life now nothing promotes that so much as coldbathing for by the violent and sudden shock it gives to the whole system of the fluids from the circumference inward toward the center and the fluids because reaction is always equal and contrary to action springing back again from the center to the circumference a force is raised almost ever sufficient to break through all the dams and obstructions of the smallest vessels where they mostly happen and to carry the circulation quite round thirdly nothing is so injurious and so much prevents the benefit of exercise to weak and tender constitutions as sucking into their bodies the nitrous and humid particles of the air that is catching of cold now nothing so effectually prevents this as coldbathing as the nature of the thing shows and experience confirms for if exercise to attenuate the juices and strengthen the solids be added to coldbathing a new spring and force will be given to the blood both to drive out these foreign and noxious mixtures and to unite the cuticular scales which form the scarfskin so as to strengthen it for the future against such violent entries     i should advise therefore every one who can afford it as regularly to have a cold bath at their house to wash their bodies in as a basin to wash their hands and constantly two or three times a week summer and winter to go into it and those that cannot afford such convenience as often as they can to go into a river or living pond to wash their bodies but this ought never to be done under the actual fits of a chronical distemper with a quick pulse headache weak lungs or a foul stomach nor ought they to stay in till they are overchilld and in winter they ought to pursue their exercises immediately after they come out and those of tender nerves ought to pour basins of cold water on their head or wash it well with a dripping sponge before they go in i cannot approve the precipitant way of jumping in or throwing the head foremost into a cold bath it gives too violent a shock to nature and risques too much the bursting some of the smaller vessels the natural way is holding by the rope to walk down the steps as fast as one can and when got to the bottom bending their hams as women do when they curtsy low to shorten their length so as to bring their heads a good way under water and then popping up again to take breath and thus alternately for two or three times and out again rubbing and currying well before they are dressed and this brings me to say something of another kind of exercise     the flesh brush is an exercise most useful for promoting a full and free perspiration and circulation almost every body knows what well currying will do to horses in making them sleek and gay lively and active even so much as to be worth half the feeding this it can no otherwise effectuate than by assisting nature to throw off by perspiration the i e the grosser parts recrements of the juices which stop the full and free circulation and by constant friction irritation and stimulation to allicite blood and spirits to the parts most distant from the seat of heat and motion and so to plump up the superficial muscles the same effect it would produce in other animals even human creatures themselves if they were managed in the same manner with the same care and regularity i should think it therefore well worth the pains of persons of weak nerves and sedentary lives especially those threatened with paralytick disorders to supply the want of exercise of other kinds with spending half an hour morning and night in currying and rubbing their whole body more especially their limbs with a flesh brush and it is a wonder to me that luxury has not brought coldbathing and currying in use upon the animals especially those of them upon whom they can be so readily made use of such as oxen pigs veal lamb and all poultry which naturally delight in coldbathing which are brought to the table for certain it is that cleanness and due exercise of which currying is one part would much contribute to make all animals whatsoever without exception healthier in themselves fuller of juice and spirits and consequently better food for human creatures  as to quiet the conditions of exercise being determined there needs nothing to be said of it rules for health and long life drawn from the head of exercise and quiet   whatever was the original constitution of man in our present state a due degree of exercise is indispensably necessary toward health and long life   animal food and strong liquors seem not to have been designed for man in his original make and frame but rather indulged to shorten the antidiluvian length of life in order to prevent the excessive growth of wickedness   walking is the most natural and effectual exercise did it not spend the spirits of the tender too much riding a horseback is less laborious and more effectual for such riding in a coach is only for the infirm and young children house exercises are never to be allowed but when the weather or some bodily infirmity will not permit going abroad for air contributes mightily to the benefit of exercise children naturally love all kinds of exercise which wonderfully promotes their health increases their strength and stretches out their organs   the organs of the body that are most used always become strongest and therefore we may strengthen any weak organ by exercise   the lungs are fortified by loud talking and walking up an easy ascent the digestion and the nerves are strengthened and most headaches cured by riding the stone and gravel eased by riding in a coach over rough ground rheumatick pains by playing at tennis billiards etc till one sweat and then going to a warm bed to promote the sweating feeble arms by playing at shittlecock or tennis weak hams by football and weak backs by ringing or pumping the gouty best recover the use of their limbs by walking in rough roads but prevent the fits best by riding a horseback or in a coach the valetudinary and the studious ought to have stated times for exercise at least two or three hours a day the one half before dinner the other before going to bed   exercise   should always be gone about with an empty stomach   should never be continued to weariness   after it one must take care not to catch cold and it should always be accompanied with temperance else instead of a remedy it will become an evil   coldbathing is of great advantage to health but should not be used under a fit of a chronical distemper with a quick pulse or with a headache or by those that have weak lungs it promotes perspiration inlarges the circulation and prevents the danger of catching cold those of tender nerves should pour water on their heads before they go in and none ought to jump in suddenly and with their heads foremost   the fleshbrush is a most useful exercise as appears by its advantage to horses and ought not only to be used on human bodies but also on such of the animals we design for our food as it can be applied to chap v of our evacuations and their obstructions   the three principal evacuations are by siege by water and by perspiration all these must be duly regulated and in the order of nature toward the preservation of health and the prolonging of life the first ought to be of a due consistence between both extremes i e the gross evacuations ought to be of such a consistence in the healthy as to take the impression of the guts oportet sanorum seeds esse figuratas those who are costive have either overheated their bodies with strong liquors have eaten too sparingly have too slow a digestion or the peristaltick motion of their guts are too weak whereby the food staying too long a time before the mouths of the lacteals is overdrained of its moisture those who have purging stools have eat too much or of things too strong for their concoctive powers for superfluous nourishment leaves too much chyle in the i e the food after it is drained of its nutritious parts faeces which fermenting in the guts stimulates them so as to become a purge i have often observed that a full meal of strong meat as fish beef pork baked meat or made dishes in tender persons goes off with the hurry and irritation of a purge leaving the bowels inflated colicked or griped and the spirits sunk to the last degree the food by its various mixture weight and fermentation stimulating all along from the stomach to the rectum and being scarce ever drained of its chyle without affording any nourishment to the body runs off thus crudely and becomes equal to a total abstinence from food for a long time and hence we have a most infallible rule i e after the trial has been made a posteriori to judge if we have governed ourselves in our diet in proportion to the necessities of nature and the forces of our concoctive powers this is the very reason why the bark overdosed and given to persons of weak digestion so constantly purges them and why mercury given either inwardly or by friction runs off in violent purging and cannot be raised into a salivation to wit the not adjusting the doses to the strength of the stomach and nervous fibers for the bark naturally binds and mercury naturally rises to the most pervious glands and in this sense i myself have frequently observed in weak and scrofulous bowels even diascordium and venice treacle to purge whereas had the doses been duly proportioned or had they begun by underdosing and taken a little longer time their end might have been effectually answered as i have often experienced without ever failing     and here it may not be amiss to take notice of a fatal mistake those run into who being weakly thin and slender aim by all means and at any price to become plump and round and in order to attain this are perpetually devouring huge quantities of high strong food and swallowing proportionable measures of generous liquors not knowing that by this very method they promote and confirm the disease they would remedy for in such persons and cases the globular part of the blood is constantly of a small quantity and very glewy and the serous part thin and watery that is the blood is poor and weak and the solids or nerves are loose and relaxed and the concoctive powers being in proportion to these two of consequence the digestions must be weak and imperfect and their force unable to dissolve and break any quantity of such strong meat or spirituous liquors into a proper chyle for nourishment and this great load must either be hurried off entirely through the alimentary ducts in supernumerary discharges or the small portion of chyle drawn out of it being too gross to unite and make a similar fluid with the mass of the blood must be precipitated through the other drains of the body and thus the poor thin creature must starve in luxury and waste amidst superfluity the case is the same with nurses and parents in rearing up young children the perpetual gripes colicks loosenesses hard bellies choakings wind and convulsive fits which torment half the children of england are entirely owing to the too great quantities of too strong food and too rank milk thrust down their throats by their overlaying mothers and nurses for what else do their slimy their gray or chylous their blackish and choleric discharges the noise and motion in their bowels their wind and choakings imply but crudities from superfluous nourishment this is so certain that they are universally and infallibly cured by testaceous powders which only absorb sharp crudities by rhubarb purges which at once evacuate and strengthen the bowels and by milk clysters issues and blisters which are still upon the foot of evacuation by obstinately persisting in these and the like intended to evacuate and strengthen the alimentary passages and a thin spare and nutritive diet nothing nourishes but food duly concocted and in the course of nature we must first plump up and extend and then harden and strengthen this is the way of nature in vegetation and thus the animal creation devoid of reason rear up their young and thus even the skilful groom treats his wasted and decayed horse and which is wonderful you shall find a sagacious horsedoctor plump up and fatten a rotten lean brokenwinded jade and make him look sleek gay and lively so as to cheat not only the esquire but his brotherdoctor in fewer weeks than all the mandoctors in england could rear up their fellow creature in years it is true the juices of men are more variously and more thoroughly corrupted and their solids entirely broken which never happens to the brutecreation but the greatest mistake lies in the neglect of duly observing and religiously prosecuting a proper regimen this must principally consist in a diet of soft light tender cool and mucilaginous foods or such as are already become chyle either by nature or art such are milk and milkmeats rice sago barley wheat eggs broths light soops jellies white young tender and wellfed poultry or butchery meat eaten little at a time and often never without an appetite nor to satiety joining to these the other helps and assistances mentioned in this treatise when flesh is once come it is easy to make it strong and hardy by due exercise and a gradual adventuring upon higher foods and more generous liquors     i have often heard valetudinary and tender persons and those of sedentary lives and learned professions complain of headaches sicknesses at the stomach colicks and gripes lowness of spirits wind and vapors and yet pretend they were very moderate and abstemious in their eating and drinking but upon enquiry i constantly found these very persons pursued with purging stools which was an evident proof to me that they had taken down more than they wanted or could digest for it is universally certain that those that do not exceed must have either costive or at least stools of a middle consistence there is nothing more ridiculous than to see tender hysterical and vapourish people perpetually complaining and yet perpetually cramming crying out they are ready to sink into the ground and faint away and yet gobbling down the richest and strongest food and highest cordials to oppress and overlay them quite fresh and generous food mixing with the sharp humors of the stomach and bowels may for some short time qualify and abate their irritation and may give a fillip to the sluggish circulation and become as it were a cork to stop the perpetual fuming up of these noxious steams upon the head and brain but this is pardon the similitude as if one should go to quench the pestilential steams of a commonshore by throwing in greater heaps of ordure and nuisance into it the proper remedy in this case is first to cleanse the fetid abyss and then to preserve it clean by cutting off all the inlets of putrefaction this will require a little courage labor and pain but the future ease and sweetness will more than abundantly recompense them for there is nothing more certain than that of those born sound here in england the headaches stomachaches colicks and nervous pains and disorders universally proceed from idleness and fullness of bread     those who eat but one moderate flesh meal a day will have regularly once a day a discharge of the remains of their food and generally speaking those that go oftener have exceeded some how those who pretend to cure themselves of nervous disorders or any other chronical diseases or preserve themselves from them or lengthen out their days must underdose themselves and therefore can go but once in two days even though they should undergo the pain of costiveness for it is impossible the nerves of those who have slippery bowels should ever be braced or wound up for there the cure must begin where the evil began and must be communicated thence to the rest of the system as a ropemaker begins the twist at one end of the rope and communicates it to all the other parts our access to the nerves of the stomach and bowels is obvious and open to the rest the way is difficult and far about and since a relaxation weakness and want of spring in the fibers is the origin of all nervous distempers no medicines but such as contract stiffen wind up and shorten them can remedy this evil and they must necessarily contract and bind up the fibers of the stomach and guts as the parts they first approach and exert their virtue upon and he who without firm bowels thinks to cure a nervous distemper labors as much in vain as he who would keep a fiddlestring soaking in oil and water to make it vibrate or play off a fine composition of music     by experience and observation i have found that in those who have one regular discharge in twentyfour hours the time of the progress of the food from the stomach till its remains are thrown off is three natural days and in those who go but once in two days the time is six natural days the curious may be satisfied in this by swallowing an almond or any other nut which passes without being broken or making any irritation the reason is this that a smaller quantity of food is retained longer by their suction at the mouths of the lacteals to drain it entirely of its chyle and its weight being less the concoctive powers have the greater force upon it and so it is retained till it is perfectly digested and drained of all its humidity whereby such people become costive whereas in people that exceed the contrary causes precipitate the course of the aliment and so leave the bowels always slippery and nothing can more demonstratively show an excess than the lubricity of the discharge and i have often observed in tender persons and those of weak nerves when a meal i mean only of those who eat flesh meat only once a day has been a little too hard for the stomach though the spirits have been full and free and the health equal and good by duly proportioned meals for two preceding days the third day when the gross meal came off they have been full of wind and vapors their eyes dim and their heads heavy with flying rheumatick pains over the body and colickgripes from whence we may draw these three corollaries  coroll   it requires the same time for the unconcocted chyle of a gross meal to run the circle of the habit and the feculent remains to pass through the guts the first by perspiration and the last by siege  coroll   we may likewise gather from thence a confirmation of that aphorism of the physicians that the errors of the first concoction are never mended in the subsequent unless the case to be mentioned in the next paragraph be an exception to it for the gross meal gave rather more uneasiness when it came to be thrown off by perspiration  coroll   from hence we may also see the ridiculousness of the vulgar opinion ascribing universally the pain they suffer or the relief they find to the last meal or medicine     there are some sorts of food which may oppress and load the stomach and alimentary ducts in the first concoction which may be very safe and benign in the subsequent ones for instance cheese eggs milkmeats and vegetable food though duly prepared and justly proportioned in quantity may chance to lie heavy on the stomach or beget wind in the alimentary passages of some persons and yet drinking of water will always remedy this inconveniency but these neither having their parts strongly united nor abounding in sharp urinous salts when they become sufficiently diluted with a watery menstruum or dissolved into their component parts and their parts being still smaller than the smallest vessels and their union constantly less than the force of the concoctive powers in persons who have any remaining fund of life in them will thereby yield a sweet thin and easily circulating chyle in the after concoctions become benign and salutary and afford no materials for chronical distempers and the wind thence generated not being pointed and armed with such sharp salts as those of flesh meats or the corrosive juices of spirituous liquors will be as innocent and safe as the element we breathe in     the second evacuation is by water whose circumstances and condition though little adverted to may be of great service to discover both the state of our constitution and the proportion of our diet some people are frightened when they find their water turbid broken and full of brickdust sediment whereas that is the best symptom it can have for though it supposes the blood loaded with urinous salts and cradities yet it is still better they should pass off than continue in the habit on the contrary when those that live freely have quantities of pale limpid and sweet water it is a certain sign that the perspiration is stopped that neither the first nor the secondary concoctions have been duly performed that the chyle has not been sufficiently broken nor the finer secretions duly made by the lesser drains and that the urinous salts are still retained in the habit upon which must needs ensue oppression of spirits chills upon the extremities flying rheumatick pains over the body headaches cholicks and gripes and here it may not be amiss to take notice of the difference of the pale water of hypochondriacal and hysterical persons from that of those who labor under a true diabetes the apprehension of which terrifies so often the low and dispirited persons of the first class the water of both has the same appearance both in quality and quantity at least in the first instance they are both attended with the same sinking and dispiritedness but in a true diabetes there is a constant thirst a low but quick pulse the water is much sweeter and continues longer to come off in profuse quantities insomuch that sometimes it is so violent as to run down the party in a few days in hypochondriacal and hysterical persons there is little or no thirst never a quick pulse but rather too low and slow a one the flux soon stops of itself or by any little diaphoretick medicine and they are cold upon the extremities which the others are not     that bluish and variegated film which sometimes looks like oil and fat swimming on the water of scorbutic and cachectick persons is nothing but the congregated salts which are crowded so thick together that they are ready to shoot into clusters much like the film of a i e a lie lixivium when standing for the crystallization of fixed salts the water which has a light cloud hanging almost from the top to the bottom is of a bright amber color and about three quarters of the liquor taken down is best and a certain sign of a due concoction a just proportion of food and a total absence of repletion and crudity and those who live temperately use due exercise and enjoy a perfect state of health always make such water     those who are subject to great quantities of limpid and pale water ought to conclude that their food has been too heavy in quality or too much in quantity for their concoctive powers or their labor too little and that therefore they ought to proportion both for the future with more caution and exactness by living low for some time or using more exercise and to stop their flux of pale water they ought to take a little gascoigns powder confection of alkermes or sir walter raleighs cordial at night and drink liberally of small warm sack whey with a few drops of spirit of hartshorn to set the perspiration in order again those on the other hand who make highcolourd foul and very turbid water in smaller quantities have either inflamed their blood too much with spirituous liquors or loaded it with too great a quantity of animal salts to prevent therefore disorders and diseases they must lessen the quantity of their flesh meat and temper the heat of their wine with water else they will lay the foundation of some acute inflammatory or dangerous chronical distemper    0 the worst kind of water of all is that of a dark brown or dirty red in a small quantity and without any sediment this kind of water in acute diseases always indicates insuperable crudity high inflammation tending toward mortification and a dying languor in nature and in persons laboring under no visible distemper at the time an almost total debility of the concoctive powers an inseparable union of the constituent parts of the blood the highest degree of crudity and a deadness in all the animal functions and if preceded by long continued excesses requires the advice of a physician i shall say nothing of coffeecolourd bloody wheyish or purulent water or that with white gravel films rags or bits of broken membranes they are well known to be nephritick or symptoms of an ulcer somewhere in the urinary passages      there happens also an evacuation both by siege and urine to some weak persons of relaxed nerves that extremely alarms the patient and is not so readily accounted for in common that part of physic which teaches the causes of diseases aetiology it is when either a white transparent viscid substance like gelly is constantly voided by the bowels more or less or when a white milk glewy substance like cream or laudable matter settles in the water both these appearances are commonly ascribed to an ulcer in the guts or in the kidneys the very apprehension of which is almost sufficient in some low persons to bring on the distemper feared and yet i am very certain there is neither ulcer nor true matter in either case as i propose them for where there is violent and acute pain or matter of different colors or mixtures there very possibly may be nay certainly there is an ulcer but in the case i here intend there is very little or no pain no hectical paroxysms which always attend an inward ulcer no bloody or sanious mixtures which always betray the inward sore no fetid smell to imply corruption for the cases i put at present happen to persons the least capable of inflammation or imposthumation viz to paralytick persons or those of a natural tendency that way to cold vapourish persons of low spirits and weak nerves whose pulse is low and slow and their natural functions weak and languid all which evidently show that these discharges cannot come from an ulcer the first case i take to be either an obstruction of some of the lacteals whereby the chyle cannot be carried off in any sufficient quantity but passing through the guts and its more watery part being evaporated it becomes thick and gelatinous and is thrown off at last with the remains of the food else it must be an obstruction of those glands of the guts by which a viscid matter for lubricating of them is commonly secerned by the imprisonment and evaporation of which matter it thickens and turns like a gelly as it does by cold or overfeeding in the glands of the mouth throat and windpipe and at last by the squeezing of the guts is thrown off and in the same manner i take that milky substance subsiding in the water in such a case as i have mentioned to arise from a relaxation of the glands of the kidneys and bladder and other urinary passages and that both are to be cured the same way other nervous distempers are cured viz by a proper regimen of diet and a course of contracting strengthening and volatile medicines      the insensible perspiration is the third evacuation to be considered the statical chair invented by sanctorius for examining the quantity of the perspiration however ingenious and delightful in speculation is too cumbersome and laborious to be of any great use in common life it is certain however that the free and full flowing of this evacuation is as necessary to health as any of the grosser since in quantity it is at least equal to both the forementioned and an obstruction thereof is generally the source of all acute diseases as it is a consequence of all chronical ones and therefore i have advised those who are much abroad in easterly and northerly winds which most of any obstruct perspiration and have fluxes of white and pale water to a ready antidote to prevent the beginnings of these obstructions      dr his statica britannica james keill has made it out beyond all possibility of doubting that catching of cold is nothing but sucking in by the passages of perspiration large quantities of moist air and nitrous salts which by thickening the blood and juices as is evident from bleeding after catching cold and thereby obstructing not only the perspiration but also all the other finer secretions raises immediately a small fever and a tumult in the whole animal economy and neglected lays a foundation for consumptions obstructions of the great viscera and universal cachexies the tender therefore and valetudinary ought cautiously to avoid all occasions of catching cold and if they have been so unfortunate as to get one to set about its cure immediately before it has taken too deep root in the habit from the nature of the disorder thus described the remedy is obvious to wit lying much abed drinking plentifully of small warm sack whey with a few drops of spirit of hartshorn posset drink water gruel or any other warm small liquors a scruple of gascoigns powder morning and night living low upon spoonmeats pudding and chicken and drinking every thing warm in a word treating it at first as a small fever with gentle diaphoreticks and afterward if any cough or spitting should remain which this method generally prevents by softening the breast with a little sugar candy and oil of sweet almonds or a solution of gum ammoniac an ounce to a quart of barley water to make the expectoration easy and going cautiously and well clothed into the air afterward this is a much more natural easy and effectual method than the practice by balsams linctuss pectorals and the like trumpery in common use which serve only to spoil the stomach oppress the spirits and hurt the constitution      the surest way of maintaining and promoting a due perspiration is to take down no more food than what the concoctive powers are sufficient to reduce into a due fluidity and the expenses of living require to prosecute necessary exercise and use the other assistances advised in the foregoing chapters want of due rest and the refreshment that follows upon it starting tossing and tumbling abed are certain signs that the perspiration is not duly carried on in the night season and therefore in order to remedy this a greater proportion of exercise a greater degree of abstinence or some gentle domestic purge must be had recourse to the next day colical pains gripes and purging much eructation and belching of wind low spiritedness yawning and stretching are infallible signs that the perspiration flows not freely and plentifully then and therefore the same remedies ought to be prosecuted as soon as an opportunity offers else the party will suffer at last wind as sanctorius observes and demonstrates is nothing but obstructed perspiration and yawning and stretching are but convulsions of the proper muscles and organs appointed by nature the one for pumping up wind from the bowels the other for pressing upon the excretory ducts in the skin to force out the sluggish perspirable matter and it is beautiful to observe how wisely nature has contrived the sposms cramps and convulsions of the proper organs to expel every noxious and extraneous body out of the habit thus coughing is a convulsion of the diaphragm and muscles of the breast to throw out viscid phlegm vomiting of the stomach assisted by the diaphragm and muscles of the abdomen to throw up its crudities and those of the bowels or to expel sand or stones from the kidneys the throws of laboring women are to bring off the burden sneezing is an effort of the proper muscles to eject some noxious particles from the organs of smelling shivering and stretching to assist perspiration and yawning to pump up noxious wind and even laughing itself is an effort of the muscles of the whole trunk to throw off something that its delicate membranes cannot bear and lastly hysterical fits and convulsions both in infants and persons come to maturity are but violent efforts struggles workings cramps and spasms of all the muscles of the whole body together to expel squeeze and press out the sharp acrimonious wind fumes and vapors from the cavities of the whole machine      there is an evacuation incident to persons of weak nerves which could not conveniently come in under the general division because it happens too seldom to make a new member of it it is a discharge of thin rheum from the glands of the mouth throat and stomach and is called by some a nervous or scorbutic spitting it rises sometimes to the height of a petit flux de bouche as the french call it and threatens some tender persons as they apprehend with a consumption though it imply nothing less we may observe some who are struck with a deep palsy to flow at the mouth and drivel down their breasts insomuch that the afflicted of this sort who are advanced in years can scarce speak intelligibly for the flux till they have first emptied and cleaned their mouths and this arises to so great a height in some much broken paralytick persons that upon the slightest occasions either of joy or grief they are apt to run into a profusion of tears sighs and sobbings and some sorts of idiots and those hysterically mopd and most of those who suffer from relaxed and weak nerves are more or less subject to these salival discharges especially after excesses in diet hence the first sort receive the appellation of snivellers or drivellers and the difficulty of the cure of all the diseases of weak nerves depends much on the quantity and constitution of this flux for much and long spitting and running off of this rheum implies a total relaxation of the whole nervous system and shows neither the first nor second concoctions have been duly performed i have frequently had occasion to show how excesses in the quantity or quality of the food in persons of relaxed and weak nerves begot a viscid and gross chyle of which that part which could not get through the lacteals lay fermenting and putrefying in the alimentary passages begot wind gripes and colicks and at last wrought itself off like a purge and that that part which got through the lacteals and was received within the limits of the circulation being too gross and glewy to be mixed with the old mass of the fluids to circulate through the smallest vessels and to enter the fine perspiratory glands would necessarily be thrown into the wider more spongy and loose salivary glands which are appointed by nature to secern the more glutinous parts of the fluids and from thence this salivary inundation proceeds the fact is when those of weak nerves commit habitual excesses in their diet the glands and small vessels of all the body are tumified swelled and obstructed thereby as they needs must be and it is from the pressure of these enlarged glands and the obstructed capillary vessels on the nerves and patent blood vessels that most of the evils they suffer under proceed but more especially are the glands appointed to draw off the more viscid serous part of the blood obstructed and tumified thereby upon which account as baglivi advises to enquire well into the state of the tongue and mouth in order to discover the condition of the stomach guts and bowels so i think it is highly reasonable in a chronical case to have great regard to the condition of the eyes and if a dead cold languor be observed in the hue or water of them as jewellers speak of diamonds and more especially if the lachrymal gland in the corner next the nose which i always narrowly inspect if i say this gland be found harder or larger than ordinary swelled and tumified it must certainly be concluded whatever else be in the case there must be a relaxed state of nerves much vapors weak natural functions and a mismanaged regimen and it is from the obstruction and swelling of this and the other glands in and about the eyes and their pressure upon the optical nerves and fine blood vessels that those spots flies atoms dimness darkness and confusion of sight in vapourish and hysterical people proceed for this gland shows that the whole serous glands in the upper regions of the body are in proportion tumified and swelled with viscid humors through excess of diet unless the person have suffered there by accident or labors under some natural disorders of the eyes from the obstruction and swelling of the salivary glands in the mouth throat and gullet proceed also those choakings gulping and strangling that hysteric persons so often complain of the wind and crudities lodged in their stomach and guts and the rest of the cavities of the body pressing to get vent upwards are resisted and stopped in their passage by the diaphragm whereby the inspiration is straightened and by the bulk of these glands throughout the gullet the way is entirely stopped which raises such a tumult and struggle as produces the mentioned symptoms which i have not leisure to detail here more minutely now this salivation or discharge of the thinner rheum and that coughing and hawking of more viscid phlegm commonly called a nervous cough as also the chincough of children and all such discharges of sharp serum in persons of weak and relaxed nerves is an effort of nature to relieve them and if discreetly managed and duly heeded would prove a crise to their disorders and quite free them from their present the sharpest part of the suffering fit of a disease paroxysms and set the circulation and perspiration and consequently the spirits at freedom and liberty again some persons most distractedly run to drams and cordials to remedy this evil to stop the violence of this deluge and to raise their drooping spirits but it serves only to thicken the phlegm shut up the mouths of the salivary glands closer and so to perpetuate the evil they mean to cure others devour large quantities of high and generous foods because they find a little relief to their spirits from the first run of the sweet thin and spirituous chyle but this is only adding fuel to the fire and running on in a perpetual round of lowness and slavering whereas would they suffer nature to act her own way to carry on this critical discharge as far as it will go without offering in the least either to check or promote it but by thin light food and cool liquors in moderate or rather under dosed quantities support her in the manner the concoctive powers are sufficient for after she had discharged all the crudities from the mass of the fluids by these emunctory glands and thereby given a free passage to the wind to escape the way it tends the salivation would lessen gradually and at last stop of itself and if then toward the decline a gentle vomit to pump up the slow and viscid remains of the wind and phlegm in the upper part of the alimentary passages and afterward a gentle stomachick warm purge to scour the lower part of these tubes were carefully administered the patient would soon find a clear head lightsome spirits ease and freedom from pain and oppression the circulation and perspiration would be soon brought to their natural and sound state and health and cheerfulness restored together unless a mortal or habitual spitting ptyalism was the case which i have sometimes observed as fatal and incurable as a true dropsy or inveterate diabetes all which owe their being to a deep scurvy whereby the globular part of the blood is entirely broken and the serum made a mere lixivium or lie  rules for health and long life drawn from the head of evacuation   costive stools are signs of overheated blood too spare feeding slowness of digestion or weakness of the guts   purging stools show intemperate feeding too full a meal has the effects of a purge fills the guts with wind and gives gripes mercury and even the bark diascordium and treacle if overdosed purge   headaches sick stomachs vapors low spirits gripes and colicks proceed from cramming and are ever accompanied with loose stools   those that live temperately have one regular stool a day those who have more exceed   the cure of all relaxations of the nerves the source of chronical diseases must necessarily begin at the stomach and guts   the time from eating a meal till its discharge is three days in those that have one stool a day six in those that have but one in two days   a gross meal produces more disorders the day the excrements of it go off than the day it is eaten   a meal takes the same time to get through the habit by perspiration that its remains do to pass through the guts   the errors of the first concoctions cannot be mended afterward  0 pain or relief is not always the effect of the last meal or medicine that was taken down    though cheese eggs milk and vegetable foods may be hard to digest without drinking of water to some stomachs yet their chyle is good and produces no bad effects    turbid water with brickdust sediment proceeds from the critical discharge of what was preternaturally retained in the habit    pale sweet water from the urinous salts being yet retained    there is great difference between hysteric pale water and that which proceeds from a diabetes    that appearance of fat on the urine of some people is nothing but a thin film of salts    bright ambercoloured water with a light sediment rising toward the top amounting to three quarters of what is drank is a sign of good digestion    great quantities of pale water proceed from excess in the quantity of food and want of exercise the cure of it is performed by eating less using more exercise and taking some diaphoreticks to set the perspiration right    highcolourd turbid water in small quantity shows abundance of animal salts in the habit or the immoderate use of spirituous liquors and must be cured by vegetable food and water or other small drink    dark brown water or of a dirty red is extremely dangerous both in acute cases and in those that seem at present to ail nothing  0 bloody purulent water and full of films is a sign of nephritick ailments stone and gravel    the viscid matter like gelly in the stools and the viscid milky substance somewhat like matter in the urine of some people of weak nerves proceed from a corruption of the liquor of the mucous glands of the intestines and of the bladder and other urinary passages    obstruction of perspiration is one source of acute diseases and a consequence of chronical ones    catching of cold is an obstruction of perspiration by the humid and nitrous particles of the air it should be cured by gentle diaphoreticks and not by balsamic pectorals which do no good but in the end of the cure to promote expectoration from the lungs if there be any occasion for it    persons of weak nerves have often a critical flux of rheum from the glands of the mouth and throat to a very large quantity which if not tampered with brings them great relief chap vi of the passions    i come now in the order of my first proposed method to treat of the passions which have a greater influence on health and long life than most people are aware of and that i may propose my scheme with the greatest clearness i can i will lay down some propositions or axioms as the groundwork on which it is founded  prop i the soul resides eminently in the brain where all the nervous fibers terminate inwardly like a musician by a welltuned instrument which has keys within on which it may play and without on which other persons and bodies may also play by the inward keys i understand those means by which the thoughts of the mind affect the body and by the outward those whereby the actions or sensations of the body affect the mind both these affections may be called passions in a general view as either part of the compound is acted upon  scholium as a man is compounded of two different principles soul and body and as there are two different kinds of outward objects by which these two different principles may be acted upon to wit matter and spirit the passions in these two different views may be divided into spiritual and animal as to the first branch of this division since spirits if i may be allowed there are any such beings may be supposed to act upon one another without the mediation of organical bodies such perhaps was st pauls ecstasy when he was rapt up into the third heavens such was mosess commerce with his maker when he spoke to god face to face such must the influence of the divine grace be supposed and all who allow of revelation admit that the soul may be serene and tranquil while the body is in distress and pain and even all the stoic philosophy is grounded on this distinction it must have a real existence in nature and the other branch must also be allowed by all those who cannot think brute animals mere machines and who observe that we have impressions made on our bodily organs which affect us sometimes very deeply even in our sleep however these things be it is sufficient for my purpose that man is allowed to be a compounded being on which outward objects may act to abstract the consideration of the impressions made on the spirit from those made on the body  prop ii the union of these two principles in the compound man seems to consist in laws praeestablishd by the author of nature in the communications between bodies and spirits as there are no doubt laws established for spirits in their commerce and actions upon one another for every one knows there are laws of nature established by its author for the actions of bodies upon one another  scholium these laws of the actions of the soul on the body and of the body upon the soul are never to be known to us but by their effects as the laws of nature in the actions of bodies upon one another were first discovered by experiment and afterward reduced into general propositions one law of the action of the soul on the body and vice versa seems to be that upon such and such motions produced in the musical instrument of the body such and such sensations should arise in the mind and on such and such actions of the soul such and such motions in the body should ensue much like a signal agreed to between two generals the one within the other without a citadel which should signify to one another what they have before agreed to and established between them or like the key of a cipher which readily explains the otherwise unintelligible writing besides these passions and affections which are involuntary  prop iii as bodies are purely passive and are acted upon by other bodies conformable to the settled laws of nature in spiritual beings on the contrary there is an active self motive selfdetermining principle by which it directs and manages itself with regard not only to its own self and its own sentiments but also to its actions and influence on other beings without it and their actions and influences on it and this is the foundation of liberty or freewill in rational and intelligent beings  scholium that this faculty or principle really exists and is essential to spiritual beings is as certain as that there is motion in the universe or that body and spirit are essentially different for that motion is not essential to bodies is as certain as that bodies are impenetrable and that the quantity of motion in the universe may be and is daily increased is as much demonstration as any proposition in euclid and if motion be is or may be increased it must arise from spiritual beings and he who can deny this only shows himself ignorant of the principles of all true and just philosophy and of the first elements of the system of material and spiritual beings for further conviction of this and clearing up all possible objections and difficulties i refer the reader to the learned and ingenious dr clarke in his answer to the enquiry into liberty and his letters to mr leibnitz where he has treated this matter with the greatest perspicuity and justness besides these now mentioned principles  prop iv as in bodies there is a principle of gravity or attraction whereby in vacuo they tend to one another and would unite according to certain laws and limitations established by the author of nature so there is an analogous principle in spirits whereby they would as certainly in their proper vacuity be attracted by tend to and unite with one another and their first author center and the rock out of which they were hewn to use a scripture phrase as the planets would to one another and to the sun and this is nothing else but what in scripture is called charity  scholium this proposition is as certain as the rules of analogy are which in my opinion are the foundation of all the knowledge we can have of nature while we can see only a few links of the universal chain and but a few disjointed parts of the grand system of the universe the author of nature who could create intelligent beings only in order to make them happy could not leave them to so many different attractions without implanting into their essence and substance as an antidote to such variety of distractions an infinite tendency bent and biass toward beings of the same nature and toward himself who was the cause and object of their felicity and even in this our lapsed and forlorn estate there remain evident footsteps of this principle yet uneffaced such are the checks of conscience natural affection and the universal desire of immortality and dread of annihilation what the world calls the seeds of honor and renown all that concern and regard paid mere romantic heroes and the worship bestowed by all nations who are not sunk into mere brutality on some superior and invisible powers these are remains of this principle and its workings sufficient to show its reality a posteriori as the laws of analogy and the nature and attributes of the first being show it a priori those who admit of revelation cannot doubt of it for a moment for deuteronomy xxx    moses calls it a law engraven on the heart of man and   cor xiii ult st paul the greatest perfection of human nature  coroll   hence the true nature of supreme spiritual good and evil may be discovered for if there be impressed on spiritual beings an infinite tendency bent and biass to be reunited with their divine original and the place in the divine substance out of which they were formed if i may speak so in a figurative sense then their being finally united with this their divine original is the supreme spiritual good and the several approaches toward this union are inferior spiritual goods as the being finally separated from it is the supreme spiritual evil and the several steps toward this separation inferior spiritual evils and the means of this union and separation are moral good and evil  coroll   by schol of prop   the most general division of the passions was into spiritual and animal as in the first sense passion may be defined the sentiments produced on the soul by external objects either spiritual ones immediately or material ones by the mediation of the organs of the body so in the second sense passion may be defined the effect produced by spirits or bodies immediately on the body and since outward objects may be considered as goods or evils the most natural division of the passions whether spiritual or animal as they regard these objects is into the pleasurable and the painful which exhausts their whole extent and in this sense all the passions may be reduced to love and hatred of which joy and sorrow hope and fear etc are but different modifications or complexions as they may be called i do not descend to a more particular account not intending an accurate treatise on the passions but only to lay a foundation for some general observations on them as they regard and influence health and long life     in relation to the organical instruments of the body and the effects wrought on them or the disorders brought upon them the passions may be divided into acute and chronical after the same manner and for the same reason as diseases are the acute passions whether pleasurable or painful have much the same effect and work much after the same manner as acute diseases do they effect a brisk and lively circulation of the fluids crisp up and constrict the solids for some short time thus sudden gusts of joy or grief pleasure or pain stimulate and spur the nervous fibers and the coats of the animal tubes and thereby give a celerity and brisker motion to their included fluids for the same time and the functions of the heart and lungs being involuntary they have their more immediate effects upon them thus both sudden joy and grief make us breath short and quick and make our pulse small and frequent the retaining our breath for some time for so far our breathing is voluntary to reflect more intensely upon the painful object forces at last a strong exspiration which becomes a sigh thus a sudden painful idea makes a quicker circulation of the blood and thereby throwing a greater quantity thereof upwards through the proportionally larger branch of the aorta makes it appear in the superficial vessels of the face neck and breast and so produces a blush which when longer continued and being very strong is dispersed over the whole surface of the body hence the observation of blushing at the back of ones hand and the reasons why we sigh upon some occasions and blush upon others depend upon the different structure of the organs of pulsation and respiration a quick surprising pain of mind acts upon the heart because the motion of the heart is altogether involuntary so that a sudden constriction takes place there immediately to increase the pulse whereas we have some power over the breathing we can stop or suspend it for a time and when we are thinking intensely our attention partly makes us hold our breath and hence ensues sighing rather than blushing for the pain being slow quickens the pulse more gradually but if it continues long both actions of both organs are respectively produced and hence it comes to pass that upon anxiety concern and earnest expectation the pulse is found quick and small and the breath thick and difficult as experience shows the same principles will account for the effects of fear and anger which make us change color and look red or pale as the blood is accelerated or retarded in its course the sudden gusts of these passions being thus accounted for when they become extreme they drive about the blood with such a hurricane that nature is overset like a mill by a flood so that what drove it only quicker round before now entirely stops it and renders the countenance pale and ghastly sudden and great fear or grief do so convulse the nervous system that sometimes they alter the position of the parts and fix them in a new one thus the hair stands on end in a fright and the whole system of the nerves becomes so rigid and stiff as to lose their elasticity whereby the animal functions are stopped at once and fainting and sometimes death ensues     the chronical passions like chronical diseases wear out waste and destroy the nervous system gradually those nerves which are necessary for considering brooding over and fixing such a set of ideas on the imagination being constantly employed are worn out broken and impaired the rest by disuse become resty and unactive lifeless and destitute of a sufficient flux of warm blood and due nourishment and thus the whole system languishes and runs into decay thus slow and long grief dark melancholy hopeless natural love and overweening pride which is an outrageous degree of selflove impair the habit by making the proper seasons of necessary food and due labor be neglected and thereby depriving the natural functions of their wonted supplies overworking some part of the nervous system and leaving the other to rust and become resty for want of use some of these passions as love grief and pride when very intense and long indulged terminate even in madness the reason is as i have been saying because long and constant habits of fixing one thing on the imagination begets a ready disposition in the nerves to produce again the same image till the thought of it become spontaneous and natural like breathing or the motion of the heart which the machine performs without the consent of the will and also a disability or immobility tetanus ensues on the other parts just as the faquiers in india fix one or both hands by long holding them up so as that they cannot bring them down again there is a kind of melancholy which is called religious because it is conversant about matters of religion although often the persons so distempered have little solid piety and this is merely a bodily disease produced by an ill habit or constitution wherein the nervous system is broken and disordered and the juices are become viscid and glewy this melancholy arises generally from a disgust or disrelish of worldly amusements and creature comforts whereupon the mind turns to religion for consolation and peace but as the person is in a very imperfect and unmortified state not duly instructed and disciplined and ignorant how to govern himself there ensues fluctuation and indocility scrupulosity horror and despair     since the mind resides as has been said in the common sensory like a skilful musician by a welltuned instrument if the organ be sound duly tempered and exactly adjusted answering and corresponding with the actions of the musician the music will be distinct agreeable and harmonious but if the organ be spoiled and broken neither duly tuned nor justly fitted up it will not answer the intention of the musician nor yield any distinct sound or true harmony those therefore who are tender and valetudinary lead sedentary lives or indulge contemplative studies ought to avoid excesses of the passions as they would excesses in high food or spirituous liquors if they have any regard to health to the preservation or integrity of their intellectual faculties or the bodily organs of them as the passions when slow and continued relax unbend and dissolve the nervous fibers so the sudden and violent ones screw up stretch and bend them whereby the blood and juices are hurried about with a violent impetuosity and all the secretions are either stopped by the constrictions cramps and convulsions begot by them or are precipitated crude and unconcocted and so beget or at least dispose toward inflammations fevers or mortifications hatred for example anger and malice are but degrees of a frenzy and a frenzy is one kind of a raging fever from all which it is plain the violent and sudden passions are more dangerous to health than the slow and continued as acute diseases are more destructive than chronical     to show yet farther the influence of the passions on the animal economy let us consider the different constitutions of men those who have very springy lively and elastick fibers have the quickest sensations a weaker impulse producing a stronger sensation in them these generally excel in the animal faculty of imagination hence the poet  poets are soon provoked genus irritabile vatum and therefore your men of imagination are generally given to sensual pleasure because the objects of sense yield them a more delicate touch and a livelier sensation than they do others but if they happen to live so long which is hardly possible in the decline of life they pay dearly for the greater bodily pleasures they enjoyed in the youthful days of their vanity those of rigid stiff and unyielding fibers have less vivid sensations because it requires a greater degree of force to overcome a greater resistance those excel most in the labors of the understanding or the intellectual faculties retain their impressions longest and pursue them farthest and are most susceptible of the slow and lasting passions which secretly consume them as chronical diseases do and lastly those whose organs of sensation are if i may speak so unelastick or entirely callous resty for want of exercise or any way obstructed or naturally illformed as they have scarce any passions at all or any lively sensations and are incapable of lasting impressions so they enjoy the firmest health and are subject to the fewest diseases such are idiots peasants and mechanics and all those we call indolent people     we have before shown that weak limbs and all the bodily organs may be strengthened and repaired by proper exercise and there is no doubt to be made but the organs of sensation and those the mind uses in its intellectual operations may be likewise improved strengthened and perfected by constant use and proper application and if by excesses an original bad conformation or any accident these organs come to be spoiled or by the bad state of the juices they be weakened in their functions then the medicinal and chirurgical arts may take place and come in play but if the passions be raging and tumultuous and constantly fuelled nothing less than he who has the hearts of men in his hands and forms them as a potter does his clay who stills the raging of the seas and calms the tempests of the air can settle and quiet such tumultuous overbearing hurricanes in the mind and animal economy without such a miracle since the soul and body act mutually upon one another and the tabernacle of clay is the weakest part of the compound it must at last be overborn and thrown down     in such a wretched case i know no remedy but to drown all other passions in that spiritual one of the love of god the reasonableness and justness of which proceeding and what may seem a paradox the usefulness of it to health and its benign influence on the animal economy i shall endeavor to demonstrate spiritual love is that principle analogous to attraction spoken of in prop iv it is the tendency bias or impulse of the minds of men and other spirits toward the most amiable objects communicated by their creator in their original formation by virtue of which they constantly tend press and urge to unite and if obstacles were removed would unite with one another and be all united with their origin this principle indeed in this lapsed estate of man where it is overlaid and buried under rubbish involved in so many other attractions and stifled with such letts and contrarieties that its action is felt but just enough to know that it is and wants to be a waked with labor and excited with violence as the scripture mentions the taking the kingdom of heaven by force on its first developement and expansion and in its first exercises may be called a spiritual passion as it is the first motions endeavors and velleities toward the love of god or charity but in its advances and final perfection and consummation it discovers itself to be a faculty quality or inherent power in the soul whereby it will act without solicitation motive or direction as a stone in a wall fastened with mortar compressed by surrounding stones and involved in a million of other attractions cannot fall to the earth nor sensibly exert its natural gravity no not so much as to discover there is such a principle in it just so the intelligent soul in this her lapsed estate being drowned in sense chained and fettered by ignorance and perverseness drawn and hurried away by the devil the world and the flesh is disabled from exerting this inherent and innate principle of reunion and wants sufficient light on the understanding and a right turn of the will to be put in a capacity of exercising it but in its proper vacuity and being freed from these letts and impediments it would mount toward its original like an eagle toward the sun amiability pulchritude or beauty is as much the peculiar and proper object of this affection of the mind as light or a luminous body is of vision for deformity as such can never be loved and beauty or perfection is in reality and just philosophy nothing but analogy order or just proportion from hence it necessarily follows that in the scale of beings all objects ought to be loved in proportion to their degree of beauty symmetry or perfection and consequently the highest perfection ought to be loved with the highest degree of love and the several subordinate degrees of perfection with proportionate degrees of this affection of the mind and since finite when compared with infinite evanishes quite or becomes nothing it follows necessarily since there is and can be but one object that is infinite good and perfect and all others are but created and finite goods that is in comparison they are nothing that according to the eternal and immutable laws of analogy the one supreme good endued with infinite perfection ought to be loved with a love infinitely superior to our affections for other things or which is the same thing in other words that in comparison our love to the author of our being ought to be infinite and that to ourselves and other objects as being finite creatures none at all this is the true philosophy of this matter and as much a demonstration as any thing in numbers or geometry possibly can be however it may be received by men of selflove and carnal minds     yet i would not be so understood as if i condemned all subordinate and duly proportioned regards for ourselves and other objects about us that are necessary for our support and accommodation in our present state no there is a just and laudable selflove as well as a false and vicious one if we love ourselves as we love our neighbors if we love ourselves as god loves us if we love ourselves as we deserve to be loved by the infinitely perfect being if we love ourselves with a justly proportioned and duly subordinate love that is if we love ourselves with a finite and him with an infinite love or a love increasing and going on in infinitum that has neither limits nor end then we love ourselves as we ought this selflove is just and laudable and has its due and proper degree of reality and existence in the nature of things perfection or an object perfect in its kind or one that we think so is the proper object of our love and as in due analogy proportion and order infinite perfection requires infinite love or the highest degree of love we can give it so all other objects are to be loved with a degree of love proportioned to their perfection and since a being of infinite perfection can be but one and all other beings can have but a finite degree of perfection we must love them but with a finite love or the proportion of our love to him and them ought to be as infinite is to finite that is comparatively we ought to love them with no love at all but absolutely or without comparing created things to the infinitely perfect being with their proper degree of finite love according to their rank in the scale of beings  coroll though from the nature of the demonstration i have given that god is to be loved it is evident he is to be loved infinitely for himself and his own infinite perfections abstracting from all other considerations even that of our own happiness in the enjoyment of or union with him yet it is certain these two our love to god and our own happiness cannot be actually separated pleasure consists in this that the soul and body are affected by the objects that produce it with an harmonious and commensurate action or touch for in their original and uncorrupted make as they came from the hands of their creator both separately and each by themselves and also in their actions on one another all was harmony and concord as to the body as nothing but a musical or commensurate touch can affect it with pleasure and as a discordant and uncommensurate stroke creates a jarring grating and obstruction which is pain this is evident in hearing where the agreeable sensations of sonorous bodies are altogether harmonious sir isaac newton has made it plain in vision and no doubt it is so in all the other senses so likewise as to the soul truth and beauty or perfection are the only objects that give pleasure to the understanding and will its two cardinal faculties and these are nothing but harmony or just proportion in the respective objects and we have shown that the union of the soul and body or life the so much coveted good consists in a kind of harmonia praestabilita though a kind very different from mr leibnitzs whereby an harmonious touch or action upon either of them produces a pleasurable sensation now as beauty or perfection gives pleasure to both the parts of the compound and as nothing but the highest degree of perfection or beauty can give the greatest pleasure i e happiness it necessarily follows that spiritual love or the love of god as it is the only mean of uniting us with the one being who is infinitely perfect is also the only mean of making us infinitely happy     as to the second thing proposed concerning spiritual love however foreign these metaphysical speculations concerning it may seem to a discourse about health and long life yet if steadily believed and their natural consequences reduced to practice they would not only become the most effectual means to prevent diseases but also the most of any thing promote health and long life for first were our love proportioned to the order and analogy of things were our love to the supreme good infinite and that to others in comparison none at all we should have but one single view in all our thoughts words and actions viz the promoting and raising that supreme love to its due degree and elevation whereby all anxiety carking care and solicitude about other things the source of all our miseries and of many bodily diseases would be cut off all at once secondly since love always begets resemblance of manners since the object of this love is infinitely perfect if we loved him in the supreme degree we should infinitely endeavor to resemble him whereby hatred and malice luxury and lewdness laziness and all the other seeds of bodily diseases would be altogether destroyed thirdly since spiritual love is not only the noblest but also the most joyful and pleasant affection of the mind since the object of our supreme love as an inspired poet expresses it has fullness of joy in his presence and rivers of pleasures at his right hand for ever and since our joy and happiness will always rise in proportion to our love the placing our supreme love on the supreme good would render us infinitely joyful serene calm and pleased than which certainly no man can imagine a more effectual mean of health and long life  rules of health and long life drawn from the head of the passions   the passions have a greater influence on health than most people are aware of   all violent and sudden passions dispose to or actually throw people into acute diseases and sometimes the most violent of them bring on sudden death   the slow and lasting passions bring on chronical diseases as we see in grief and languishing hopeless love   therefore the sudden and acute passions are more dangerous than the slow or chronical   men of lively imaginations and great vivacity are more liable to the sudden and violent passions and their effects   thoughtful people and those of good understanding suffer most by the slow and secretly consuming passions   the indolent and the thoughtless suffer least from the passions the stupid and idiots not at all   the diseases brought on by the passions may be cured by medicine as well as those proceeding from other causes when once the passions themselves cease or are quieted but the preventing or calming the passions themselves is the business not of physic but of virtue and religion   the love of god as it is the sovereign remedy of all miseries so in particular it effectually prevents all the bodily disorders the passions introduce by keeping the passions themselves within due bounds and by the unspeakable joy and perfect calm serenity and tranquillity it gives the mind becomes the most powerful of all the means of health and long life chap vii containing those observations that came not naturally under the foregoing heads    mention having been so often made of chronical and sometimes of acute distempers it may be convenient here to suggest to the readers as clear an account of their nature and difference as i possibly can acute distempers then are understood such as within some short limited time have their periods either of a perfect crise and subsequent recovery or of putting an end to the distemper and life both together and are therefore called quick sharp or acute distempers whose symptoms are more violent their duration shorter and their periods more quick either of sudden death or a glorious victory over the disease these are generally limited within forty days and those that run out longer turn into chronical distempers whose periods are more slow their symptoms less severe and their duration longer they too if new fuel were not administered to them would by the course of nature and the animal economy have their periods and terminate at the last the viscidity of the juices and the flaccidity of the fibers would in a great measure and to some very tolerable degree by proper remedies and a due regimen be removed and the party recover in these as well as acute cases but this requiring long time much care and great caution unwearied patience and perseverance and so long a course of selfdenial as few people are willing to undergo it is become the reproach of physic and physicians that acute cases cure themselves or rather nature cures them and chronical cases are never cured but both the branches of the reflection are equally false in the first art and care judiciously applied will always alleviate the symptoms and suffering will help on nature to the relief she points out and quicken the crise which it will constantly bring about if the distemper is not too strong for the constitution and even then it will mitigate the pain and lay the patient gently and easily down but in the last case if due care be had to follow timeously the advice of an honest and experienced physician a period certainly may be brought about to most chronical distempers where the great viscera are not spoiled and destroyed the failing is in the patient himself who will not or cannot deny himself for a time sufficient to bring about the cure some chronical distempers indeed are such either by having gone too far or by being hereditary and interwoven with the principles of life as never to be totally overcome and then it is a piece of great wisdom to know how far their constitution will go and sit down contented with that measure of health their original frame will admit of but of this i am morally certain if the rules and cautions laid down in this treatise be carefully steadily and constantly observed few chronical distempers but will receive such relief and alleviation by them as to make life tolerably easy and free from grievous sufferings and in the mentioned case that is all that is left for art to do but in other chronical distempers taken in due time where the viscera are not quite spoiled they would infallibly bring about a final period and perfect cure the most certain distinguishing mark of an acute distemper is to have a quick pulse that of a chronical to have a slow one the first will exhaust the fluids and wear out the solids in a short time whereas the last will require a longer time to produce the same effect some chronical distempers especially toward the last and fatal period turn acute and some acute ones terminate in chronical distempers but this mark will not only keep them distinct but also point out when acute distempers have chronical remissions or intermissions and when chronical distempers have acute fits or paroxysms     some persons who are extremely healthy and sound during their younger days about or soon after the meridian of life that is about thirtyfive or thirtysix according to the observation of an inspired king fall into chronical distempers which cut them off in few years or make them miserable all the rest of their lives thus consumptions prove mortal to some about that time thus stone and gravel gout and rheumatism scurvy and dropsy kings evil and skindiseases either make their first appearances or show themselves in their true type about this time of life the reason is while the juices are sweet sufficiently thin and fluid but especially while the solid organs the membranes and fibers are yet but unfolding stretching and drawing out to their full dimensions any acrimony sharpness or corroding humor can affect them no other way than by making them vibrate and so extend themselves farther and farther for as pain so these sharp salts by their twitching and irritation on the tender fibers make them only contract and so draw at both extremities and thereby unfold and extend themselves farther so while the original foldings and complications of the solids are not yet quite extended this irritation serves only to draw them out and does not hurt them till they are arrived at their full extent which generally happens about fiveandtwenty it takes a due time after that for these sharp humors to exalt themselves to their utmost acrimony to corrupt and putrify the juices and also some more time to wear out to obstruct and break the great organs and their smaller capillary vessels the sum of all which brings the periods of the great attacks of these distempers to the mentioned time of life those in whom the original taint is deeper and more radicated and the natural constitution weaker suffer under these attacks sooner and those in whom it is slighter and more superficial and whose complexion is stronger and more hardy hold out longer but the generality suffer first eminently about the meridian of life hence the common observation of those that die of a genuine consumption that they begin to feel it first before thirtysix     there is no chronical distemper whatsoever more universal more obstinate and more fatal in britain than the scurvy taken in its general extent scarce any one chronical distemper but owes its origin to a scorbutic cachexie or is so complicated with it that it furnishes its most cruel and most obstinate symptoms to it we owe all the dropsies that happen after the meridian of life all diabetes asthmas consumptions of several kinds many sorts of colicks and diarrhaeas some kinds of gouts and rheumatisms all palsies various kinds of ulcers and possibly the cancer itself and most cutaneous foulnesses weakly constitutions and bad digestions vapors melancholy and almost all nervous distempers whatsoever and what a plentiful source of miseries these last are the afflicted best can tell and scarce any one chronical distemper whatsoever but has some degree of this evil faithfully attending it the reason why the scurvy is so peculiar to this country endemick a distemper and so fruitful of miseries is that it is produced by causes mostly special and particular to this island to wit the indulging so much in animal food and strong fermenting liquors in contemplative studies and sedentary professions and employments and thence the want of due labor and exercise together with the nitrous moisture of an island and the inconstancy and inclemency of the seasons thence arising i have had many occasions to show how such causes must necessarily and naturally produce such effects i will here only touch the matter slightly to point out the connection animal foods and strong liquors to excess and with continuance must load and charge the fluids with their salts want of due exercise must suffer these to unite in clusters and increase their bulk in the small vessels their larger bulk and greater acrimony thence arising must increase the viscidity of the fluids by breaking the blood globules and so coagulating the mass and at last obstruct the finer pipes and all the smaller glands whereby the tone of all the elastick fibers must be interrupted and broken and their vibrations stopped at every obstructed gland and capillary vessel and an universal disorder produced in the whole animal economy and this disorder will operate and show it self in symptoms special and particular according to the special and particular make and conformation of the parts the weakness or the strength of the organs the particular mismanagements and precise state of the air the party lives in and the detail of these general causes applied to particular persons must produce the respective diseases mentioned in a word the scurvy is a kind of catholic distemper here in britain arising from constant and general causes from the customs of the people and from the nature of the climate which renders the serous part of the blood too thick and glewy breaks and divides the union of the globulous parts obstructs the small vessels and destroys the springiness and elasticity of the fibers so that most chronical distempers can be little else but branches and cions from this root which like pandoras box is so fruitful of variety of mischiefs and its arising from the climate and customs of the people is the reason why chronical distempers are so frequent in britain to what they are in warmer climates which by a freer perspiration and lighter diet not only prevent those diseases in their own inhabitants but universally cure those of our island who are afflicted with them if they flee to those regions any reasonable time before nature be quite worn out for though the inhabitants of britain live for the most part as long or rather longer than those of warmer climates yet scarce any one especially those of the better sort but becomes crasy and suffers under some chronical distemper or other before they arrive at old age the same reason is to be assigned for the frequency of selfmurders here in england especially beyond any other country for few have grace and resignation enough to suffer patiently the lasting pains of a chronical distemper or the yet more torturing and crucifying anguish of a perpetual dispiritedness though i have observed generally and have good reason to conclude universally that all selfmurderers are first distracted and distempered in their intellectual faculties notwithstanding the diffusiveness and universality of this disease so that scarce a single individual of the better sort is altogether free from it yet i never once in my life saw it totally extirpated in those who had it to any degree so as to be entirely free from it all the rest of their lives after but that it still appeared and sprang up again in some symptom or other and at last brought forth that grand one which put a final period to all their sufferings one good reason for this is that it requires a regimen and conduct so entirely contrary and opposite to the natural habits and customs and the universal bent and appetites of the inhabitants of this island that it becomes a kind of perpetual selfdenial to them which the british nation in general does not mightily admire another reason is that fine folks use their physicians as they do their laundresses send their linen to them to be cleaned in order only to be dirtied again nothing less than a very moderate use of animal food and that of the kind which abounds least in urinous salts as most certainly the young and the lightercoloured do and a more moderate use of spirituous liquors due labor and exercise and a careful guarding against the inconstancy and inclemency of the seasons can keep this hydra under and nothing else than a total abstinence from animal foods and strong fermented liquors can totally extirpate it and that too must be begun early before or soon after the meridian of life or else there will remain too little oil in the lamp the spirits will sink too far ever to be recovered again and the remaining part of life will be too short for so total a change as must be made so that those who suffer greatly under this british distemper must be contented to bear and forbear a little and must expect no greater degree of health than their time of life the nature of their disease and the state of their constitution will admit of but still a great moderation in animal foods and spirituous and fermented liquors due exercise and a care to fence against the injuries of the weather will make life tolerably easy especially if some gentle domestic purges be interspersed the seeds and young sprouts of vegetables have scarce any gross fixed or essential salts at all in them this is not only evident from the reasons formerly given because they are young or the nourishment appointed by nature for young vegetables for the earth is only a proper nest or matrix for them and the suns heat serves them instead of incubation but upon see lowth abridg of phil trans v   p     trial and examination they yield none being too light and thin to calcine and incinerate and the salts too volatile and consequently small and fit to pass by perspiration and thereby can be no way injurious to human constitutions to endure the fire which fullgrown plants their stalks and wood readily do and in unfermented liquors the salts are so enveloped that they cannot unite to form a spirit and are so sheathed by particular coats of the materials of the vegetable that they can scarce do any harm except when they exceedingly abound to animal bodies hence it comes to pass that a vegetable diet for a few weeks or months together with drinking water or unfermented liquors such as tea coffee barleywater liquoricewater teas made of oranges or other seeds and plants will fasten the teeth when dropping out from a consumption of the gums by scorbutic salts cure any cutaneous foulnesses or eruptions and even any spreading ulcer if it is not scrofulous when no medicine on the face of the earth will touch it hence the grand maxim in the cure of all ulcers is by diet to bring them to the state of a wound and then they will cure of themselves and as i have elsewhere observed there is scarce a thin consumptive hysteric or hypochondriack and weakly constitution in england which has not for its parent a latent or manifest scorbutic cachexy excepting that which arises from a scrofula from the whole we may gather how much a proper regimen of diet and due exercise with the other helps and remedies already mentioned in this treatise is able to do in most british chronical distempers     having had so often occasion to speak of weak and relaxed nerves it will not be amiss to suggest some of the outward and most sensible signs and characters whereby it may be manifest whether ones self or any particular person he is concerned for be of this make and constitution before some chronical distemper or other dismal symptom has made it plain in order to prevent these as far as possible to which purpose we must observe that the nerves are bundles of solid springy and elastick threads or filaments like twisted catguts or hairs whose one extremity is terminated at the common sensory in the brain where the soul is supposed to reside the other is interwoven into every point of the scarfskin the membranes the coats of the vessels the muscles and the other sensible solids of the body in order to convey the motions actions vibrations or impulses of outward objects to the soul these threads or filaments are highly elastick or springy as we may see from their hardened substances such as whalebone ivory horn and cartileges which are more eminently so than any other bodies known some persons have their fibers very quick readily vibrating highly springy and elastick so as to tremble and shake violently by the least impulse others have more rigid firm and stretched fibers which yield not but to strong impressions and move slowly but move for a long time lastly there are those who have weak loose slender and relaxed fibers which though easily moved and yielding to the weakest impulse yet communicate only imperfect languid and faint impressions and vibrations to the soul and have all their other animal functions of the same languishing nature and it is of these last i have been all along speaking and we may readily discover them by these outward characters and signs   those who have naturally soft thin small and short hair are of a loose flabby and relaxed state of nerves for the hair seems to be some of the fleshy fibers only lengthened outward and hardened at least like the fibers they consist of a great many lesser filaments contained in a common membrane are solid transparent and elastick and as these hairs are in strength and bulk so generally the fibers of the body are   those of the fairest hair are of the loosest fibers other things being equal because the fairest are more rare porous and fungous and because bodies of the lighter colors consist of smaller parts than those of the more flaming colors as has been formerly observed   those of large or as they are called mastiff muscles and of big bones are generally of a firmer state of nerves than those of little muscles and bones because the muscles and bones being similar to their fibers as is highly probable and these being bigger and consequently stronger so must those be and on the contrary   soft yielding pappy flesh is a sure symptom of loose fibers whereas hard firm and unyielding muscles are the constant sign of firm fibers   a white fair blanched or ashencoloured complexion or skin constantly indicates a weaker and more relaxed state of fibers than a ruddy fresh dark sallow or black hue for reasons already given   a fat corpulent and phlegmatic constitution is always attended with loose flabby and relaxed fibers by their being dissolved and oversoaked in moisture and humidity and on the contrary those of a dry clean and firm make have strong firm and tense fibers   those who are subject to evacuations of any kind in any degree greater than what is natural and those who by any accident have suffered long by any preternatural evacuation whatsoever are or become of loose relaxed fibers and nerves thus those who frequently run into purging or floods of pale water flow at the mouth or nose or melt into profuse sweats those who any way have lost much blood have had a diarrhoea have recovered of a fever and those of the sex who have purified longer or more than is usual all of these are originally or become accidentally of weak and relaxed nerves and fibers   lastly those who are of a cold constitution are apt to run into coldnesses on their extremities or ready to catch cold are also of weak and loose fibers and nerves because these are signs of a slow and interrupted circulation and perspiration which manifests a weak spring in the fibers of the coats of the vessels the fibers of the muscles and a weakness of the spring of the scales of the scarfskin     on this occasion of rehearsing the signs of weak nerves i cannot omit apprising those of the breeding part of the sex and those who are concerned in them of their readiness of miscarrying unless duly tended and managed especially those of them of tender and weak nerves or of too delicate a constitution the signs i have now laid down will always make it evident if any particular person is so or not and if upon examination they be found to be such they will be apt upon the slightest occasion to run into frequent miscarriages whereby a great part of their posterity will be destroyed and they themselves exposed to dropsies or consumptions or which is worse than either perpetual lowness of spirits vapors and other hysteric disorders and by this misfortune alone a considerable part of the better sort here in england perish and are lost nature has formed the generality of the sex of a soft slender and delicate make want of due exercise a full table indiscreet nurses overfond mothers and hereditary sharpnesses make them much more so and if by neglect or accident they once begin to miscarry every first miscarriage paves the way for a second and a third and so on till the poor pretty creature has neither blood nor spirits appetite nor digestion left for one miscarriage weakens the constitution breaks and tears the nervous system more than two mature births if ever this is to be secured or prevented effectually it is to be done at least attempted in the first instance if possible at least as soon as may be before a total relaxation and dissolution of the nervous system is brought on the giddiness romping and gadding about of the young creature herself is often the cause of her miscarriage but oftener the forwardness and indiscretion of surgeons and midwives by bleeding on every little threatening symptom without considering the constitution bleeding may do well enough in sanguine robust and plethorick constitutions but it is death and certain rain to those of slender and weak nerves and the surest way to cause the miscarriage it is designed to prevent by relaxing the nervous fibers which bleeding does as certainly as it lessens the quantity of the blood the most effectual method i have ever found to prevent such misfortunes is to order those in such circumstances to drink plentifully bristol water with a very little red wine for their constant drink to lay the plaster ad herniam with oil of cinnamon and london laudanum in a due proportion to their reins to keep them to a low light easily digested diet especially of the farinaceous vegetables and milk meats to strengthen their bowels with diascordium and toasted rhubarb if they become too slippery to air them once or twice a day in a coach or chair and to keep them cheerful and in good humor as much as may be this method will scarce ever fail unless a latent scrofula or some other hereditary sharpnesses in their juices destroy the birth     the tender sickly and those of weak nerves ought to have a regard in the conduct of their health to the different seasons of the year i have elsewhere essay on the gout observed that such constitutions begin to sink droop and languish about christmas or midwinter go on from worse to worse till the spring is over get up a little as the sun grows higher and stronger arrive at their meridian altitude of health and strength about midsummer and hold it out so long as the sun warms them or the strength they have acquired lasts those who have very weak nerves fail sooner even about the autamnal equinox but they get up sooner because their weaker nerves make less resistance the sun new ferments rarifies and exalts their viscid juices so that the circulation is better performed more full free and universal the perspiration is also thereby much increased and promoted and the load being drawn off by the force of the suns heat their appetite is sharpened and their digestion mended to which the serene warm and clear air and the greater liberty of exercise and business contributes i should advise such therefore religiously to follow the indications of nature and to take these benefits it offers then as a certain sign of their being best and fittest for them after christmas and in the beginning of the spring milk eggs and springherbs as asparagus spinach and sprouts come in first of which i advise them to make the greatest part of their diet then as the spring advances lamb and veal green pease and sallading abound after the vernal equinox chicken and rabbit young turkies and early fruit come in season about midsummer mutton and partridge colliflower and artichoak may be had and autumn brings in beef and venison turnip and carrot and it will be found the concoctive powers of weak persons and those of relaxed nerves rise and fortify gradually as these stronger foods come in season by season i mean not those earlier days that luxury in the buyers and avarice in the sellers about london have forced the several kinds of vegetables and animals in but by season i mean that time of the year in which by nature common culture and the mere operation of the sun and climate they are in most plenty and perfection in this country but the principal point i would urge is that such persons would regularly begin to correspond with nature in both lessening the quantity and lowering the quality of their food as the seasons indicate and providence provides the proper food in greatest plenty and perfection by which they will preserve the balance of their health pretty near equal all the year round have the lightest and least food when their concoctive powers are least and their nervous fibers weakest and rise in the food in proportion as these rise add to these that as winter is best for home exercises summer is fittest for those without doors and as the day lengthens their labor and exercises abroad ought to be lengthened out neither sydenham nor fuller have been able to tell the half of what obstinate exercise will do in low cachectick consumptive cases  q d unwearied exercise will overcome any chronical distemper  labor omnia vincit improbus  horat    the germans have a proverb that wise men ought to put on their winter clothes early in autumn and put them off late in the spring by which they would insinuate that people ought always to go wellcloathed whatever may be in this as to persons that drink hard and require a plentiful discharge by the skin those who are sober or who would render themselves hardy ought to accustom themselves to as few clothes both in summer and winter as is possible besides the general rule of having as few necessaries as may be much and heavy clothes attract and draw too much by perspiration as dr keill proves in his med static britann tender and debilitate the habit and weaken the strength the custom of wearing flanel is almost as bad as a diabetes nothing can enfeeble and drain weak and tender persons more to make this clear we must distinguish between perspiration and sweating which differ as widely as the daily natural emptying our bowels and a looseness or diarrhaea and as no body in their senses much less the tender and weakly would endeavor to encourage this last no more ought they that other of sweating for as promoting slippery bowels would always keep the fibers of the alimentary passages relaxed so would perpetual sweating those of the skin and as the moisture and damps that flanel perpetually keeps the skin in and its growing so readily dirty shows what a flux of perspiration it promotes there so the perpetual friction produced by it gives the reason if one lays on a superfluous load of strong liquors it is happy for him nature discharges the ocean any how for he had better sweat than burn in a fever but for temperate tender and sickly persons the more firm and tight all the organs of their evacuations be if they be not totally obstructed the better it will be for them the more it will strengthen their nerves and harden their constitution nothing but superfluity in food or strong liquors requires sweating and that is the reason the germans run so much upon it so far that in his medicina mentis and corporis tschirnhaus a very learned and ingenious gentleman otherwise resolves the cure of almost all distempers into sweating upon observing its success in their bottlefevers they drink much thin sharp wine which passes every way and when it comes through the skin both the conflict and the danger is over but for those inhabitants of our islands who are sober because they are tender or would preserve their health the lighter and fewer their clothes are both by night and by day in summer and winter the hardier they will grow the more open the whole body is to the air provided it be benign the more fluid and the more active will the animal juices be and by consequence the more full and free will the perspiration be for right tempered air is beneficial and medicinal to the animal juices and a great heap of clothes only condenses our own excrementitious atmosphere about us and stops the kindly influence of this beneficial element as to catching cold he that lives soberly and avoids nitrous that is moist or frosty air will either not readily catch cold or if he does will soon get rid of it it is only air thus conditioned that thickens and coagulates our juices and gives painful and dangerous colds it is inward heat only which destroys us no sober persons ever suffered by cold unless it were extreme or that they expose themselves obstinately to it against sense and reason     another mean of health to the tender studious and sedentary is much and often shaving head and face and washing scraping and paring their feet and toes the great benefit besides the pleasure to the head eyes and ears by often shaving the head and face and washing them daily in cold water with a few drops of the compound spirit of lavender or hungary water is best understood by those that have felt it the cutting off the hair and shaving the head will in the first instance scarce fail to cure a headache a fluxion or even a nervous weakness of the eyes any one evacuation will not only lessen the whole mass but if encouraged will make that evacuation more ample and full the more and oftener the hair is shaved the faster and thicker it will grow so that thus shaving the head and face frequently will be like an issue or perpetual blister on these parts besides the washing with warm water and soap and scraping the skin with a razor will cleanse the mouths of the perspiratory ducts from that morphew and scurf that adheres to them and will extremely encourage the perspiration from these parts and give a full and free vent to the fumes on the head and brain and washing well and dipping in cold water afterward will shut the scales of the scarfskin and secure against catching cold in the head which is frequently a heavy grievance to tender studious and sedentary persons therefore i should advise such to shave both head and face every day or every other day or as often as they possibly can and wash them well in cold water afterward what shaving does to the upper parts the same do washing and scraping the feet and paring their nails to the lower we know by the ticklishness of the soles what a multitude of fine nervous fibers terminate in them walking standing and treading render them callous and the skin thick and hard which much injures the perspiration and hinders the derivation of the blood and spirits into them and it is a common observation that nothing is a surer sign of strong and rank health than a kindly heat and a profuse perspiration on the feet it shows a full and free circulation in the small vessels at the greatest distance from the source of heat and motion than which nothing can more plainly indicate great and good health on the contrary weak and tender persons are always cold in the legs and feet and first of all feel cold there in frosty weather let the tender therefore and the weakly duly once a week wash in warm water rub scrape and pare their feet and nails which will likewise prevent corns hardnesses and the unnatural tendency of their nails into the flesh these are it is true but low and seemingly trifling observations toward health but it is in this case as it is in a more momentous one he that despises little things shall perish by little and little     those tender and valetadinary people whose studies or profession oblige them to read or write much ought as far as they possibly can to stand in an erect posture bending their head and breast as little as may be leaning only on a sloping desk and continuing their exercises in that posture till they grow weary then rest and be at it again custom and practice obstinately persisted in will at length render the posture easy to them and it is inconceivable how many and great advantages it will bring to the constitution sitting bending and leaning low compress some if not many of the vessels of the body and so stop and retard the circulation of the blood and juices through them which makes a more ready flux through the other more patent and pervious ones whence that sleepiness and disability to motion in the limbs till the blood and spirits by a proper posture get a free admittance into them from this also there ensues an unequable and subsultory circulation of the juices and an unequable secretion in the glands and consequently an unequal growth strength and vigor of the organs and parts which is the cause of rickets in children careless nurses neglecting to rock dandle and toss them sufficiently that the circulation of the juices and spirits may be equally promoted every where and to avoid this inconveniency seems to be the reason why the romans and the eastern nations lay along at their great meals and feasts and when they were obliged to continue long in one posture besides that in writing or reading if one sits there is a constant pressure on the cavity of the breast and stomach which must necessarily weaken their functions and these are commonly the organs which first decay in clerks and under secretaries and hanging down the head is the ready way to raise fumes and vapors to it whereby such will be exposed to lowness of spirits and perhaps consumptions all which are in a great measure avoided by an erect posture for thereby all the organs will be in their natural situation many of the muscles will be in action and so press on the blood vessels to facilitate the circulation but chiesly by this erect posture the juices will have the advantage of their own gavity to descend with the greater velocity to warm and cherish the lower parts which are remotest from the source of motion and the grosser evacuations will be more readily promoted and thereby preserve the upper regions clear and serene which will bring great advantages toward health and long life but this practice will never become easy unless to those who begin young those who dictate or consult ought to do them standing or walking which would relieve both body and mind    0 the unwieldy fat and overgrown besides the rules already laid down i advise in particular as much as is possible for them to abstain from drink of all kinds no one rule or condition ever was contrived or can be of so great use to preserve and lengthen the lives of such as an obstinate and universal astinence from all kinds of liquors if the doctrine be true as it is highly probable that the mass of all the bodies of vegetables and animals is only pipes and vascular tubes formed all at once in their first rudiments and seeds then growth and increase of bulk is only filling and plumping up diluting and unfolding these pipes with liquors we know from kirchers and dr woodwards experiments to what bulk vegetables will thrive by mere element alone two pigs of the same litter were fed upon an equal quantity of milk only to one of them the milk was mixed with the same quantity of water after a months feeding they were both killed and that which had the water was found much larger and fatter than the other dropsies at least anasarcas have been cured by an obstinate forbearance of drink and lethargies proceed from the moisture of the brain and these are the two distempers unwieldy fat and overgrown persons are most subject to therefore such ought to avoid drink as those do who have the i e dread of water a disease so called proceeding from the bite of a mad dog hydrophobia or are bit by a mad dog which they may easily bring about if they feed only on young animal and moist and cool vegetable food but whenever i speak of vegetable food i mean that which is dressed by fire      to the aged and those who are passing off the stage of life i have only two things to recommend if they would make the last hour as easy indolent and free from pain as may be the first is that they would avoid the injuries of the weather as much as ever they can the blood of the aged is ever most certainly poor and viscid their perspiration little or none at all and their concoctive powers weak and consequently they must be subjected to and suffer by the weakest injuries of the weather therefore i advise such to keep home provide warm rooms and beds and good fires whenever the sky lowrs winds blow or the air is sharp such are not to expect to raise improve or exalt their constitutions or health freedom from pain to prevent the vital flames being extinguished by accidents and to have it burn as clear and as long as nature at their age has designed it should is all they ought to aim at exercise is only to purge off superfluities if these therefore be careful not to exceed they will want none nor would it much contribute to their ease for in old men the bones petrify the cartilages and tendons turn into bones and the muscles and nerves into cartilages and tendons and all the solids lose their elasticity and turn in a great measure into that earth they are going to be dissolved into so that the solids wanting elasticity exercise can do but little to shake off the load it will therefore be enough for such to air themselves when the sun lights them and the summer breezes can refresh them or if they would lengthen out their days to remove to a warmer climate by which they may live as long as the crow the second thing i would advise such is to lessen their diet gradually as they grow older before nature has forced this diminution upon them this is a powerful mean to make their old age green and indolent and to preserve the remains of their senses to the very last by this alone cornaro lengthned out his days and preserved his senses in a great measure entire to a hundred years he gradually lessened his diet so far that as his historian informs us he came at last to live on the yolk of an egg three days i will not take upon me to advise others in what measure either of time or quantity of food they ought to diminish but this i think they ought to consider that since it is certain aged persons become children as to the weakness of their digestions they ought to diminish as children increase in their food from weaker to weaker and from less to less for as their solids are unelastick their concoctive powers weak their perspiration little and the expenses of living scarce any their repairs not to overlay the spark of life remaining ought to lessen proportionally and it is to the neglect of this in aged persons that those rheums catarrhs wind and colicks loss of memory and senses those aches and pains and all that dismal and black train of miseries that wait on long life is mostly owing which by a discreet and timeous lessening their diet might in a great measure be prevented      there is no mistake more fatal in the cure of chronical distempers incident to the weak and tender than the vain and unjust expectation they entertain of a sudden and quick cure or even of a sensible relief this with their inconstancy and impatience of being confined in their appetites makes them either throw off all remedies and restraints in despair and give themselves up to an habitual indulgence in all those things that brought on or exasperated the distemper or run about changing from doctor to doctor till they end with a quack or die under the hands of a mountebank and are fooled out of their lives and money at once it is surprising that reasonable men can imagine that in any small time any possible methods or medicines should cure or even sensibly relieve a distemper that perhaps was brought with them into the world and interwoven with the principles of their being or at least may have been ten or twenty years a breeding by excesses or an indiscreet regimen i know no fitter similitude of the case than the annual income of an estate just sufficient to keep one in decent necessaries and due plenty and cleanness if one that has such an estate run out every year for ten or twenty years and then set about to retrieve before he be come to starving or a gaol would we not count him mad if he should imagine by retrenching management or saving even joining to those daylabour that a few months or years would recover all and bring his estate to its first condition no he must labor abstain and manage for several years and the time required will be always in a proportion compounded of the rate of his former expenses and his present saving that is if his expenses were but small and his savings great the time will be the shorter in respect of the time he continued his overspending if he gives over saving he must at last most certainly starve or go to gaol and if he begins to save in due time he will certainly retrieve all but the whole consists in labor and saving for a due time excesses and an undue regimen is running out of ones health which without a proper remedy as labor and abstinence will necessarily bring a man to diseases or death and these must be continued a time proportioned to the greatness of the excesses with regard to the labor and abstinence most chronical distempers have for their parents corrupted fluids and broken solids as has been shown a bad state of the stomach and alimentary organs either beget these or accompany them suppose for example the case be a scorbutic habit showing it self with blotches and a watery ichor or bumps with yellow or black spots on the skin a thick viscid rheumatick blood an obstructed liver and a constant overflowing of the gall oppression of spirits want of appetite and digestion and thereby a wasting lassitude inquietude etc which i have often met with in your bon vivants and your freelivers who have been born healthy vigorous and lively i know no way in nature to relieve and effectually cure this case but by oftenrepeated gentle vomits and stomach purges as the choler which certainly degenerates into phlegm before the cure be brought about for phlegm is but choler more diluted or the grosser part of the serum only as choler is that of the whole arterial fluid and when choler is come to phlegm the cure is half carried on one part of the fluids being already purified and the liver free and open as the choler i say and the phlegm rises and loads the alimentary passages bitters aromaticks and steel varied and prescribed according to the strength of the patient and one kind as another has lost its virtue chalybeat and mineral waters constant labor and exercise a cool light spare diet and constant proper regimen long and obstinately persisted in the patient will often complain what vomits and bitters galloping and fasting for ever vomits only relieve for a few days but do not cure we grow as bad as ever again and in some months perseverance find ourselves just where we began new doctors must be had and they must either be cashiered if they pursue the same intentions which if they be honest men they must do or else must write things that can neither do good nor harm or those which will actually hurt for their fees for there is no medium till the miserable person has run through the whole faculty and at last got into the charlatan tribe it is certain that when nature has begun to throw the gross and viscid parts of the juices on those loose and spungy glands it will continue so to do till it has deflegmated the whole mass and every new vomit will make room for another and there is no other remedy as long as there is any viscid humor remaining nor can the decline of the disease be discovered so certainly by any thing as by the lessening of the quantity excerned and the lengthening of the intervals as in a vessel of oil and water incorporated a sure way to separate the oil from the water is to skim it off as it comes to the top now as long as there is any oil remaining it will swim if you but give it time to extricate itself from the embraces of the water and then you may separate the viscid mixture entirely no great purpose in life was ever brought about but by time and patience and by constantly pursuing the most natural and best approved means that lead toward that end nature works not by sudden jumps and starts but goes on steadily fortement and doucement and it is nature that is the true physician art only removes obstacles checks violences and gently sollicites nature the way she tends this requires time and patience tempus edax rerum it most certainly consumes chronical diseases if not fuelled and fed nothing else can      in fine providence has been kind and gracious to us beyond all expression in furnishing us with a certain relief if not a remedy even to our most intense pains and extreme miseries when our patience can hold out no longer and our pains are at last come to be insupportable we have always ready at hand a medicine which is not only a present relief but i may say a standing and constant miracle those only who have wanted it most and have felt its friendly and kind help in their tortures can best tell its wonderful effects and the great goodness of him who has bestowed it on us i mean opium and its solution laudanum which when properly prescribed and prudently managed is a most certain and sudden relief in all exquisite and intense pain the manner of its operation may be gathered from the observations i have made in the preceding treatise pain constricts crisps up shortens and contracts animal fibers it acts like a wedge in tearing rending and dividing these small filaments it does to them in a living body what the points of salts do to all animal substances which are to be preserved for food viz hardens stiffens and contracts them the fibers of live animals being contractile tonick and springy when a hard pointed body enters them which is the case in all bodily pain the parts by their contractile nature fly from recede and shun as much as possibly they can the wounding instrument this appears in the large gash of a wound made across the fibers of a muscle in the continual bending toward the other side when any part of one is pained in the cramps and convulsions nay and sometimes fevers produced by intense acute pain pleasure on the contrary relaxes the fibers by a gentle soft and bland or as the mathematicians speak a commensurate and harmonious touch it acts on the fibers as two unison and concordant musical instruments act on one another and by stroaking softening and smoothing comes at last entirely to relax and unbend them the parts of the fibers run after follow and pursue and at last break their union in some degree to reach such a demulcent touch some persons have had the faculty to allay pain by gently smoothing the afflicted part with their hands which in some measure was true of the touching doctor soft oils and emollient herbs with gentle warmth by relaxing the crisped fibers will allay pain soft beds and clothes and tepid baths will relax and weaken the whole habit now since pain so certainly crisps up constricts and contracts animal fibers and since opiates infallibly if duly dosed relieve and ease pain i can see no possible way it can effect that but by relaxing and unbending these fibers as much or near as much as pain contracts and draws them up and that this is the real fact we may observe from many effects of opiates   nothing is so powerful or so certain a diaphoretick as an opiate nothing causes such plentiful sweating especially if joined with volatiles and promoted with plentiful drinking small warm liquors this it can do only by relaxing the fibers of the skin and perspiratory glands   nothing so much palls the appetite and weakens the first digestions as the frequent use of opiates insomuch that most people after a liberal dose of them seldom fail to reach and never care for food for a considerable time after till their effects are wrought off which are the constant symptoms of a relaxed stomach and guts   nothing so much promotes the eruption of the smallpox and measles the expulsion of the stone and foetus the monthly and the afterbirth purifications of the sex as opiates insomuch that in difficult births they are now the only resource of the midwife physicians and when joined with volatiles will bring on the most powerful and vigorous throws in the most weak and languishing constitutions these effects they can produce only by relaxing those fibers pain has contracted and rendered unelastick in some measure   nothing quiets and stops cramps convulsions and hysteric fits so suddenly and certainly as opiates do and every one knows these arise from violent contractions and crisping up of the muscular fibers all these and many more such effects opiates produce by unbending loosening and relaxing those fibers violent and acute pain had constricted and contracted and by giving a respite and reprieve from its tortures and thereby allowing nature the only true physician to go undisturbed about its own work the way it stops purging and cures a diarrhaea i take to be by carrying off the sharp and watery humors in the bowels by perspiration which opium exceedingly promotes by quieting those spasms and convulsions and allaying those stimulations excited by purging and settling and calming the violence of the peristaltick motion of the guts which hurries off their contents i will not take upon me here to determine the proper cases for opiates or their doses that is the business of the physician but in general i may say wherever pain is acute intolerable and past enduring where it may endanger convulsions a fever or inflammation after premising the proper universal evacuations such as bleeding blistering cupping purging or glistering as the case requires or will bear opiates then will most certainly relieve and may be safely administered if the case is attended with vomiting solid opium will do best because it will be in a smaller volume and will not be so readily rejected if speedy relief be required where there is no vomiting then laudanum will disperse soonest through the habit because liquid and joined with a spirituous vehicle will soonest effect the design raise the oppressed spirits more and penetrate deeper and quicker in common cases a vinous vehicle will be sufficient because opium is best dissolved in wine to make laudanum there are four cases in which it is absolutely and eminently necessary the cholick the stone the hard labors afterbirth and monthly sluggish purifications of the sex especially if attended with violent pain as is common in such cases and in the gout and rheumatism in the first it ought always to be given with some stomach purge as elixir salutis or tincture of hiera picra with syrup of buckthorn and in those of more tender bowels with tincture of rhubarb especially if the cholick is in the lower bowels and attended with no vomiting in which case an artificial vomit is to be premised if circumstances forbid it not in the stone it ought to be given with oil of sweet almonds or in some soft emulsion to lubricate the parts in the two last cases it ought always to be given with proper volatiles antihystericks and attenuants in violent and acute pain the first dose ought to be large at least from thirty to fortyfive drops of liquid laudanum or its equivalent in opium from two grains and a half to three and a half and afterward to be increased by fifteen drops of liquid or half a grain of solid laudanum every half hour till the pain begin to remit and then an entire stop is to be put to its administration and thus the end will be obtained without any fear of overdosing and the truth is there is less hazard of that than persons are aware for those who die of an overdose of laudanum in the opinion of the world would have lived few days without it for there are those that by custom have brought themselves to two drams of solid that is near six ounces of liquid laudanum a day and i know a gentleman who took near three ounces at once instead of elixir salutis and had never taken any in his life before who though it extremely weakened his stomach for some time and that he dosed almost a month under it yet did well and for ought i know is alive still though it be many years since if the preceding dose be rejected by vomiting about a third part may be supposed to stay and then the subsequent doses may be proportioned accordingly the difference of constitutions will make no great alteration here since very weak persons seldom suffer very violent pain which is the only case i am here considering      to draw toward a conclusion the grand secret and sole mean of long life is to keep the blood and juices in a due state of thinness and fluidity whereby they may be able to make those rounds and circulations through the animal fibers wherein life and health consist with the fewest rubs and least resistance that may be in spite of all we can do time and age will fix and stiffen our solids our original frame and make renders this unavoidable and necessary as in the greater world the sea sir isaac newtons princip quantity of the fluids is daily lessening and decreasing so in our lesser world after a limited time the appetite and concoctions failing the fluids are lessened and spent on the continual repairs of the solids and thereby lose their nature and become firm and hard for by insinuating themselves into all the pores of the solids and the interstices of their parts and straitening and damming up the small vessels which carry in nourishment to the internal substance of the solids and so depriving them of their moisture and lubricating juices these solids come at last to harden stiffen and fix and thereby lose their elasticity and springiness here the process is mechanical and necessary age and time by weakening the concoctions impairing the natural heat which consists in a brisk and extended circulation of the juices by the turning those juices into solid substances and thereby fixing and hardening these solids and depriving them of their due elasticity the fluids circulate with less velocity and force and seldom reach the extremities and smallest vessels but pass through the more patent and larger vessels by their biggest lateral branches and if with all these unavoidable and irremediable circumstances both the nutritious and serous part of the blood and the globular become viscid thick and glewy the circulation must stop at last and come to an end now it is certainly in a great measure in our power to maintain the juices in a due state of fluidity and thinness and to render them such if they are not corrupted to an extreme degree so that the remaining part of life be not too short for such a tedious work we certainly may dilute and thin any fluid that has an inlet and outlet and the more fluid a circulating liquor is that is the smaller and finer its parts are the less force it will require to set it a going and to continue its motion and in animal bodies the thinner and more fluid the juices are they will not only circulate by the less force and with less resistance i e pain but also they will preserve by their circulation the solids the longer from stiffening and hardening there is not a more mischievous nor greater mistake than the common one that thin blood is poor blood which the vulgar and herd of mankind are as terribly affrighted for as outward poverty and want for on the contrary the thinnest and most fluid blood is the richest that is the best blood if rich and good mean the same thing for in hydropical anasarcous cachectick and scorbutic persons both the serous and globular part of the blood is thick glewy and acrimonious so that it can neither get through the small vessels nor can it be long contained in them but corrodes and frets them and so falls at least the thinnest part of it into the cavities and begets a dropsy or stops in and obstructs these small vessels and so becomes an anasarca or scurvy in all which cases the serous part is overloaded with urinous salts and becomes a perfect lixivium so that by its grossness it cannot run into globules to facilitate the circulation through the capillaries for these small elastick globules by turning oval or oblong wonderfully facilitate the circulation of the juices through the small passages and the red or globular part becomes a mere cake of glue and thus the quantity of serum is increased and the quantity of the globular part gradually lessened and in this sense of a greater proportion of serum this state of the blood may be called thin but it can in no sense be called good blood the thinnest and most fluid blood is ever to be looked upon as the best blood as consisting of finest and smallest parts which most readily runs into red globules and most easily circulates through the capillary vessels which is the most solid foundation of good health and long life now as nothing but indulging in strong high foods which the concoctive powers cannot break and divide into parts small enough to run into red globules or circulate through the small vessels but overstock them with urinous salts which run into clusters and first obstruct and afterward break these small vessels and in wallowing in strong liquors which parboil and eat out the tender and delicate fibers of the solids i say as nothing but such an indulgence and such excesses long continued and obstinately persisted in can beget such a state of the fluids and solids and so bring on a cachexy which may end in a dropsy or some other fatal chronical distemper according to the habits and particular make and constitution of the party for no person that lived low and meagre and drank only small and thin liquors ever became hydropical if his solids were originally firm and his fluids not tainted with some hereditary sharpness so i know nothing under the sun that can solidly and fully effectuate the contrary state of the blood and juices to render them thin sweet and in a constant flowing condition but taking the contrary measures and keeping to a strict regimen of a thin fluid spare and lean diet we have no possible way to attenuate clean and dilute a vessel full of gross glewy and foul mixtures that has only a small inlet and outlet but by pouring into it a thin clear insipid fluid and by shaking it often and much it is much the same with an animal body no voluptuous nor lazy person unless he has had an original constitution of brass was ever a long liver and even then as his life has been more misery and pain than ever a sober gally slave endured his end and the latter part of his days has been rack and torture horror and despair and though he has not had the hope nor consolation of a martyr yet his sufferings have been far more exquisite and extreme all those who have lived long and without much pain have lived abstemiously poor and meagre cornaro prolonged his life and preserved his senses by almost starving in his latter days and some others have done the like they have indeed thereby in some measure weakened their natural strength and qualified the fire and flux of their spirits but they have preserved their senses weakened their pains prolonged their days and procured themselves a gentle and quiet passage into another state gentle domestic purges frequently repeated due exercise and the use of the other means prescribed in the foregoing treatise will mightily contribute toward this end but the ground work must be laid carried on and finished in abstemiousness and though not in absolute fasting for that is no ways required and would be prejudicial yet in a thin poor low light and meagre diet all the rest will be insufficient without this and this alone without these will suffice to carry on life as long as by its natural frame it was made to last and will make the passage easy and calm as a taper goes out for want of fuel  miscellany rules of health and long life   chronical diseases last long wear out the constitution leisurely and are accompained with a slow pulse whereas acute ones soon terminate either in death or recovery and are joined with a quick pulse   the scurvy is the root of most chronical diseases of the british nation and is a necessary consequence of their way of living almost wholly on animal food and drinking so much strong liquors   soft thin small short fair hair slender muscles and bones soft flesh a white fair blanched or ashencolcured complexion a fair corpulent phlegmatic cold constitution chilliness especially in the feet a readiness to catch colds and being subject to immoderate evacuations of any kind are certain signs of loose flabby or relaxed nerves   women of weak nerves are very subject to miscarriages their danger is increased by high living and indiscreet bleeding the only remedy for them is drinking bristol water and red wine with a low and light diet going abroad to get air and using astringent plasters and other proper medicines to corroborate their bowels   the weak and sickly as their concoctive powers fail in winter and recover in summer should carefully proportion the quantity and quality of their food to the strength of them in the several seasons   the fewer clothes one uses the hardier he will be flannel and great loads of clothes by day or night relax the fibers and promote only sweating instead of the natural and beneficial perspiration   the weak sedentary and studious should frequently shave their head and face wash and scrape their feet and pare the nails of their toes   people that read and write much ought to do them standing or in as erect a posture as they can and those who can go about any part of their studies walking should do it   the fat unweildy and overgrown ought to avoid all manner of drink strong and small and even water itself as much as possible and if their food be vegetables and young animals they will have little occasion for any liquor  0 the aged should   carefully guard against all the injuries of the weather and   lessen the quantity and lower the quality of their food gradually as they grow older even before a manifest decay of appetite force them to it    as chronical diseases are not brought on all at once so they cannot be quickly removed a gradual corruption must be gradually remedied it is contrary to the nature of chronical diseases to be quickly cured    in all acute and vehement pain opium is the sovereign relief particularly in the colic stone gout rheumatism and hard labor of women it operates by relaxing and unbending the fibers overstretched and crisped up by pain    the great secret of health and long life lies in keeping the blood and consequently the other juices of the body in a due degree of fluidity conclusion to conclude without taking the benefit of revelation which in a sense relating even to our mortal bodies has brought life and immortality to light if but the precepts of the pagan philosophers were observed  servare modum finemque tueri naturamque sequi  if men would but observe the golden mean in all their passions appetites and desires if in all their thoughts words and actions they would but mind i will not say the end of their being and existence here but the end to which their thoughts words and actions naturally tended in their last resort and lastly if in the gratifications of their appetites passions and desires they followed the uncorrupted dictates of nature and neither spurred her on beyond her craving nor too violently restrained her in her innocent biass they would enjoy a greater measure of health than they do have their sensations more delicate and their pleasures more exquisite live with less pain and die with less horror for had it not been for the lewdness luxury and intemperate gratifications of the passions and appetites which first ruined and spoiled the constitution of the fathers whereby they could communicate only a diseased crasy and untuneable carcass to their sons so that with the worlds decay vicious souls and putrified bodies have in this our age arrived to their highest and most exalted degrees i say had it not been for these evils there never had happened so much sickness pain and misery so unhappy lives and such wretched ends as we now behold among men but even in this our lapsed estate and condition had the dictates of nature and reason not to say religion been followed we might have passed our days in indolence at least from chronical distempers if not innocent pleasures arrived at a good old age with our senses free and our rational faculties clear and at last departed in peace as a lamp goes out for want of oil and let the gentlemen of wit and fire of banter and sneer hug themselves ever so much in their boasted tranquillity and security gratify their passions appetites and humors to the full and despise futurity and whining i dare promise when the farce is ended and the last minutes are drawing on they would prefer a life thus led and an end so calm to all the pleasures of lewdness and sensuality and the bounces of a false and ignorant security  finis
