lawtracts  by joseph ritson of grays inn barrister  et in arcadia ego london m dcc xciv  contents i the office of constable ii the jurisdiction of the court leet iii a digest of the proceedings of the court leet of the manor and liberty of the savoy the office of constable being an entirely new compendium of the law concerning that ancient minister for the conservation of the peace  carefully compiled from the best authorities  with a preface and an introduction containing some account of the origin and antiquity of the office  london printed for whieldon and butterworth fleet street  mdccxci  preface a sincere wish to benefit the community by furnishing its most ancient most constitutional and most useful officer with a compendious system or manual of his duty and powers carefully extracted from and upon an actual perusal of the best authorities has produced the following sheets  a mere epitome in fact of the original compilation but the utility of the measure seemed upon second thoughts to be more favored by a pamphlet affording the fullest information in the narrowest compass than by a volume which the verbose prolixity of modern statutes vying as it were with each other in conveying the simplest regulation in the most embarrassing manner and greatest possible number of words would have extended to a size and price little calculated to invite the class of readers for whom it was principally intended the decision therefore was in favor of the briefest summary such a one as men who have little money leisure or capacity one or other or indeed all of which are unfortunately too often met with in the composition of a modern constable might buy read and if possible understand a small tract published under the direction of the society as it is called for carrying into effect the kings proclamation since the following pages were prepared for the press has not appeared to supersede the present attempt of former publications on the subject it may be sufficient to observe that all or most of them have been looked into  the language however is generally that of the authority quoted and the books referred to which it may be occasionally necessary to consult are to be found in many booksellers shops and in the libraries of the four law societies few barristers at the same time are without all or most of them and some justices of peace it is presumed may possess the statutes at large it is undoubtedly a serious consideration that the persons and property of almost all but professional men should be subjected to laws which they are totally ignorant of and do not even know where to find or how unless by dearbought and fatal experience to get acquainted with and of which the mere study is sufficient employment for the best part if not the whole of a long life these statutes at large which while they preserve many acts that are not and many more that ought not to be in force do not contain above half the number that are actually so the private and local acts every where in force and no where to be met with are at least as numerous how is this exclaimed a lawyer one day why all these proceedings of yours are manifestly illegal contrary to magna charta to the bill of rights to the liberty of the subject to  sir says his client who was a churchwarden we have got an act of parliament and thus it is every little dirty parish in the environs of london must have a law for itself the churchwardens or overseers can provide the money the attorney wants a job the justice looks forward to the penalties and the gemmen of the westry like authority an act of parliament is accordingly obtained and being an admirable compound of ignorance and knavery cannot fail of proving exceedingly beneficial to the community to the statutes which are not and ought not to be in force may be added those which are altogether doubtful and till they come in question cannot be positively said either to be in force or not the drawer of a modern act of parliament seldom troubles himself about former laws on the same subject he erects the new house and leaves the old one standing it is a wellknown observation of a grave and learned sergeant that an act of parliament was much wanted to repeal all the laws made for thirty years past this to be sure would be pretty well but a retrospect of two or three hundred would be infinitely better lord coke complains bitterly of the injudicious penners of acts of parliament in his time overladen as he says  with provisoes and additions and many times on a sudden penned or corrected by men of none or very little judgment in law those acts however which gave such just offense to this truly learned and eminent lawyer will appear perspicuous as light and brief as womans love when compared with the endless and inextricable parliamentary labyrinths of the present century see also   black com  0  are comprised in no less than sixteen closely printed quarto volumes the common law is dispersed through near two hundred folios exclusive of every other size many of which exist only in a barbarous gibberish peculiar to the profession it was long since objected as a fault to the professors of the law that they wrote their reports and books of the law in a strange and unknown tongue which none could understand but themselves to the end that people being kept in ignorance of the law might the more admire their skill and knowledge and esteem and value it at a higher price preface to sir john daviss reports published in       even a very imperfect abridgement of it filling no less than twentyfour this however is a complaint which has been so frequently and so ineffectually made bishop burnet near a century ago pronounced the law the greatest grievance of the nation and the great lord bacon who complains that the laws were then subject to great incertainties and variety of opinions delays and evasions delivered a formal proposition to king james i for their amendment and this at a time when the statutes were in two volumes and beside the year books there were but four reporters extant  that one must have patience till the mischief every day increasing shall remedy itself till in short there is a drop too much  sir william blackstone observes that considering what manner of men are for the most part out into the office of constable it is perhaps very well that they are generally kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers   com      an observation to which it may be readily conceived the compiler of the following digest does not subscribe in fact he has ever regarded it as equally sarcastic illiberal and unbecoming and only to be accounted for by the professional character and habits of the writer who doubtless thought that law like religion being a mystery the scriptures should in both cases be locked up in an unknown language or unintelligible jargon   com     and benthams fragment of government preface p xxxv  that the profane ought to know no more than the initiated may think fit to communicate and that in short the most ignorant are the most tractable and consequently the fittest for good christians and good subjects if the powers which the law has vested in the constable be so large that it is even dangerous he should know them why were they given him why are they not taken away why is he to be punished for neglecting duties of which it is best he should be ignorant would it not be full as well considering what manner of men are for the most part put into the office of justice of peace if they too were to be kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers this indeed it may be is already the case though they do not on that account seem the less inclined to abuse them but wherefor is it that such manner of men are put into the office of constable because upward of a hundred acts of parliament which few ever see and still fewer comprehend the emperor caligula it is said caused his laws to be written so small and placed so high that though all might clearly see none could possibly read the english law is thought by some to bear in many instances a great resemblance to the roman and it seems a maxim in both that ignorantia legis non excusat others have not hesitated to say that british statutes resemble cobwebs placed in darkness and obscurity for the purpose of entrapping the smaller flies in order to glut the bottledspiders of westminster hall with their blood but these no doubt are the ravings of beggered suitors and consequently not to be regarded  added to the arbitrary and capricious decisions of some courts and the ignorance and innovation of others have redered it so burdensome servile vexatious and expensive that they who possess or usurp the power of filling it select those who have nothing to recommend them but the willingness with which they receive the yoke and the patience with which they bear it the reason given for this partiality is that no gentleman can accept such an office poverty both in purse and in spirit being looked upon as the proper qualification for a constable these same gentlemen it should seem are highmettled horses who would kick and wince and play the devil in short if you attempted to put them in the shafts the vulgar are asses who tamely submit to every indignity but gentleman or no gentleman he who can best afford to lose his time and money who has spirit and ability to sustain fatigue and resolution to oppose insult and oppression is the fittest person to discharge the office of constable to confer it from whatever motive upon people of base or inferior condition was long ago reprobated by lord bacon as a mere abuse or degenerating from the first institution law tracts      and certainly the necessity of a man who depends upon his daily employment for the daily bread of himself and his family and whose time is of course the most precious ought to be a sufficient excuse in any court of justice why he should not be compelled to serve this office only it would probably cost him more to obtain the determination than he can value his time at it is doubtless a very scandalous insinuation that justices of peace who have some how or other acquired the power of making constables select the meanest and most ignorant by way of magnifying their own wisdom and consequence gems it is well known which require no foil to increase their luster  it is by no means a less abuse when a person every way fit for the office is pitched upon to admit in his stead any worthless fellow that he can procure base enough to serve the duty for a few guineas what integrity or propriety of conduct can be expected from one whose necessity renders every shilling that is offered him an irresistible temptation the great shakspeare has satirised this practice with admirable pleasantry in his play of measure for measure where he introduces the character of a foolish substitute bringing a charge before one of the dukes deputies  escalus come hither to me master elbow come hither master constable how long have you been in this place of constable  elbow seven years and a half sir  esca i thought by your readiness in the office you had continued in it some time  alas it has been great pains to you they do you wrong to put you so often upon it are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it  elbow faith sir few of any wit in such matters as they are chosen they are glad to choose me for them i do it for some piece of money and go through with all there is another not overwise constable in the comedy of much ado about nothing and again in that of loves labor lost it is to be hoped such a character is not so very common now a days   if the preservation of peace and good order be the interest of society the legislature would essentially contribute to that end in extending more effectual protection and encouragement to the constable this would be done by causing all the laws which authorize or oblige him to do particular acts or any way concern the execution of his office to be reduced into a single statute conceived in plain intelligible language a resolution of all the judges would answer the same purpose something of this kind it is true was formerly attempted by a chief justice but being hastily carelessly and every way badly done was deservedly rejected by his brethren  and by requiring every court at the election of a constable to put a copy of it into his hands in order that having his power and duty constantly under his eye he might be without excuse in neglecting the one and without danger in exercising the other if it be true that every man who serves the public ought to be paid by the public it is most unreasonable and unjust that a duty should be imposed upon any one which if attended to as it ought to be would demand the greatest part of his time not only without making him the slightest recompense but even obliging him to be at what is to him a considerable expense for even the mere consumption of time to him who lives by the sale of his time is equivalent to expense suppose therefore that every person duly elected a constable were during his continuance in office not exceeding one year exempt from all taxes and impositions parliamentary or local and in case of actions against him touching his office the dread of which is one great obstacle to its due execution should be allowed to defend not in forma pauperis but some really unexpensive mode the defense of actions by an innocent man requires the fortune of a rich one even a pauper who is to swear himself not worth five pounds in the world will have to provide ten or possibly fifty times that sum to prosecute or defend his suit this if not an adequate compensation would be a great relief and in some cases at least an indemnity to persons serving the office would induce them to accept it with cheerfulness and execute it with spirit conscious that in so doing they were benefiting society without injuring themselves in some parts of the north the constable is entitled to an ancient cess charged upon certain lands which has formerly amounted to a pretty considerable sum  one cannot however have the satisfaction to think that a suggestion so advantageous both to the community and to the individual stands the least chance of ever passing into a law if indeed the proposal were for a productive tax upon constables or for the purpose of making bad worse or of heaping oppression upon the oppressed there would be little fear of its being adopted this therefore is another of those selfreforming grievances which must be patiently suffered to attain their worst state  to conclude if the following pages prove at all instrumental toward making a single constable more active confident and secure in the discharge of such of the powers and duties of his office as are any way beneficial to society for the less he attends to the others the better the compiler will have reason to flatter himself that his efforts though humble have not been useless  errata p xxii for ordnance read ordinance p   for   mod    read   mod    for freeman     read    mod     p   after styles

introduction   the origin of the word constable which some etymologists have erroneously sought for in the saxon language see lambard sir t smith and others  is undoubtedly to be found in the comes stabuli of the eastern empire hence the constabularius constabulus etc of barbarous latinity the connestable of the french the conestabile of the italians and see spelmans glossary voce constabulariu this comes stabuli was at first as his title imports no more than prefect or superintendant of the imperial stables or in other words the emperors master of the horse but having in process of time obtained the command of the army his name corrupted into constabulus and constabularius began to signify a commander and with this signification appears to have been introduced into england at the norman conquest or perhaps sooner since in fact some such officer seems to have been already known under the title of stallarius    the constable or lord high constable of england was an officer of the highest dignity and importance in the realm he was the leader of the kings armies and had the cognizance of all contracts and other matters touching arms or war    r z st   c   see also madoxs history of the exchequer p    etc  this office which appears to have been granted by william the conqueror to walter earl of gloucester or according to others to william fitzosbern or roger de mortimer became afterward hereditary in two different families as annexed to the earldom of hereford and in that right after a lapse of near two centuries several persons enjoying the title and authority in the mean time was revived by judgment of law in the person of edward stafford duke of buckingham but henry viii thinking the office too high and dangerous for the hands of a subject took the first opportunity of putting an end to it by cutting off his head since this period there has been no lord high constable except pro hac vice as robert earl of lindsey was appointed in      to determine the appeal of lord rea against ramsey and as some person or other is created at the coronation of a king or queen    we had also constables of castles that is keepers or governors so called of the castles of the king or great barons whom the french term chatellains from the latin castellani and who were frequently hereditary and by feudal tenure such were the constable of the tower the constable of london or baynardscastle the constables of the castles of dover windsor chester flint etc some of which offices though not now hereditary are remaining to this day these are the constables intended in magna charta cc     0 and who in the statute of westminster the first   e   c    are called constables of sees and there considered as keepers of prisons a constituent part indeed of all ancient castles lord coke observes that before magna charta these constables of castles had the like authority within their precincts as the sheriff had within his bailiwick and commonly sealed with their portraiture on horseback   inst    see also w   c     the statute of   h   c  0 which recites that by color of their commissions as justices of the peace they took people to whom they bore evil will and imprisoned them in their castles till they made fine and ransom for their deliverance and ordains that none be imprisoned but in the common jail seems to have put an end to a race of tyrants so odious to the people as to be usually represented in romances under the character of monstrous giants who not content with the property would eat the flesh drink the blood and grind the bones of the unwary and unfortunate traveler    there was likewise formerly a constable of the exchequer of whom we may read in the dialogus scaccarii l   c   in the statute de districtione scaccarii    h   st   in fleta l   c    and in madoxs history of that court p     etc we also find mention made in some old statutes of the constable of the staple see    e   c      r   c      h   c      we now come to the constable of the hundred or high chief or head constable as he is otherwise called of whom we shall have a little more to say by the statute of wynton or winchester    e   c   it is ordained that in every hundred or franchise there shall be chosen two constables to make the view of armor as directed in the preceding part of the chapter and that the constables aforesaid shall present before the justices assigned the defaults of armor and of the suits of towns and of highways and shall also present those who harbor strangers in upland towns for whom they will not answer they are likewise to present sheriffs or bailiffs who do not follow the cry of the county  it is agreed by mr lamberd on constables    by sir edward coke   inst      and by sir matthew hale   p c     that constables of the hundred were first introduced by this statute and though fitzherbert j p     b  and crompton after him j p  0  b  have asserted that they were conservators of the peace at the common law and though it is said in other books that notwithstanding the opinions to the contrary the high constable was an officer at the common law and that the statute of wynton only enlarged his authority   keble     salk            mod     l rav            yet no one has hitherto produced the least evidence in support of such assertion on the other hand beside the authority of coke and hale it has been expressly held from the bench that a high constable is not such an officer nor conservator of the peace whereof the common law takes any notice that he is not mentioned in any book and that in fine he is only by custom and for conformity cro eliz     where it is said that in the north they had no high constables which appears from nordens description p  0 to be the case in cornwall  it must be confessed that the first mention made of the high constable in any statute subsequent to that already cited is by   e   c   he afterward occurs in    h   c       h   c       h   c  0 etc and though sir william blackstone has in one place attempted to carry up his antiquity as high as king henry ii   com     the praepositus hundredi whom the learned author has mistaken for the high constable seems to have been the bailiff of the hundred as praepositus comitatus is the sheriff and praepositus manerii the bailiff or reve of the manor vide spelman in voce the praepositus hundredi is frequently mentioned in domesday book he in another expressly mentions him to have been first ordained by the statute of winchester   com      after all however nothing can be more certain than that the constable of the hundred or high constable whether he be allowed an officer at the common law or not was instituted long before that statute this curious fact is ascertained by a writ or mandate of the   th year of king henry iii preserved in the adversaria to watss edition of matthew paris and from which chapters   and   of the statute of wynton are evidently taken though it has hitherto escaped the notice of every writer or speaker upon the subject by this writ it is provided that in every hundred there should be constituted a chief constable at whose mandate all those of his hundred sworn to arms  i e to have such arms according to the quantity of their lands or chattels as there directed should assemble and be observant to him for the doing of those things which belong to the conservation of the kings peace in singulis vero hundredis constituatur unus capitalis constabularius ad cujus mandatum omnet jurati ad arma de hundredis suis conveniant and cis sint intendentes ad faciendum ea quae spectant ad conservationem pacis nostrae  no mention it is believed of this officer can be any where found prior to the date of this instrument which however it may be contended no more determines the question as to his original creation than the statute of wynton appeared to do the language in both cases being imperative and the only difference consisting in the word eleus chosen for constituatur constituted be this as it will the discovery ought at least to teach not antiquaries alone but even lawyers and judges to look a little into matter of record and trust less to opinion which ought no more to be law upon the bench than it is off it    the constable of the vill or petty constable as to distinguish him from the constable of the hundred he is frequently called has been repeatedly acknowleged by the law to be one of the most ancient officers in the realm for the conservation of the peace popham    and below p    and is declared by lord coke to be as ancient as torns or leets be and not to have begun about the beginning of e   as some have supposed   inst     his lordship here alludes to the opinion of mr lambard who says about the beginning of the reign of k ed   petty constables were devised in towns and parishes for the aid of the constables of the hundred an opinion which certainly detracts from the character of mr lambard as an industrious or judicious antiquary lord bacon on the contrary who allows the great antiquity of petty constables doubts that the high constable was not ab origin and only introduced for convenience sake when the authority of the justices of the peace who did not exist before the first year of edw   was enlarged by diverse statutes law tracts     an idea equally erroneous  it must be confessed however that no mention of him by this identical name is any where found to occur anterior to the writ or mandate already mentioned of king henry iii whereby it is provided that in every villate or township there should be constituted a constable or two according to the number of the inhabitants in singulis vero villatis aliis constituatur unus constabularius vel duo secundum numerum inhabitantium and provisionem praedictorum  it is nevertheless pretty certain that lord cokes idea is right and that this officer is actually owing to the institution of the frankpledge usually attributed to king alfred and was in fact originally the senior or chief pledge of the tithing or decenna in support of this position we may observe that the constable or an officer resembling him is in many places at this very day called the headborough tithingman or borsholder all names belonging to the chief pledge and to be found in numerous statutes in company with and as synonimous to constable see    h c  0 now repealed in which we have likewise a thirdborough see also sir t smith commonwealth of england     and lambard on constables passim  that the statute of   e   c   in which the name of this constable first occurs the words are burghaldres conestables et gardens de la pees and lastly that in the stat of  0 h   c    the constables tithingmen and chief pledges of every town are required to aid the venders of goods in disputes with the kings purveyors it was therefore rightly adjudged in b r    c   that  decennarius prima facie is the same with a constable and differed little in the execution of that office though hale who has elsewhere told us all he knew about the matter said he was not the same officer   ven   0 it should seem indeed from lambard and others that where there is a constable as well as a tythingman headborough or thirdborough in one and the same place the office of the latter is inferior to that of constable in shakspeares comedy of much ado about nothing two of the characters are a constable and a headborough but though it is sufficiently evident that master dogherry the constable takes a great deal more upon him than his comptner yet as he supposes himself by much the wiser man it is not perfectly clear that he was invested with any greater degree of authority it is allowed however that where there is only a headborough thirdborough or tythingman his office does not at all differ from that of constable one is therefore at a loss to conceive why the court gould j should on the trial of power for murder o b sep      ask one of the witnesses what are you a constable or a headborough  a i am headborough of aldgate was there any constable in the passage at that time  a there was not since the arrest being illegal for want of a warrant it could make no difference what he was nor whether any constable supposing aldgate had both constable and headborough were present or not sly the drunken tinker in the taming of the shrow is threatened by his hostess with the thirdborough and the term not being familiar to the london editors got corrupted into headborough which is evidently incongruous and absurd  third or fourth or fifth borough says he i will answer him by law in loves labor lost goodman dall says he reprehends the duke own person and calls himself his graces tharborough norden in his description of cornwell p  0 tells us that tythinges have therdbarows in some places hedborows in some borrowsheds and in the weste parts a tything man and ben jonson in his tale of a tub introduces the high constable of kentishtown the headborough of islington the petty constable of hamstead the thirdborough of belsise and the high constables man this thirdborough is supposed by blount a corruption of the saxn freoborg or freepledge but if one may be allowed the conjecture it s not improbable that as the headborough or chief pledge was the first man of the ten or decenna and had the sqr authority so the first man of each of the rmaining threes that is the first fourth and seventh of the nine might have had some subordinate jurisdiction as his assistants and hence receive the name of thirdboroughs the common pledges were called handbarrows  it therefore follows that the above ordnance of hen iii far from instituting the office merely enlarged the number of officers placing them in towns and villages instead of franchises since it might frequently happen that a manor of great extent had only a single constable for several townships a case exactly similar indeed sometimes occurring at this day where a township comprehending several hamlets equally populous it may be with itself has only one constable for the whole the book of villaum in the exchquer sets out all the vills and there cannot be a constablewick created at this lay unless by act of parliament   md     we find the constable beginning to be familiarly known by that name in the time of king edward i though it is not a little extraordinary that not to mention bracton who wrote toward the end of the reign of henry iii there should not be a word about him in either britton he seems to mean constables in chap    by gardens de villes or the mirror and that he should be only incidentally named by the author of fleta he is supposed to have been one of king edward the firsts judges and by him committed to the fleet britton also is thought to have been a judge if not a bishop in the time of the same prince the mirror was compiled by one horn citizen and chamberlain of london in the reign of edward the second who has express chapters on the different and most inferior ministers of the law in his time in certain articles of inquiry at the air perhaps or trailbaston certainly in the time of edward i coll madox mus iii     are the following items de ceus ke sunt conestables de vills ou baylifs le roy ke unt lor garsouns ovek eus de atacher les felouns e il les fount garnir avaunt par quey lez comandemens le

constables of vills or bailiffs or other ministers that they cannot do their office as they are charged by the king for keeping the peace of his realm    he seems also to be meant by the two following

chronicles but none of them has been found to make any mention of the constable  he is named in the statute of   e   c   already mentioned for the first time and in those of   e   c  0   e   c       e

following lines which may serve to give us some imperfect idea how he was considered in the time of that writer  i e about the year    0  the king swore by christ and by his crown both that wrong for his works should woo thoroughly and commanded a constable to cast him in yrons and set him not these seven years see his fete once fo xviii b  this passage is the rather curious as we do not elsewhere find that the constable had any power to put people in irons much less to detain them for so considerable a length of time possibly however it is to be understood of the constable or keeper of a castle before mentioned although in must be confessed that the expression would in this case have been more accurately the constable since there could not well be more than one such officer attending the court    notwithstanding any thing that has been said or omitted in the course of this enquiry it seems highly probable that at the common law and before the mandate of henry iii the constable of the hundred and the constable of the manor were officers of the same nature and authority originating at the same time and differing only as to the extent of their several districts in short that they bore to each other the same analogy as subsisted between the bailiff of the hundred and the bailiff of the manor and consequently that the local jurisdiction of the constable of the hundred was commensurate with that of the torn or leet at which he was elected being such part of the division only as was not comprehended within the jurisdiction of any other leet it follows therefore that the constable of the hundred neither possessed nor could have exercised any more authority within the precinct of the leet than the constable of one manor possessed or could have exercised in another the manor being to all intents and purposes exempt from and excluded out of the hundred see   inst     it should hence seem that at this day a warrant directed to all constables generally cannot be legally executed by the high constable within the limits of any petty constablery  the preeminence therefore which the constable of the hundred is supposed to have or may think proper to assume over the constables of manors or townships within the hundred is altogether unfounded and imaginary and might with equal justice or propriety be claimed by the bailiff of the hundred or sheriff of the county over the bailiff of the manor or in short by any one constable over another whose district was more circumscribed for though as lord bacon observes the high constables authority has the more ample circuit yet i do not find says he that the petty constable is subordinate to the high constable or to be ordered or commanded by him law tracts         those cases therefore wherein it has been adjudged that the being subject to a particular leet shall not excuse a man from serving the office of constable of the hundred seem to have been decided upon a wrong principle and to use an expression of sir edward coke for want of the knowledge of antiquity   keble      0     freeman       mod       all this however is spoken with an exception not of acts of parliament only which tinkerlike for one flaw they pretend to remedy make a hundred to offer advice to the legislature may be a presumptuous but is certainly a useless measure it would however lessen the mischief which almost every act of parliament unintentionally does if a general saving or proviso were introduced as is usual in private acts whereby every right law or custom not expressly taken away or altered by such act should continue in force  but also of the powers and pretensions exercised or asserted by the quarter sessions which being generally composed of men who neither know nor care what the law is and who therefore consider themselves as a sort of legislative body and at liberty to do whatever they please  finding it perhaps much easier to make new laws than to become acquainted with those already made  has in direct opposition to a positive rule of law that a court created by act of parliament cannot prescribe nor exercise any authority which is not thereby expressly given to them how

magistrate of each he passes through whoever carries the warrant to be last indorsed and by virtue thereof apprehends the offender must personally carry either the prisoner or his recognizance back to

    nor appointed to be the officer to execute the warrants yet the justices may command him to execute them the reason given is that as at common law the constables were subordinate officers to the conservators of the peace so they are now the proper officers of the justices but the premises are false and of course the conclusion bad they were conservators of the peace themselves   presentiments a constable must either return his warrant   salk     or certify what he has done upon it he ought not to return the warrant but keep it for his own justification  see    g   c      he should present all offenses within his own knowledge dalton j p     fitz j p   which concern the peace as defaults of watching disorderly houses affrays etc etc at the leet tourn or quarter sessions and such presentment is as available as one made by twelve men  but he is not obliged to present a highway sworn before him by two witnesses to be out of repair   vent     even though demanded so to do by the quarter sessions and may tell them plainly that he will not present it n b although it be said in the pamphlet entitled the duty of constables etc gloucester    0 that they as well as other parish officers are to take care as much as in them lies that the sabbath be not profaned the constable is no more concerned in preventing such profanation except in levying the penalty or inflicting punishment under the justices warrant than any other person and as that part of the act    c   c   which makes it penal for a man to exercise his trade or calling on what is called the lords day savours a little too much of bigotry and calvinism it will be most commendable and perhaps most advisable if he in all such cases wait for the warrant what is innocent one day cannot well be criminal another   discharge he is not discharged of his office till his successor be sworn freeman     because the district cannot be without an officer  chap vi of his protection indemnity allowances advantages and rewards aid of the country the constable shall have aid of the country to pacify affray cromp j p     constables are usually summoned by the sheriff to attend at the quarter sessions and assizes to make presentiments etc which though not warranted by any express law must be allowed a very ancient usage but the following practice seems to be perfectly unjustifiable the grand inquest for the county of middlesex previous to their sitting and before they are sworn issue a warrant under their hands and seals to the high constable commanding him to summon the petty constables who on making default are presented by the inquest and compelled to appear to the presentment in the crown office and take a copy of it which is attended with an expense of between  0 and  0 shillings and here the proceedings uniformly stop and this is done every term but surely without the privity of the court of kings bench which can never sanction so illegal and oppressive a conduct no grand jury has the least power by law to require the attendance of a single person for any purpose whatever even after it is sworn and yet here is one which assumes that power even before it exists the warrant is sent to the high constable who is no officer of the court of the kings bench and has no business to obey it and yet if any one thus irregularly called upon does not appear he will be subject to the above fine in the crownoffice for though the court would doubtless quash the presentment yet the getting it quashed would cost him a great deal more he is therefore obliged to submit to an unconstitutional and oppressive measure because the remedy is worse than the disease see the warrant in the complete constable      p     if it be necessary for the constables to make their presentiments to the grand inquest the court of kings bench should issue its writ for that purpose to the sheriff   action he is not suable out of the county for what he does in the execution of his

deputy constable  but in this case the judge who tries the cause must order the postea to be marked   ven    douglas     and certify that the defendant was acting in the execution of his office  murder if in the execution of his office   hale pc     0 after competent notice that he is constable he or any that come to his assistance be killed it is murder although the party killing do not know his person but then as has been already observed he must be acting in his own district or division for if the constable of a come into the vill of b to suppress any disorder and in the tumult be killed this is only manslaughter because he had no authority in b   hale p c     the constable of st margarets parish in westminster having a search warrant directed to the constables of that parish came into the parish of st paul covent garden and took a woman in the street near the theater and carried her to the roundhouse where he was assaulted and killed by some who wanted to rescue her and this killing adjudged only manslaughter   because it was a sudden action without precedent malice   because the constable had no authority at all in covent garden nor supposing he had any was the woman guilty of any disorderly act and it is not a constables suspecting that will justify his taking up any person but it must be just grounds of suspicion and it would be hard that the liberty of the subject should depend on the will of the constable or his not liking a womans looks be any cause of suspicion   the prisoners had a sufficient provocation for it one be imprisoned upon an unlawful authority it is a sufficient provocation to all people out of compassion much more when it is done under a color of justice and where the liberty of the subject is invaded it is a provocation to all the subjects in england by holt c j   l ray   00   0   there are other instances of a constable or his assistant being killed where he has been too officiously or imprudently because ignorantly acting as such and exercising an authority not given him by law which of course will in such case afford him no more protection than a common man see the trial of william power for the wilful murder of john wilkinson sessions paper       p   0 where gould j having consulted two of his brethren in directing the jury said the thing being over it was unwarrantable in these people to seize this man thus quiet without having an authority from a justice of peace he was therefore illegally assaulted and arrested by these men when a man therefore is deprived of his liberty and does an act that causes the death of the assailant in any manner whatever certainly by law it reduces the offense to manslaughter and so of course the jury found the deceased had sent for the constable and given him charge of the prisoner for having drawn a knife on him twice and threatening his life and in helping the constable to force him away was unfortunately stabbed see also leaches cases in crown law     these little accidents should operate to make every constable more familiar with his actual powers which wherever there may be danger he ought always for his greater security to execute with sufficient assistance or properly armed since the hanging of his murderer though it be all the law can do will hardly restore him to life or recompense his family for his loss let him therefore learn to protect himself and let others also when he is usurping an illegal authority be taught to protect themselves against him  at present by    g   c    the westminster constables are to be appointed out of the different parishes for the whole city and liberty in london also by ancient custom the constables though appointed in particular wards of which there are twentysix have power to serve warrants and execute their office throughout the city     notice coming to appease a sudden affray in the daytime in the place where he is constable   hale p c     it seems every man is bound to take notice that he is constable but it is not so in the nightime unless there be some notification that he is constable but whether it be day or night it is sufficient notice if he declare himself to be the constable or command the peace to be kept in the kings name or the like  trespas if two men are combating cromp j p   0 and the constable come to part them and is hurt he shall have action of trespass and if he hurt them they shall not have action against him   hale p c    and so of those who aid him every man who is assisting to the constable in the execution of his office having the same protection that the law gives to the constable  unjustly removed if he be removed without just cause bulstr     the court of kings bench will by rule of court order him to be restored to his place  cursing and swearing if he be sued for seizing or prosecuting persons who swear or curse in his hearing    g   c    he may plead the general issue and give the special matter in evidence and if he get a verdict or plaintiff be nonsuit or discontinue he is to have treble costs  warrant a justice of peces warrant is a sufficient justification of a constable in a matter within the jurisdiction of such justice strange       action no action shall be brought against a constable    g   c    or any one acting by his order or in his aid for any thing done in obedience to a warrant under the hand or seal of a justice of peace until demand of the perusal and copy of such warrant and refusal or neglect for six days and if after demand and compliance an action be brought without making the justice a defendant the jury shall give a verdict for the defendant or defendants notwithstanding any defect of jurisdiction in such justice and if such action be brought jointly against justice and constable the jury on proof of the warrant shall find for the latter and no action shall be brought against a constable unless commenced within six months note the above act extends only to actions of tort and therefore where an action for money had and received was brought against an officer who had levied money on a conviction by a justice of the peace the conviction having been quashed it was holden that a demand of a copy of the warrant was not necessary bullers n p    and although this act may afford the constable protection in a civil suit yet if the warrant be plainly illegal as for instance to apprehend a man for adultery or incest it seems the party may legally resist and if in defense of his liberty he kill the constable such killing is not murder but if on the other hand the constable should kill him he shall be adjudged guilty of murder  of the above description perhaps are the warrants put into the hands of an uninformed constable who supposes every thing to be legal which comes from a justice of peace who may possibly at the same time be as ignorant as himself for the searching after and impressing of seamen a practice in direct violation of every constitutional principle and certainly unsupported by any positive law let the constable therefore who too officiously engages in a business so deservedly unpopular seriously reflect of the risk he runs let him dread the consequences of a spirited resistance he murders if he kill it is justifiable homicide or at most manslaughter if he be killed the law very properly encourages and invites all men to repress an act of illegality and violence and the rather as we have just seen if it be done under color of justice see the case already cited in lord raymonds reports and that of hopkins hugget in sir john kelyngs cases of much greater consequence and authority than the flimsy reasoning used in defense of presswarrants observe also what is said by lord hale on this subject in his history of the pleas of the crown and consider whether the life liberty and happiness of the subject are to be blown away by an insidious sidewinded act of parliament it is no place here to enter into a discussion of the arguments used by sir michael forster and mr butler on this subject which however might be easily refuted upon the most solid and legal as well as constitutional principles the practice is very far

collector of the poors rate during his office the high constable as has been elsewhere mentioned is generally but ignorantly supposed to have and in fact frequently found to assume a degree of

issue his precepts to the constables who are subjected to a penalty for disobeying them yet even this gives him no authority his office being simply ministerial and in all cases where the justices make out such general warrant not being empowered thereto by express statute it is conceived that the constables in disobeying the precepts of the constable of the hundred are not liable to punishment

name or style of this court name as formally entered in its own proceedings is the court leet and view of frankpledge the word leet  which it is very remarkable is to be found neither in the saxon law

the saxon leoth plebs and to mean the populi curia or folk mote as the sheriffs tourn or leet of the county at least appears to have been once actually called spelman v folkesmote kennets parochial antiquities glos v falmote  in contradistinction perhaps to the halmote or court baron which consisted of the free tenants only who being few in number might conveniently assemble in the lords hall whereas the leet which required the attendance of all the refiants and concerned the administration of public justice was as there will be hereafter occasion to mention usually held in the open air the view of frankpledge visus franciplegii means the examination or survey of the freepledges of which every man not particularly privileged was anciently obliged to have nine who were bound that he should be always forthcoming to answer any complaint the better to understand this we are to be informed that the kingdom being divided into countys or shires and each county into hundreds and each hundred into tithings each tithing containing ten families or households the heads of these families were reciprocally bound and responsible for each other so that in fact of every ten householders throughout the kingdom each man had nine pledges or sureties for his good behavior of these pledges the eldest or most respectable and first sworn was called the headborough or chief pledge and had a degree of authority over the rest not now exactly ascertained it was however in all probability much the same with that of the constable who was formerly a character of great consequence and is to this day in many places called the headborough a word which according to sir william blackstone too implicitly following sir thomas smith bespeaks its own etymology and means the discreetest person in the borough great lawyers however are sometimes indifferent etymologists the word in fact implys nothing more or less than the chief pledge from borg borh or borhoe fidejussor a pledge or surety he was also called the borsalder borges alder  i e the eldest of the pledges and the tithing man both tithing man and borsholder are to be found in modern statutes as synonimous with constable and headborough but at what period the constable became a distinct officer and the chief pledges were metamorphosed into a grand jury is a point which must be left to a more successful enquirer  this is the famous system of king alfred so much applauded by both ancient and modern writers which produced such singular effects among a barbarous and disorderly people that a man might have hung his purse by the side of a public road and found it untouched a month after or might have ridden with much treasure and no other weapon than a white wand from one end of the kingdom to the other ingulphus w

the sheriffs tourn is not entitled to any particular notice being a mere unsupported dictum to which neither lord cokes adoption   inst    nor that of lord mansfield   bur    0 can add any weight much matter and many authorities must be sacrificed throughout this little enquiry for the sake of brevity as to the rest the word leet though generally appropriated to the court of a manor has in fact nothing essentially distinct from the tourn but the being upon a smaller scale see however britton c       e       e   c   those writers therefore who suppose the leet of a hundred or manor inferior to or subject to the control of the tourn or leet of the county are egregiously mistaken the jurisdiction of the latter being confined to so much of the county or hundred as is not comprised within the precinct of the manor see   inst     it is indeed repeatedly said in our old books that things of which the leet of a manor that is omits to enquire shall be enquired of in the tourn which may well be and the reason is that the lord has forfeited his leet for the time quoad the particular object it being very clear that when the leet of a manor is by any means lost the resiants owe suit to the tourn and that although they should be within a hundred in the hands of a private person   iii nature the leet is a court of record for the cognizance of criminal matters or pleas of the crown and

still extant of the criminal part of the constitution before the conquest and probably for some time after this court of the leet was if not the sole at least the most usual dispensary of criminal justice in the kingdom no crime in those remote ages appears to have been punished by death unless it were that of open theft where the offender was taken with the mainour that is with the thing stolen upon him  and of this crime and this only the cognizance did not belong to the leet the elucidation of this circumstance would form a curious if not an interesting article but could not be easily compressed within the compass of a note and in fact belongs more properly to a different work all other offenses of what nature or degree soever subjected the party to a mulct or pecuniary fine which was in many cases determinate and fixed for two hundred shillings observes an ingenious writer you might have killed a peasant for six times as much a nobleman for sixandthirty times as much you might have killed the king a king in those days was worth exactly   00 shillings benthams introduction p clxxvi it should be observed however that the king valued himself friend panurge did not think king anarchus worth quite so much when he made him a crier of green sauce  this pecuniary composition with respect to certain capital offenses was abrogated and the punishment of death substituted in its place by k henry i spelman v felo wilkins ll sax  0  in fact there is a ordinance to this effect among the laws of canute william the conqueror considering punishment by death as too lenient and merciful ordered offenders to be mutilated eruantur oculi and abscindantur pedes vel testiculae vel manus etc neither does the law of henry i appear to have been invariably observed if indeed it were

the kings peace broken homicide arson robbery rape forgery and the like adds which crimes are punished by death ultimo supplicio or mutilation memboum truncatione l   c   how far this alteration might affect the leet we are not now able to discover but it is not improbable that the distinction of indictments for felonies and presentiments of inferior offenses owes its origin to the above measure it is still doubtful however what became of a person indicted at the leet for a capital offense before the introduction of the petty jury as it is now called in the reign of edward i or henry iii this second jury was originally and for many years considered merely as witnesses see an excellent account of this institution in the valuable work just quoted  as it should seem that supposing an indictment positively affirming such a one to have committed a capital crime had been returned to the kings justices at the iter or jail delivery dr hickes thought that justices itinerant were originally instituted by henry ii  dis epis p      but mr madox has produced evidence of their existence in the reign of king stephen hist ex p  00 the punishment must have been awarded without further process or any plea traverse or answer from the party of course that they had nothing to do but to pronounce sentence of death a presentment of any fact upon the oath of twelve men judicially appointed to enquire thereof being always conclusive by the ancient law as indeed it is in many cases particularly with respect to offenses of which the enquiry as well as the punishment still belongs to the leet at this day in aid of eyres says the mirror are turns of sheriffs necessary and views of frankpledge and when that good men at such inquests indicted any of mortal sin kings used to destroy them without answer which usages still remain in germany but by warrant of pity and of mercy and for that the frailty of man cannot be held from sining it is accorded that no one appealed or indicted be destroyed without answer c   f   the more general mode however of proceeding against criminals was by appeal the consequence of which was either duel or purgation if a freeman by fire per ferrum callidum or if a rustic by water death or mutilation and banishment awaiting the unsuccessful and it must be confessed that by constitutions of clarendon to which it is possible the mirror may allude it should seem as if the party indicted by the inquest of a leet would have been subjected to the same purgation wilkins ll sax c   0 hist of the english law i     see also glanville l   cc     the subject which is singularly perplexed and obscure both demands and deserves the most copious and minute investigation from the learned and sagacious antiquary but this is not the age of a spelman a seldom or a hickes   it has been said by sir edward coke and repeated by the noble judge already mentioned that by the clause nullus vicecomes etc in the great charter no sheriff constable coroner or other our bailiffs shall hold pleas of our crown c    and whether they did so became an article of enquiry at the air and yet in a writ issued in    h   for the interpretation of another clause in this charter it is expressly admitted that pleas of the crown might be held at the hundred and wapentake courts  nisi ita sit quod ad hundreda illa et wapentakia fieri debet inquisiti de placitis coronae sicut de morte hominis thesauro invento et hujusmodi prynnes animadversions   0 in short it is very well known that both sheriff and coroner have held pleas of the crown ever since the granting of the great charter and do so at this day it appears however from glanville that the crime of theft at that time belonged wholly to the sheriff and was to be pleaded and determined in the county court and that he had also cognizance of medleys or affrays batteries and wounds unless where the addition was made of the kings peace broken l   c   l   c   these therefore one might think were the plea of the crown taken away by magna charta that is the criminal jurisdiction of the county court if it did not appear both from fleta l   c    and hengham magna c   that such sort of pleas were still held by the sheriff in any case it is nothing to the leet  the jurisdiction of the leet was abridged its power to hear and determine taken away but it has been said and repeated without due attention either to the nature and constitution of the court or to the law of the time no offense it is well known is at this day or for aught that appears ever was heard and determined in the leet  nor before the period refered to by any other criminal court in the kingdom  otherwise than upon the presentment of twelve men  or what we now in most courts call the grand jury this presentment as has been already observed found and established the fact and judgment whether of misericordia mutilation or death followed as an incident or matter of course precisely indeed as the punishment does at this day on the verdict for the king of the petty jury in fact therefore the jurisdiction of the leet was not in the least abridged or affected by that charter nor is it at all probable that the barons would either seek or suffer the diminution of their own privileges of which on the contrary there is an express saving  that this court has no power to enquire of the death of a man or of rape let and hundr  0 br leete     is a more ancient but not less erroneous opinion the contrary is most directly and expressly held in the statutum walliae in britton fleta the mirror and the statute or whatever it is of    ed   all much older and better authorities than the book of assizes    e   pl  0 a doubt is suggested in   h      whether the leet can enquire of high treason and an opinion given in br ley gager    against its power but this as my lord coke observes on a similar occasion happened for want of the knowledge of antiquity see   inst    it is a no less extraordinary dictum in dyer     b that an indictment of assault and battery found in the leet without blood shed is void the principal case being a fine for an assault in disturbance and contempt of the court he might possibly allude to the book case of   e     which by no means supports his doctrine as the plaintiff whose counsel makes that allegation took nothing by his writ  in which that opinion first appears if indeed the reason of the exception be that the enquiry of these two crimes belonged properly to the coroner it may be readily admitted without impeaching the jurisdiction of the leet the coroner took cognizance of death super visum corporis and of rape as well as other offenses by appeal only it follows therefore that in every instance either where he could not or did not act the enquiry must be in the leet otherwise the offender should have escaped without punishment which would be absurd they who suppose rape as a felony to be excepted because it has been made so by act of parliament and allow it to be enquired of as a trespass turn de viscount   let and hundr   br leete    etc etc  seem to have forgot that it is a trespass by act of parliament w     e   c    and a felony at common law vide the following summary in the margin  they should have also recollected the general rule that where a trespass is by statute turned into felony the trespass is merged bullers nisi prius    if indeed the statute of w   operated a an alteration of the common law and was not virtually repealed by that of w      e   st   c    it would seem to follow that rape cannot be enquired of at all in the leet either as felony or trespass   it is indeed unaccountable how such groundless assertions come to be made there is no point better settled than that the steward of a leet may award to prison persons either indicted or accused of felony before him or uilty of any contempt in the face of the court and et lord coke has not hesitated to assert that the leet though a court of record has no power to imprison    rep    b   roll rep        n assertion in which he is positively contradicted by every uthority ancient or modern w   c       h       0 h        h      cromp j p    b owen     possibly however lord coke meant to confine the disability of imprisoning to offenses presented and punishable in the leet which except in the case of bakers etc can only be punished by amerciament the reason whereof is that this court was established long before imprisonment was adopted as a mode of punishment and indeed how far any other court was authorized to inflict it by the common law might have been once a question  these errors are probably owing to the imperfect knowledge judges and lawyers are content to acquire upon certain uprofitable subjects from magna charta to this time says the ate illustrious chief courts leet have been always abridged never enlarged   burr       it is an incontestable fact that the jurisdiction of the leet has been enlarged by several statutes and was never abridged by one it was the same great character who decided in opposition to the united authority of ages see before p xi or rather to the law itself that a presentment in the leet of a common offense is liable to be traversed but in short it seems to have been the leading principle of his long life and continuance on the bench to unsettle that law of which the chief and too often the only merit is its certainty   present state iv though the leet from being principal criminal court in the kingdom is now considered as the owest the greater part of its business having been transfered to other more extended jurisdictions yet it must not be supposed that the power and authority of the court is thereby diminished and gone on the contrary there is no offense which it ever did or could enquire of and punish which it may not equally enquire of and punish at this day that the tourn and the leet have been so long in a declining way is not however at all owing to the cause refered to by a learned writer   black com      i e the discharge granted by the statute of marlbridge in which by the way the leet is not mentioned to all prelates peers and clergymen from their attendance on these courts since the county court and court baron which they are still compellable to attend at least by attorney are scarcely in a more flourishing condition neither is it perfectly clear that experience has shown the wisdom of widening the circle of both civil and criminal jurisdiction   burr       changes may be for the worse as well as for the better true it is that the business of the leet has for the most part gradually devolved upon the quarter sessions   black com      but many reasons may be given for this circumstance much more plausible than those already mentioned in the first place the increased population and more commercial turn of the country and the consequent increase of offenders and offenses required the dispensaries of justice to be if not always at least frequently open whereas the leet is seldom held more than twice and sometimes but once in the year though it may certainly be kept open by adjournment from month to month from week to week or even from day to day secondly the jurisdiction of this court is upon whatever principle confined to offenses at the common law which are become less numerous than those created by act of parliament a third reason may be the steward of a leet seldom resides upon the spot justices of peace on the contrary are every where to be met with and by keeping in a manner open shop make their profession and powers familiar to the people who love to buy law one would think as they do any other commodity the learned commentator is therefore in the right where he reckons the almost entire disuse and contempt of the court leet and sheriffstourn the kings ancient courts of common law formerly he observes much revered and respected among the mischievous effects of the change in the administration of justice by ummary proceedings before justices of the peace   black com      a change which as it places the liberty and property of the subject in the power of a single too often an insolent and oppressive and not unfrequently an interested and corrupt man it is a notorious fact that many of these gentlemen particularly in and about the metropolis act solely for the sake of the emoluments of their office whence the odious appellation of trading justices and though they are sworn to send the fines etc that happen before them to he exchequer for which in certain cases other funds have been sustited by act of parliament it appears from a late enquiry that some of them at least think it better policy to put what they get into their own ockets but one can never believe that men so very honorable keep in pay  gang of vile informers much less that they will now and then convict n innocent man for the sake of the penalty his majestys attorney general should look a little into this business which he undoubtedly will o  if he be well paid for it  as it is destructive of trial per pares trial per pares by ones equals is not only a more ancient but a oe proper phrase than trial by jury as it is by no means necessary in ompliance with a relic whether of christian or of pagan superstition at men should either in this or in any other case e upon oath the iors of the court baron like the peers in parliament are never sworn  and only favorable to a system of tyranny and arbitrary power cannot be sufficiently reprobated  to the circumstances already noticed may be added the practice adopted in the quarter sessions and other superior courts of allowing and trying a traverse to the grand jurys presentment in cases of felony the party is upon his plea of not guilty instantly put upon his trial in misdemeanors he is required to find surety for trying his traverse at the next sessions at his own expense the consequence  which is that if he have neither money nor friends he must remain in j untryed and is of course in a much worse situation than the more heino offender the editor has on such an occasion known the worshipful be persuade the defendant to retract his plea and confess himself guilty and thus enable them to inflict what some might conceive under such circumstances a not very slight or trifling punishment for what in fact was  an indictable matter but then they got rid of an awkward business and such sort of people are seldom known to complain and much seldomer to obtain redress it is indeed frequently an object to be convicted since even the honor of an acquittal as mr bearcroft told the jury in steward v powler k b sittings after m t    0 had cost his client a pporter no less than eight pounds the trial of mr hastings let the eve be what it will is expected to cost him not less than one hundred thousand  a proceeding to which whethe it be good or bad the primitive constitution of the country is an utter and total stranger it gives occasion however to a number of offices a long list of fees and affords employment to a multitute of lawyers and attorneys a description of men unknown to the tourn or leet on may add also in former times to the country court an court baron and consequently to the ancient law which was too simple to need their interference and possibly too just to suffer it if the excellence of municipal law consist in the number and advantages of those who make it a profession then undoubtedly the mo voluminous obscure perplexed unintelligible and inconsistent it is the more in short matter is sacrificed to form and simplicity to complexedness the nearer it will approach to perfection a point to which english jurisprudence seems in a fair way to arrive happy the nation  claims the enlightened beccaria where the knowledge of the law is not science where the people not being ignorant of the consequences of their own actions do not become necessly dependent on a few who are the interpreters of the laws which instead of being public and general are thus rendered private and particular  the proceedings in the lee are without expense the suitor pays no fees and advocates or attorneys of course never enter it a publicspirited prosecutor cannot here be at a charge of forty or fifty pounds to get an offender in whose punishment he is no more concerned than any other member of society fined so many shillings or perhaps pence it is the practice of the court of kings bench and thence of the judges of oyer and terminer and jaldelivery and of the court of quarter sessions to assess an arbitrary fine upon persons convicted of certain offenses in those courts and compel the payment thereof upon pan of mprisonment for lie which in fact is frequently the consequence how far such a practice is reconcilable to the libety of the subject to the principles of the constitution to the law of the land and in particular to he   th chapter of magna charta is submitted to the honorable and worshipful magistrates concerned see also   black com     in the mean time it seems of very little importance when contending with the crown by whom a man is tried if the measure of his punishment is to e let to the discretion of the kings ministers this is obvious in lmost every thing that comes in a criminal way before a certain court of which the judges seem as glad to get a culpit into their clutches as the urrd law cats of rabelais person neschappe de ceas sans y laiss du til or ca ou de la peau le plus souvent or ca pantagruel l  c     nor will one of a different disposition find in this court an opportunity of gratifying his malice the punishment of the guilty is not aggravated nor the acquittal of the innocent purchased by the payment of heavy costs or court fees twentythree men do not here upon their oath find a man guilty of an offense of which twelve others likewise upon their oath immediately afterward acquit him nor do those who are sworn to enquire with diligence and present the truth refuse to hear half the evidence in fine public justice is not in this court sacrificed to private lucre nor a criminal process turned into an action for damages see   black com     nb all the references to this wor are to the  vo edition of       the reader must not from any thing here suggested collect an opini that a man should be hanged upon the secret enquiry and bae presentment of a grand jury the evidence ought in all cases to be publicly taken and as well for the accused as for the crown see   hale p c     st trials iv     add to this that to put a man to death by form  law for any cme or upon any pretense whatever is nothing more or  than a cool and deliberate murder which no necessity can require and which an irrational prejudice in favor of ancient barbarism a cal magistracy and an indolent unfeeling legislature will never justify th magistrate indeed hardened as he is may be in some measure excusable since he studies in a school where even murder will appear an act of gentleness and humanity when contrasted with the more than savage barbarit of a system he is taught to admire as the perfection of human jurisprudence in high treason this mildest and most boasted of crimi codes adjudges a virtuous perhaps and most amiable character  wh has offended no moral or social duty  who has been guilty only of adhering with a laudable fidelity to the cause of an unfortunate sovereign  of prefering at the worst the title of a tyrant without power to that  one in possession of it  or of speculating in his closet upon the title  tyrans in general one might add also of having the misfortune to profess an unpopular religion which a few years before had been the established one of the  hundrds on this account have ncurred the guilt of high treason and suffed  ordingly not for what they had done but for being what they w so their opinions and not their actions see the memoirs of missionary priests etc a curious work which every one who wishes to form a perfect idea of the charitable and tolerating disposition of the government law and church of england would do well to peruse he will there find that our pious protestant ancestors understood the use of torture as well as an inquisitor general or amboyna dutchman   to be drawn  originally naked with his feet tied to a horses tail  afterward on an oxes hide  and lastly it may be curio to remark the progress of judicial compassion on a hurdle or sledge cuthbert maine a priest was to be drawn a quarter of a mile to he place of execution and when he was to be laid on the sledge sm of he justices moved the sheiffs deputy that he would cause him to have his head laid over the cae that he might be dashed against the stones in drawing these good christians upright magistrates and loyal subjects doubtless thought this ingenious contrivance would be as acceptable to god as they knew it would be agreeable to the judges and the queen   to the place of execution there to be hanged by the neck but not till he is dead  no that would be cruel  he is to be cut down alive in caxtons chronicle c     is an instance of a pardon granted to five traitors after they were hanged and cut down  his privy members cut off and his heart and bowels ripped out and thrown into the fire before his face then his head is to be cut off and his body divided into four quarters which are to be at the kings disposal the execrable grant who first devised ordained or pemitted this horrid butchery oud probably eat them raw  and yet we talk of the hurons  but a grant is not to be satated even with blood nor appeased by the immolaation of agonizing victms he adds the basest rapine to the most atroious murder sizes the dowry of the disconsolate widow the patrimony of the helpless orphan and devotes to ages of misery the innocent and the nborn in petty treason  from a refined attention to the delicacy of the fair sx  a woman is only to be burnt alive  of late indeed the manity of the executioner  of the common hangman  has been proof against the baraous insensibility of the legislature and at the risque of is own life she is peviously strangled this punishment has been altered to hanging since these pages were prepared or the press see  0 g   c     and yet the authors of the bill of rights so undeservedly applauded thought it necessary to protest against new and unusual punishments as if the most diabolical imaginaion could suggest any equal to those already established at this time too there existed a species of torture equal if not superior n point of cruelty to any practiced in the inquisition  and in one respect t least much worse since it only terminated with the death of the mierable sufferer this was the peine fot et dure by which a prisoner who in order to secure his little property to his family refused to plead was gradually pressed to death in a dungeon by heavy weights upon h beast his only sustenance in the mean time  that is during two or three days  for so long have some unhappy wretches supported this excruciati rment  being the foul and loathsome water which the place afforded y way of prologue or preface to this torture the judges had a pleasant actice of tying the culprits hands together with whipcord  and while e wretch fainted with agony and the blood spouted from his fingers ould coolly order him away to consider how he should like something orse all this in the great mercy of the legislature has been lately anged to immediate death  punishment is only necessary or justifiable so far as it is beneficial to the community it induces the prevention of crimes and the reformation of the crim that of death in itself a crime however insicted answers neither ppose confounds all degrees of criminality and makes no difference between a man and a wolf is it not absurd  they are the words of  humane and philosophic beccaria  is it not absurd says he  the laws which detest and punish homicide should in order to preve murder publicly commit murder themselves what must men th when they see wise magistrates and grave ministers of justice with indference and tranquillity dragging a criminal to death and whilst a wre trembles with agony expecting the fatal stroke the judge who has condemned him with the coldest insensibility and perhaps with no sm gratification from the exertion of his authority quits his tribunal to enjoy the comforts and pleasures of life  the hungry judges soon the sentence sign and wretches hang that jurymen may dine it is not however to prevent murder alone that the law of england commits it since according to sir william blackstone its express panegyn among the variety of actions which men are daily liable to commit  less than an hundred and sixty have been declared by act of parliament to be felonies without benefit of clergy or in other words to be worthy of instant death so dreadful a list he adds instead of diminishing increases the number of offenders   com    this dreaful list since considerably augmented and every session continues to produce law breathing the spirit of draco and written in letters of blood  to return all that is here contended for is that the grand jury so called under proper regulations appears to be the most constitutional mode of tri and as favorable in every respect to the innocence of the accused as the petty jury than which in regard to the unanimity required from exactly twelve men upon oath nothing can be more absurd nor have a mo obvious tendency to perjury and injustice the only difficulty seems to be in the form or manner of the accusation which in fact is all that the finding of the grand jury now serves for a difficulty which were this  proper place for further discussion would not prove insurmountable     the peculiar excellence of this most ancient and respectable tribunal is that it does what is usually called every bodies business and nobodys business the juro are to enquire of such offenses or disorders as may happen within their own neighborhood under their own observation in order that if they cannot be avoided by timely interference an adequate penalty may prevent their reption they are to be themselves vigilant to see with eir own eyes to hear with their own ears and if the evidence of others should as it may sometimes in offenses lready committed happen to be necessary to receive it partially much of this can only be understood of those courts in which it is e custom to swear the jury in for the year where they are discharged e same day it should seem necessary for them to proceed chiefly upon vidence and indeed there is generally if not always a proclamation or that purpose  a jurisdiction of which the end is jusce will abhor the use of baseness in the means to attain  this of which we are now speaking affords neither ncouragement nor countenance to a common informer ho seems to be to law what the jackall is said to be to e lion  a servile and dependent monster employed to scover and hunt down the prey of an indolent and voraous tyrant  to conclude whether it be now too soon  for it eems impossible that the day should never arrive when he people at large will be convinced that even what is alled law may be unjust tyrannical and oppressive and that it is essential to their happiness to have justice admiistered in its utmost simplicity free of expense and as ear as possible to their own doors  but whether it be oo soon or too late to expect that the leet however enerable for its antiquity honorable for its constitutional rigin excellent in its institution and useful in its effects should ever recover its ancient influence and extende jurisdiction  unless by a remedy which might prove eve worse than the disease  the introduction of fees pleading lawyers and attorneys  it is at the same time much  be desired that the exercise of those powers which it  still retained and which apply to the punishment and prevention of such offenses as being the most frequent a possibly the most generally injurious or at least vexatious may be enforced with vigor and efficacy and society thereby receive a benefit which is only undervalue perhaps because it is not paid for and its source too litt beholden to distance and mystery  qualitys it would seen equally necessary to ensure reverence to religion and  law  the

obstinately refusing so to do for which they were amerced  0 l each   this amerciament was affeered but without necessity as the constables by neglect and refusal had ipso facto incurred the pain set

the same manor and liberty peruke maker two of the resiants and inhabitants within this manor and liberty being duly sumoned thereto upon pain according to ancient custom to serve our sovereign lord the king upon the enquest and other offices for this manor and liberty and the said benjamin walwyn and michael conner being at this court severally nominated and elected as proper persons to serve the office of constable within this manor and liberty for the year next ensuing or until they should be thereof discharged by due course of law and being severally called upon to accept the same office and to take the oath by law in that behalf required they and each of them did then and there refuse to accept the said office of constable and to take the oath in that behalf required and they nor either of them not having shown to the court any reasonable or just cause to excuse them or either of them from the said office the said deputy steward did thereupon think fit to impose and set upon the said bejamin walwyn for his said contempt and refusal a fine of seven pounds and upon the said michael conner for his said contempt and refusal the like fine of seven pounds  quitting the liberty m c      at this court it was found by the jury that joseph wright sworn constable for the royal ward is removed out of the said manor and liberty whereupon thomas ricketts being presented by the said jury as a proper person to serve the said office for the remainder of the year was elected by the steward and sworn in accordingly  m c      two similar entries  substitute the practice of swearing in substitute constables is of late years become so common as even to be regarded as a matter of course the difference between an assistant a deputy and a substitute seems to be that in the two former cases the principal is responsible in the latter case he is discharged but quaere  see assistant  usurping the office e c      robert evans for taking upon him the office of a constable and exerciseing the same without the leave of this court amerced  0 s reduced to  0 s  see disorderly houses  contempts departing without leave e c      john ashley for apearing at this court and in contempt thereof departing without license fined the difference between a fine and amerciament is that the former is the sole act of the court the latter must be grounded upon the presentiments of the jury and must likewise be affeered i e ascertained or reduced to certainty by indifferent persons sworn for that purpose and who are generally but not necessarily taken out of the jury see e c      and      instances of the affeerers not being jurymen it seems requisite however that they should be acquainted with the nature of the offense in respect whereof the amerciament is imposed a fine on the contrary needs no affeerment being imposed by the steward as judge for offenses committed within his own view or the defaults of the officers of the court a fine on an officer is likewise called an amerciament or amerciament royal but does not on that account require any affeering unless therefore john ashley was in office this fine was illegal  till the year      m c the amerciaments were always set by the jury in their presentiments at an express sum which was afterward affeered but this practice being thought irregular was then altered upon due deliberation and good advice so that then and thenceforward the amerciament was and has been set by the court indefinitely and therefore he is amerced answering to the ideo ipse in misericordia of the old precedents and afterward affeered at a precise sum it should be noticed however that some instances have been since discovered where an amerciament is set upon the presentiments of the aleconners etc in the very language now adopted and therefore he is amerced which may induce one to believe that it is but a restoration of the ancient practice see e c    0 m c    0 and e c         0 s  misbehaviour e c      john willson

it does not seem to be in power of the affeerers either to mitigate or to increase it from the preceding entry in      it may be conjectured that the pain was formerly specified in the summons in this

and short of the standing yard measure of london oneeight of an inch and the half bushel generally made use of in this manor and liberty is also considerably wanting in length and depth of the standard half bushel measure of london but it appearing that such yard and half bushel measures respectively have been stamped as true measures and that the persons using them may have been themselves deceived and may have used the same without any willful design to do wrong we the said jury do not think fit at this time to present or amerce any individual for the same but we the said jury and aleconners humbly pray that the steward high bailiff and burgesses of this court and liberty to order public notice to be given that every person within this manor and liberty do forthwith procure all their respective measures by them used or to be used within the same to be made agreeable to the standard measures of the city of london and we do also recommend it to the jury our successors to inquire after present and amerce at the next court all such persons as shall hereafter use any measures wanting or short of the standard measures of london and in as much as we the said jury having been informed that the aforesaid bad measures now used in this liberty were so stamped as true measures by the proper officer of the liberty of westminster who is entrusted to stamp measures and that his fees were paid for the same do recommend to the consideration of the court and also of the new jury our successors whether such stamping officer of westminster aforesaid should not have intimation given him of the matters now presented by us and be remonstrated with upon this occasion by the proper officer of the liberty of westminster entrusted to stamp measures it is supposed they mean the clerk of the market for that liberty who is by no means the proper officer for any place out of his own jurisdiction the standard yard and bushel are said to be kept in the exchequer and some officer of the court no doubt ought to seal the measures in default of the clerk of the market for the liberty of the savoy who at present is mr james armstrong  an entire new set of weights and measures was

defaulters this year for the reasons following  what the simple defaulters was amerced before the year      is uncertain but it does appear plainly by the entries made in the leet jurys book that for    years viz from      to lady day      the simple defaulters were amerced by the jury at   d each and no more at which lady day joseph whiston being foreman they were amerced    d but at the

been kept up at   d from that time to this michaelmas     when the present jury being desirous to reduce this amerciament to the ancient and usual sum of   d the court seemed uneasy and very unwilling to consent thereto and the bailiff did not then or at any time since exhibit or produce to the said jury any list or roll containing the number or the names of such defaulters nor make any returns to the jury which he as well as the constable aleconner etc ought to do yet notwithstanding a list is since entered in the stewards book as we are informed of     simple defaulters at the michaelmas leet

informed that the bailiff of the said liberty or his deputy had summoned the resiants to appear upon   l a piece and several of the said resiants not named in the list given him by the foreman of the jury it was ordered by the court that mr james fuller in the absence of the foreman of the jury do deliver a list to the steward of persons inhabitants to be summoned upon pain of five pounds a piece according to the antiant custom they not being summoned according to foremans list and the order of the last court and that thomas collingwood do summons such persons in such list named to appear on the   th instant as usual according to a list to be given him for that purpose and then the court adjourned to the   th of may instant  n b these orders are chiefly inserted to show the antiquity of the foremans list in other respects they are of no authority whatever if the bailiff had not done his duty the court ought to have set a fine upon him but had no power to transfer his office to another person thmas collingwood was the headheadle  a circumstance of which the steward could hardly be ignorant which renders it probable he was not present nor had any concern in this very irregular proceeding  iv representation of the jury e c      that no inhabitant ought to be put into an office in less than three years  we the jury for the liberty of the duchy finding by the jury book that it has heretofore been a method with several preceding jurys not to put any inhabitant into any of the ward offices in less then three years clear from their having served any one ward office as also not to putt any inhabitant on any office till he has been an inhabitant for full three years in the liberty but notwithstanding that this has been observed by several jurys yet for want of its being inserted in the jurys book the said rule has very offten been broke into to the detriment and very great hardship of several of the inhabitants aforesaid several of which have very often been put into two offices within the space of   or   years at most while great numbers of the other inhabitants of the said liberty have escaped from serving any one office at all for  0    or  0 years to remedy this hardship therefore we do here leave it as our oppinion and judgment and as a very great piece of justice do recommend it to all suceeding jurys that it the time of their chooseing the officers and jury to succeed them that they would take the trouble carefully to over look this book and only to put in such as have enjoyed three clear years besides the year they were in any office the jury also recommend it farther to their successors to cause this said representation or some other such as in their judgment will answer the purpose designed in writeing at the end of their

represent the many and great inconveniences this liberty at this time lies under for the want of a watch house the constubles being now oblidged to keep there watch in the round house in strand lane a place no ways fit for that purpose it is in a dark durty hole and so remote from great part of the liberty  many and frequent disorders happen in the night and more especially in the grand street from temple bar to the savoy to the great disturbance of the inhabitance of the said wards and of his majestys subjects passing too and froe about there lawful occasions the watchhouse of this liberty was originally erected by the burgesses by virtue of a license from king james ii under the duchy seal in      but was taken down and another built in   00 and this again was taken down in    by direction of the commissioners for more commodious building the new church in the strand in      it appears the constables kept their watch in st clements church house to the great damage of the same  and in order to remedy this great complaint we have bin careful to find out a fit and proper place which we hope will meet with your approbation  the place is at the east end of the new church in the strand we have had the ground measured and find that there is full room without aney hinderance to aney of the neighburhood  and we humbly hope you will give orders for the building of a watch house in that place which will be of great service to the liberty a watchhouse was soon afterward erected by the burgesses at the west end of the new church which stood till the year    0 when being looked upon as an unsightly object by virtue of an order of the duchy court and with the consent of the burgesses it was taken down and by leave of the rector and churchwardens a new one erected between the piers of

annexed comprised in one skin of vellum entitled the second schedule is contained a true and exact map plan and description of the said lordship or manor of the savoy and of the liberty and franchise of the duchy of lancaster called the savoy liberty as the same did appear to the said jurors on a view thereof and as the same has been surveyed and admeasured duly proved on oath and given in evidence on this inquisition by john rockque a skilful surveyor and which was conformable to the said jurors knowledge and remembrance of the known meats and bounds thereof save and except toward the west end of the said manor and liberty from the middle of a street called cecil street to the middle of a lane way or passage called ivy lane which has of late years been disused and not claimed as part of the said liberty but why or for what reason the said jurors know not  a copy or duplicate of this plan is in the jury room in the court house     this liberty is divided into four wards viz royalward middleward savoyward and churchward  the royalward lyes on the east end of the liberty beginning at the southwest corner of temple bar and from thence goeth along by the wall of the middle temple on the south and from thence extending westward and thence again toward the south as the said wall goes along to the river passing by a boundary stone with the mark of an anchor thereon till it falls into the river of thames and from thence extending along by the said river westward by several wharfs on the bank of the said river till it comes to milford lane and thence northward up the middle of the said lane comprehending the buildings on the east side thereof till it shoots out into the strand and from thence stretching over toward the northwest till it comes to the southwest corner of saint clements church and from thence passing by the west door of the said church till it comes by the corner of a row of houses on the north side of the churchyard comprehending the said houses and going though a passage there to the middle of a street called the backside of st clements and from thence extending eastward through the middle of butcher row by the kennel there till it comes opposite to the ship tavern just beyond the east end of the butcher row and from thence crossing over the way as the kennel now goes to the southward opposite to cross keys court till it comes to the kennel next without the footway there and from thence going eastward to temple bar where it first began  the middleward begins at the kennel on the north side of the strand without the footway there opposite to milford lane and from thence extending down by the middle of the said lane to the river thames being bounded all the way on the east side by the royalward before described and extending from the bottom of milford lane all along by the river thames as the said river runs toward the northwest till it comes to strand bridge stairs including the same and from thence turning northward up strand bridge lane by the wall of somerset house garden and somerset house the boundary toward the west till it comes into that part of the highway called the strand where the kennel runs without the footway on the north side of the said highway and then turning eastward from that part of the said kennel which is opposite to the northeast corner of the front buildings in somerset house all long by the said kennel till it comes opposite to milford lane where the boundary first began  the savoyward begins at the northeast corner of the buildings in the front of somerset house in the strand and from thence extending by the wall or boundary of somerset house and garden to the river of thames being bounded all the way on the east side of the middleward before described until it comes to strand bridge and from thence extending all along by the river of thames as the said river runs to the northwest till it comes to a stone marked with an anchor in the wall next the river at the bottom of cecil street and from thence extending in the same manner till it comes to ivy bridge and from thence comprehending the said bridge turning northward all along by durham yard within the liberty of westminster the boundary toward the west end of the duchy liberty till it comes into the middle of the high street called the strand comprehending the buildings described in the map to be the ancient site of salisbury house and from the middle of the high street opposite to ivy bridge and the said jurors on their oaths aforesaid do further say and present that it appears to them by authentic copiers of two several surveys of the sand man or liberty duly proved and given in evidence on this quisition that is to say one a copy of a survey or return of a commission under seal of the said duchy of lancaster and remaining of record in the duchy office for bounding her then majestys manor of the savoy beating date the sixth day of february in the fortyfourth year of the reign of queen elizabeth and the other a copy of a survey taken by ordinance of parliament in the year      remaining of record in the augmentation office that the bounds of the said manor liberty or franchise at the respective times of taking the said several surveys did extend toward the west to the middle of ivy lane opposite to ivy bridge and therefore the said jurors no contrary evidence having been given to them on their oaths aforesaid do say and present that the boundary of the said manor and liberty ought not to terminate to the westward at the middle of cecil street but ought to extend opposite the middle of ivy lane aforesaid according to the surveys aforesaid and as in the map or plan herein before mentioned is expressed and declared  this inquisition is in many respects an admirable record and the plan very accurately and neatly delineated the jurors however were undoubtedly misled by the survey of    eliz for in fact there is no mention of ivy lane in that of      whether there were any blame in not enquiring more minutely into a matter so important as evey this is which men have to deliver upon oath as a guide to posterity and upon whom it ought to fall we cannot well say but the reason and cause of this serious mistake was in truth as follows soon after the   th eliz which was the year   0  being the last of her reign the ancient lane called ivy lane or ivy bridge lane was by virtue of a grant under the duchy seal and of a writ of ad quod dumnam and an inquisition thereon taken away or blocked up by sir robert cecil afterward earl of salisbury who in lieu thereof opened a new lane or passage from the strand to the river on the west side of his house which retained the old name of ivy lane as a bridge at the bottom of it did that of ivy bridge the ancient bridge was of a very different nature both ivy lane and strand lane were originally low subterraneous passages somewhat resembling it is thought the present arched cartways to the adelphi wharfs the bridges themselves being in the high street vide stows survey by strype  ic c   it is wonderful that the translation of ivy lane should have escaped the researches of this industrious edito se works was originally published in      this proceeding which was confirmed by a private act of parliament in the  d year of k james i could not however affect the boundary of the liberty and as the middle of cecil street has ever since it was made been looked upon and perambulated as the west boundary it seems highly probable that the middle of this street is the identical ground which at the time of taking the survey of the   th eliz was the middle of ivy lane instead therefore of the words in italies we ought to read the following  and from thence turning directly northward up the middle of cecil street the boundary toward the west end of the duchy liberty till it comes into the middle of the high street called the strand and from the middle of the high street opposite to the middle of cecil street   extending eastward till it comes opposite to the middle of burleigh street near exeter change and from thence extending up the middle of burleigh street till it comes to a corner extending toward the northeast to the corner of a building about eighty foot in length near which is placed in the front the mark of an anchor and from thence going on by the ancient site of burleigh house on the northeast side thereof till it comes to the north side of a house fiftyfive foot distant from the front thereof now in the strand in the possession of mrs nicholson pewterer and from thence proceeding on to the kennel on the north side of the strand next without the footway there eighteen foot or thereabouts distant from the front buildings there and from thence extending to the eastward along by the said kennel leaving the church of saint mary le strand on the south till it comes a little beyond the east end of the said church and from thence stretching over as the said kennel in part goes to the middle of the highway called the strand opposite to the northeast corner of the front buildings of somerset house on the northwest end of strand bridge lane where the boundary first began  the churchward begins a small distance from the end of holywell street and from thence extending southward to the highway called the strand till it comes to the boundary of the middle ward almost opposite to strand bridge lane being bounded toward the west by part of the end of the savoy ward before described and from thence extending eastward along the said highway called the strand being bounded toward the south by the middle ward before described till it comes almost opposite to the end of milford lane and from thence stretching northward and northeastward near the corner of saint clements church being bounded toward the east by the royal ward before described and going through the passage from saint clements churchyard near the said church till it falls into the kennel in the middle of the said street called the backside of saint clements and from thence extending toward the west all along by the kennel in the middle of holywell street comprehending the buildings on the south side of the said street till it falls into a cross kennel toward the west end of the said street where the boundary first began  finis
