the first epistle of the second book of horace imitated  ne rubeam pingui donatus munere hor london printed for t cooper at the globe in paternoster row mdccxxxvii  price one shilling  advertisement the reflections of horace and the judgments past in this epistle to augustus seemed so seasonable to the present times that i could not help applying them to the use of my own country the author thought them considerable enough to address them to his prince whom he paints with all the great and good qualities of a monarch upon whom the romans depended for the increase of an absolute empire but to make the poem entirely english i was willing to add one or two such as contribute to the happiness of a free people and are more consistent with the welfare of our neighbors  this epistle will show the learned world to have fallen into two mistakes one that augustus was a patron of poets in general whereas he not only prohibited all but the best writers to name him but recommended that care even to the civil magistrate admonebat praetores ne paterentur nomen suum obsolefieri etc the other to imagine this piece to be a general discourse of poetry whereas it is an apology for the poets in order to render augustus more their patron horace here pleads the cause of his cotemporaries first against the taste of the town whose humor it was to magnify the authors of the preceding age secondly against the court and nobility who encouraged only the writers for the theater and lastly against the emperor himself who had conceived them of little use to the government he shows by a view of the progress of learning and the change of taste among the romans that the introduction of the polite arts of greece had given the writers of his time great advantages over their predecessors that their morals were much improved and the license of those ancient poets restrained that satire and comedy were become more just and useful that whatever extravagancies were left on the stage were owing to the ill taste of the nobility that poets under due regulations were in many respects useful to the state and concludes that it was upon them the emperor himself must depend for his fame with posterity  we may farther learn from this epistle that horace made his court to this great prince by writing with a decent freedom toward him with a just contempt of his low flatterers and with a manly regard to his own character  the first epistle of the second book of horace cum tot sustineas etc while you great patron of mankind sustain the balanced world and open all the main your country chief in arms abroad defend at home with morals arts and laws amend how shall the muse from such a monarch steal an hour and not defraud the public weal romulus et liber pater etc edward and henry now the boast of fame and virtuous alfred a more sacred name after a life of generous toils endured the gaul subdued or property secured ambition humbled mighty cities stormed or laws established and the world reformed closed their long glories with a sigh to find the unwilling gratitude of base mankind all human virtue to its latest breath finds envy never conquered but by death the great alcides every labor past had still this monster to subdue at last sure fate of all beneath whose rising ray each star of meaner merit fades away oppressed we feel the beam directly beat those suns of glory please not till they set praesenti tibi etc to thee the world its present homage pays the harvest early but mature the praise great friend of liberty in kings a name above all greek above all roman fame whose word is truth as sacred and revered as heavens own oracles from altars heard wonder of kings like whom to mortal eyes none ever has risen and none ever shall rise sed tuus hoc populus etc just in one instance be it yet confessed your people sir are partial in the rest foes to all living worth except your own and advocates for folly dead and gone authors like coins grow dear as they grow old it is the rust we value not the gold chaucers worst ribaldry is learned by rote and beastly skeleton poet laureat to hen   a volume of whose verses has been lately reprinted consisting almost wholly

scotland christs kirk of the green and each true briton is to ben so civil he swears the muses met him at the the devil tavern where ben johnson held his poetical club devil si quia graecorum sunt etc though justly greece her eldest sons admires why should not we be wiser than our sires in every public virtue we excel we build we paint we sing we dance as well and learned athens to our art must stoop could she behold us tumbling through a hoop si meliora dies ut vina etc if time improve our wit as well as wine say at what age a poet grows divine shall we or shall we not account him so who died perhaps an hundred years ago end all dispute and fix the year precise when british bards begin timmortalize  who lasts a century can have no flaw  i hold that wit a classick good in law quid qui deperiit minor etc suppose he wants a year will you compound and shall we deem him ancient right and sound or damn to all eternity at once at ninety nine a modern and a dunce  we shall not quarrel for a year or two  by courtesy of england he may do utor permisso caudaeque etc then by the rule that made the horsetail bare i pluck out year by year as hair by hair and melt down ancients like a heap of snow while you to measure merits look in stowe and estimating authors by the year bestow a garland only on a bier ennius  and sapiens and fortis etc shakespeare shakespeare and ben johnson may truly be said not much to have thought of immortal fame the one in many pieces composed in haste for the stage the other in his latter works in general which dryden calls his dotages  whom you and every playhouse bill style the divine the matchless what you will for gain not glory winged his roving flight and grew immortal in his own despite ben old and poor as little seemed to heed the life to come in every poets creed who now reads cowley if he pleases yet his moral pleases not his pointed wit forgot his epic nay  pindaric art which has much more merit than his epic but very unlike the character as well as numbers of pindar pindaric art but still i love the language of his heart  adeo sanctum est etc yet surely surely these were famous men  what boy but hears the sayings of old ben  in all debates where critics bear a part  not one but nods and talks of johnsons art  of shakespeares nature and of cowleys wit  how beaumonts judgment checked what fletcher writ  how shadwell shadwell hasty wycherly was slow nothing was less true than this particular but this paragraph has a mixture of irony and must not altogether be taken for horaces own judgment only the common chatt of the pretenders to criticism in some things right in others wrong as he tells us in his answer interdum vulgus rectum videt est ubi peccat  hasty wycherly was slow  but for the passions southern sure and row  these only these support the crowded stage  from eldest heywood down to cibbers age interdum vulgus etc all this may be the peoples voice is odd it is and it is not the voice of god to gammer gurton a piece of very low humor one of the first printed plays in english and therefore much valued by some antiquaries gammer gurton if it give the bays and yet deny the careless husband praise or say our fathers never broke a rule why then i say the public is a fool but let them own that greater faults than we they had and greater virtues i will agree spenser himself affects the spenser too much affects the obsolete particularly in the shepherds calendar where he imitates the unequal measures as well as the language of chaucer obsolete and sydneys verse halts ill on roman feet miltons strong pinion now not heaven can bound now serpentlike in prose he sweeps the ground in quibbles angel and archangel join and god the father turns a schooldivine not that i would lop the beauties from his book like slashing bentley with his desperate hook or damn all shakespeare like the affected fool at court who hates whatever he read at school  sed emendata videri etc but for the wits of either charless days the mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease sprat carew sedsey and a hundred more like twinkling stars the miscellanies over one simile that solitary shines in the dry desert of a thousand lines or lengthened thought that gleams through many a page has sanctified whole poems for an age indignor quidquam reprehendi etc i lose my patience and i own it too when works are censured not as bad but new while if our elders break all reasons laws these fools demand not pardon but applause recti necne crocum etc on avons bank where flowers eternal blow if i but ask if any weed can grow one tragic sentence if i dare deride which bettertons grave action dignified or wellmouthd booth with emphasis proclaims though but perhaps a musterroll of names an absurd custom of several actors to pronounce with emphasis the mere proper names of greeks or romans which as they call it fill the mouth of the player a musterroll of names how will our fathers rise up in a rage and swear all shame is lost in georges age you would think no fools disgraced the former reign did not some grave examples yet remain who scorn a lad should teach his father skill and having once been wrong will be so still jam saliare numae carmen etc he who to seem more deep than you or i extols old bards or merlins prophecy mistake him not he envies not admires and to debase the sons exalts the sires had ancient times conspired to disallow what then was new what had been ancient now or what remained so worthy to be read by learned critics of the mighty dead ut primum positis nugari etc in days of ease when now the weary sword was sheathed and luxury with charles restored in every taste of foreign courts improved a verse of the lord lansdown  all by the kings example lived and loved then peers grew proud in  in horsemanship texcell and every flowery courtier writ romance the duke of newcastles book of horsemanship the romance of parthenissa by the earl of orrery and all the french romances translated by persons of quality horsemanship to excel newmarkets glory rose as britains fell the soldier breathed the gallantries of france and every flowery courtier writ romance then marble softened into life grew warm and yielding metal flowed to human form lely on animated canvas stole the sleepy eye that spoke the melting soul no wonder then when all was love and sport the willing muses were debauched at court on each enervate string etc the siege of rhodes by sir william davenant the first opera sung in england on each enervate string they taught the note to pant or tremble through an eunuchs throat sub nutrice puella velut etc but britain changeful as a child at play now calls in princes and now turns away now whig now tory what we loved we hate now all for pleasure now for church and state now for prerogative and now for laws effects unhappy from a noble cause romae dulce diu fuit etc time was a sober englishman would knock his servants up and rise by five a clock instruct his family in every rule and send his wife to church his son to school to worship like his fathers was his care to teach their frugal virtues to his heir to prove that luxury could never hold and place on good security his gold mutavit mentem populus levis etc now times are changed and one poetic itch has seized the court and city poor and rich sons sires and grandsires all will wear the bays our wives read milton and our daughters plays to theaters and to rehearsals throng and all our grace at table is a song i who so often renounce the muses lie not s self ever tells more fibs than i when sick of muse our follies we deplore and promise our best friends to ryme no more we wake next morning in a raging fit and call for pen and ink to show our wit navem agere ignarus navis timet etc he served a prenticeship who sets up shop ward a famous empirick whose pill and drop had several surprising effects and were one of the principal subjects of writing and conversation at this time ward tried on puppies and the poor his drop even radcliffs doctors travel first to france nor dare to practice till they have learned to dance who builds a bridge that never drove a pyle should ripley venture all the world would smile but those who cannot write and those who can all ryme and scrawl and scribble to a man hic error tamen et levis etc yet sir reflect the mischief is not great these madmen never hurt the church or state sometimes the folly benefits mankind and rarely avarice taints the tuneful mind allow him but his plaything of a pen he never rebels or plots like other men flight of cashiers or fires he will never mind and knows no losses while the muse is kind to cheat a friend or ward he leaves to peter the good man heaps up nothing but mere meter enjoys his garden and his book in quiet and then  a perfect hermit in his diet militiae quanquam piger and malus etc of little use the man you may suppose who says in verse what others say in prose yet let me show a poets of some weight and  and though no soldier horace had not acquitted himself much to his credit in this capacity  non been relicta parmula in the battle of philippi it is manifest he alludes to himself in this whole account of a poets character but with an intermixrure of irony vivit siliquis and pane secundo has a relation to his epicurism os tenerum pueri is ridicule the nobler office of a poet follows torquet ab obscoenis  mox etiam pectus  recte fact a refert etc which the imitator has applied where he thinks it more due than to himself he hopes to be pardoned if as he is sincerely inclined to praise what deserves to be praised he arraigns what deserves to be arraigned in the   0     and    th verses though no soldier useful to the state what will a child learn sooner than a song what better teach a foreigner the tongue what is long or short each accent where to place and speak in public with some sort of grace i scarce can think him such a worthless thing unless he praise some monster of a king or virtue or religion turn to sport to please a lewd or unbelieving court unhappy dryden  in all charless days roscommon only boasts unspotted bays and in our own excuse some courtly strains no whiter page than addison remains torquet ab obscoenis etc he from the taste obscene reclaims our youth and sets the passions on the side of truth forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art and pours each human virtue in the heart let ireland tell how wit upheld her cause her trade supported and supplied her laws and leave on swift this grateful verse ingravd the rights a court attacked a poet saved behold the hand that wrought a nations cure stretched to relieve the idiot and the poor a foundation for the maintenance of idiots and a fund for assisting the poor by lending small sums of money on demand  proud vice to brand or injured worth adorn and stretch the ray to ages yet unborn not but there are who merit other palms hopkins and sternhold glad the heart with psalms disceret unde preces etc the boys and girls whom charity maintains implore your help in these pathetic strains how could devotion touch the country pews unless the gods bestowed a proper muse verse chears their leisure verse assists their work verse prays for peace or sings down pope and turk the silenced preacher yields to potent strain and feels that grace his prayer besought in vain the blessing thrills through all the laboring throng and heaven is won by violence of song agricolae prisci fortes etc our rural ancestors with little blessed patient of labor when the end was rest indulged the day that housed their annual grain with feasts and offerings and a thankful strain the joy their wives their sons and servants share ease of their toil and partners of their care the laugh the jest attendants on the bowl smoothed every brow and opened every soul fescennina per hunc inventa etc with growing years the pleasing license grew and taunts alternate innocently flew but times corrupt and nature illinclind produced the point that left a sting behind till friend with friend and families at strife triumphant malice raged through private life who felt the wrong or feared it took the alarm appealed to law and justice lent her arm at length by wholesome dread of statutes bound the poets learned to please and not to wound most warped to flattrys side but some more nice preserved the freedom and forbore the vice hence satire rose that just the medium hit and heals with morals what it hurts with wit graecia capta serum victorem etc we conquered france but felt our captives charms her arts victorious triumphed over our arms britain to soft refinements less a foe wit grew polite and numbers learned to flow mr waller about this time with the e of dorset mr godolphin and others translated the pompey of corneille and the more correct french poets began to be in reputation waller was smooth but dryden taught to join the varying verse the full resounding line the long majestic march and energy divine though still some traces of our rustic vein and splayfoot verse remained and will remain late very late correctness grew our care when the tired nation breathed from civil war quid sophocles and thespis etc exact racine and corneilles noble fire showed us that france had something to admire not but the tragic spirit was our own and full in shakespeare fair in otway shone but otway failed to polish or refine and fluent shakespeare scarce effaced a line even copious dryden wanted or forgot the last and greatest art the art to blot creditur ex medio etc some doubt if equal pains or equal fire the humbler muse of comedy require but in known images of life i guess the labor greater as the indulgence less observe how seldom even the best succeed tell me if congreves fools are fools indeed what pert low dialogue has farquar writ how van wants grace who never wanted wit the stage how loosely does afra belin authoress of several obscene plays etc astraea tread who fairly puts all characters to bed and idle cibber how he breaks the laws to make poor pinky eat with vast applause but fill their purse our poets work is done alike to them by pathos or by pun quem tulit ad scenam etc o you whom vanitys light bark conveys on fames mad voyage by the wind of praise with what a shifting gale your course you ply for ever sunk too low or born too high who pants for glory finds but short repose a breath revives him or a breath oerthrows farewell the stage if just as thrives the play the silly bard grows fat or falls away saepe etiam audacem fugat etc there still remains to mortify a wit the manyheaded monster of the pit a senseless worthless and unhonourd crowd who to disturb their betters mighty proud clattring their sticks before ten lines are spoke call for the farce the bear or the blackjoke for farce the people true delight affords farce long the taste of mobs but now of lords taste that eternal wanderer which flies from heads to ears and now from ears to eyes the play stands still damn action and discourse back fly the scenes and enter foot and horse pageants on pageants in long order drawn peers heralds bishops ermin gold and lawn the champion too and to complete the jest the coronation of henry the eighth and queen anne boleyn in which the playhouses tried with each other to represent all the pomp of a coronation in this noble contention the armor of one of the kings of england was borrowed from the tower to dress the champion old edwards armor beams on cibbers breast si foret in terris etc with laughter sure democritus had died had he beheld an audience gape so wide let bear or elephant be ever so white the people sure the people are the sight ah luckless poet stretch thy lungs and roar that bear or elephant shall heed thee more while all its throats the gallery extends and all the thunder of the pit ascends loud as the wolves on orcas stormy steep the furthest northern promontory of scotland opposite to the orcades orcas stormy steep howl to the roarings of the northern deep such is the shout the longapplauding note at quins high plume or oldfields petticoat or when from court a birthday suit bestowed sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load booth enters  hark the universal peal  but has he spoken not a syllable  what shook the stage and made the people stare catos long wig flowrd gown and lacquerd chair ac ne forte putes me etc yet lest you think i railly more than teach or praise malignly arts i cannot reach let me for once presume tinstruct the times to know the poet from the man of rymes it is he who gives my breast a thousand pains can make me feel each passion that he feigns inrage compose with more than magic art with pity and with terror tear my heart and snatch me over the earth or through the air to thebes to athens when he will and where verum age and his etc but not this part of the poetic state alone deserves the favor of the great think of those authors sir who would rely more on a readers sense than gazers eye or who shall wander where the muses sing who climb their mountain or who taste their spring how shall we fill munus apolline dignum the palatine library then building by augustus a library with wit when merlins cave a building in the royal gardens of richmond where is a small but choice collection of books merlins cave is half unfurnished yet multa quidem nobis etc my liege why writers little claim your thought i guess and with their leave will tell the fault we poets are upon a poets word of all mankind the creatures most absurd the season when to come and when to go to sing or cease to sing we never know and if we will recite nine hours in ten you lose your patience just like other men then too we hurt our selves when to defend a single verse we quarrel with a friend repeat unasked lament the wits too fine for vulgar eyes and point out every line but most when straining with too weak a wing we needs will write epistles to the king and from the moment we oblige the town expect a place or pension from the crown or dubbed historians by express command to enroll your triumphs over the seas and land be called to court to plan some work divine as once for louis boileau and racine sed tamen est operae pretium etc yet think great sir so many virtues shown ah think what poet best may make them known or choose at least some minister of grace fit to bestow the laureats weighty place gratus alexandro regi magno etc charles to late times to be transmitted fair assigned his figure to berninis care and great nassau to knellers hand decreed to fix him graceful on the bounding steed so well in paint and stone they judged of merit but kings in wit may want discerning spirit the hero william and the martyr charles one knighted blackmore and one pensiond quarles which made old ben and surly dennis swear  no lords anointed but a russian bear nec magis expressi vultus etc not with such majesty such bold relief the forms august of king or conquering chief ever swelled on marble as in verse have shined in polished verse the manners and the mind oh could i mount on the maeonian wing your arms your actions your repose to sing what seas you traversed and what fields you fought your countrys peace how often how dearly bought how barbarous rage subsided at your word and nations wondered while they dropped the sword how when you nodded over the land and deep peace stole her wing and wrapped the world in sleep till earths extremes your mediation own and asias tyrants tremble at your throne  but verse alas your majesty disdains and i am not used to panegyric strains the zeal of fools offends at any time but most of all the zeal of fools in ryme besides a fate attends on all i write that when i aim at praise they say i bite nil moror officium quod me gravat etc a vile encomium doubly ridicules there is nothing blackens like the ink of fools if true a woeful likeness and if lies  praise undeserved is scandal in disguise well may he blush who gives it or receives and when i flatter let my dirty leaves like journals odes and such forgotten things as eusden philips settle writ of kings cloth spice line trunks or fluttering in a row befringe the rails of bedlam and sohoe finis
