the grounds of criticism in poetry contained in some new discoveries never made before requisite for the writing and judging of poems surely  being a preliminary to a larger work designed to be published in folio and entitled a criticism upon our most celebrated english poets deceased  by mr dennis  london printed for geo strahan at the goldenball against the exchange in cornhill and bernard lintott at the middle temple gate fleet street   0   the preface the following treatise is but a small part of a volume of criticism intended to be published in folio in which in treating of the works of the most celebrated english poets deceased i designed to show both by reason and examples that the use of religion in poetry was absolutely necessary to raise it to the greatest exaltation of which so noble an art is capable and on the other side that poetry was requisite to religion in order to its making more forcible impressions upon the minds of men  and this i thought would be an effectual way of reconciling people to a regulated stage in spite of the grimaces of some spiritual comedians who have themselves a mind to be the only actors in vogue and who in order to a total suppression of the stage have endeavored to set up private authorities against the common sense of mankind and the errors of two or three churchmen against divine inspiration for i appeal to any impartial reader whether the constant practice in all ages of the best and the bravest nations in their most flourishing states may not pass for the common sense of men and we know very well that st paul whom we believe to be divinely inspired has made use of heathen poets nay even heathen dramatick poets for the reformation of mankind witness that famous passage evil communications corrupt good manners which st paul makes use of in his second epistle to the corinthians and which grotius informs us that he borrowed from the thais of the famous menander now how that which was the language of the holy ghost in the mouth of st paul comes to be the language of the devil in ours i believe our bigots will find it a difficult matter to show  it it plain then that these persons by designing totally to suppress the stage which is the only encouragement that we have in these islands of poetry manifestly intended to drive out so noble and useful an art from among us and by that means endeavored with all their might to weaken the power of religion which has need of poetry to make its utmost impression upon the minds of men  in short almost all but the ceremonial and historical part of the old testament was delivered in poetry and that is almost half of it and a considerable part of the doctrine of the gospel was delivered in parables which as my lord bacon has justly observed in his advancement of learning lib   chap i are a kind of divine poesy i might here very truly observe that not only job and solomons song and part of the prophets but several too of our saviors parables are though not dramatick poems yet poesy that is dramatical that is poesy in which persons are introduced who are talking in dialogue  from what has been said this consequence must undeniably follow that either they who delivered our religion were mistaken in the manner of doing it which will by no means consist with our belief of the divinity of one of them or the divine inspiration of the rest or that our religion must be most powerfully propagated by the same means by which it was at first delivered  i believe that it would be an easy matter to prove that it was the use of exalted poesy such as the lofty hymn of st ambrose that blew up the flame of christian zeal to such a transporting height in the primitive and apostolical times and that the neglect of so divine an art has not only in these latter days considerably lessened the force of religion but has with some people among us gone a very great way toward the making the public worship contemptible but i leave it to our prelates and pastors to consider whether since they are satisfied that there is a necessity for an harmonious and a numerous style in some parts of our public worship they ought so long to have remained contented with the vile meetre of hopkins and by that proceeding to suffer the most lofty and most pathetick divine poetry to be burlesqud and ridiculed in our churches which is all one as if each sunday they should dress up a bishop in some antic habit and expose him in that merry garb in order to raise the veneration of the people  that poetry is necessary for the enforcing religion upon the minds of men may i think appear very plainly from what has been said and from what will be said upon that subject in the following treatise but since our clergy by their constant practice appear to be already satisfied of it i leave it to them to consider whether they ought not rather to make it part of their business to set poetry and consequently the stage upon a good foot than to endeavor with all their might to drive out both from among us  since i mentioned my lord bacon above i desire the readers leave to lay before him a most beautiful passage of that great genius concerning the worth and the use of poetry which he esteems to be the second principal bruanch of learning  as for narrative poesy says he in the    chapter of the   lib of his advancement of learning or if you please heroical so you understand it of the matter not of the verse it seems to be raised altogether from a noble foundation which makes much for the dignity of mans nature for seeing the sensible world is in dignity inferior to the soul of man poesy seems to endow human nature with that which history denies and to give satisfaction to the mind with at least the shadow of things where the substance cannot be had for if the matter be thoroughly considered a strong argument may be drawn from poetry that a more stately greatness of things a more perfect order and a more beautiful variety delights the soul of man than can be any way found in nature since the fall wherefore seeing the acts and events which are the subject of true history are not of that amplitude as to content the mind of man poesy is ready at hand to fain acts more heroical because true history reports the successes of business not proportionable to the merit of virtues and vices poesy corrects it and presents events and fortunes according to desert and according to the law of providence because true history through the frequent satiety and similitude of things works a distaste and misprision in the mind of men poetry cheereth and refreshes the soul chanting things rare and various and full of vicissitudes so as poetry serves and conferreth to delectation magnanimity and morality and therefore it may seem deservedly to have some participation of divineness because it does raise the mind and exalt the spirit with high raptures by proportioning the shows of things to the desires pf the mind and not submitting the mind to things as reason and history do and by these allurements and congruities whereby it cherishes the soul of men joined also with consort of music whereby it may more sweetly insinuate it self it has won such access that it has been in estimation even in rude times and barbarous nations when other learning stood excluded  but because that poetry which we call heroic has been but barely neglected among us and the great cry has been against the dramatick let us see what the same extraordinary person says in defense of that  dramatick or representative poesy says he which brings the world upon the stage is of excellent use if it were not abused for the instructions and corruptions of the stage may be great but the corruptions in this kind abound the discipline is altogether neglected in our times for although in modern commonwealths stage plays be but esteemed a sport or pastime unless they draw from the satyr and be mordant yet the care of the ancients was that the stage should instruct the minds of men unto virtue nay wise men and great philosophers have accounted it as the archet or musical bow of the mind and certainly it is most true and as it were a secret of nature that the minds of men are more patent to affections and impressions congregate than solitary  in this last observation which is perfectly beautiful my lord bacon has given a very solid reason why the drama must be more useful than history and more prevalent than philosophy and a little lower he has given two more though he has applied them to a sort of poetry which is somewhat different and those are that dramatick fables are more sensible than arguments and more fit than examples  at the same time that extraordinary man declares like a most just and discerning judge that the modern stage was but a shadow of the ancient and an imperfect shadow that it had something of its show but nothing of its reality that is that it was not only a vain and an empty but a dangerous amusement and he plainly taxes the modern policy with the neglect of its discipline indeed in this as well as other things there is as great a difference between ancient and modern policy as there is between ancient and modern extent of empire  but the wisdom of the queen can never be too much extolled who has vouchsafed to take care of that which all her predecessors neglected  that discerning princess is resolved to support the stage that it may be instrumental to the reforming her people and she is resolved to regulate it that it may no longer be justly accused of corrupting their manners  the following treatise as has been said above is but a small portion of a much larger which was designed for the improvement of modern poetry and of the drama particularly and here i desire the readers leave to do two things first to lay down the design and method of the larger treatise and then to give an account to the world why no more is published  the design then and the method of the whole treatise as they were delivered in the second proposal are as follows  the proposal first the design is to restore poetry to all its greatness and to all its innocence  that poetry is miserably fallen is i suppose granted and as there never was more occasion for a just and impartial criticism on account of the generality of the writers so there never was more necessity for one on account of the readers and the spectators for the taste of both the readers and the spectators was never so debauched as if is at present of which we have given the reasons in another place some of them would be thought to approve of every thing that they either read or see and value themselves upon that that is upon their want of discernment to distinguish right from wrong others are so squeamish that they like nothing and value themselves even upon that too that is upon the sickliness and the unsoundness of their minds because he who likes nothing tastes nothing and want of taste is want of sense but this is not all even they who pretend to like nothing will at the play houses be pleased with every thing and they who would be thought to approve of every thing like nothing long for nothing but truth can be long esteemed and truth it self to be long esteemed must be distinguished from falsehood from these random ways of judging it comes to pass that this town in the compass of ten years happens to have one and the same author in the greatest admiration and in the utmost contempt which is infinitely a greater satyr upon the town than it can be on the author for the town is certainly in the wrong in one of the extremes at least and perhaps in both whereas the authors for the most part give no occasion for either of them this random or this partial way of judging has been the cause that poetry is banished from the rest of europe and is upon its last legs in england  the design of the foresaid treatise is not only to retrieve so noble an art and to fix the rules both of writing and of judging that both readers and writers may be at some certainty but to raise it to a height which it has never known before among us and to restore it as we said above to all its greatness and to all its innocence  but whereas several may imagine that the design is chimerical of restoring poetry either to its greatness or to its innocence we think it proper to satisfy the reader in as few words as we can that both may be easily effected    poetry may easily be restored to its former greatness because the discovering the cause of a disease is more than half the cure of it but the true and almost only cause of the declention of poetry that cause which has lain hid for so many ages has been already discovered in a little tract that was published two years ago advancement and reformation of modern poetry  for which i have the opinion of several of the best judges in england and that matter will be set in so clear a light in the beginning of the foresaid treatise without repeating any thing that was said before or at least as little as may be as may satisfy the most incredulous but    poetry may easily be restored to its innocence by taking a proper method a method that may be more prevalent with the writers than either law or philosophy which have been used in vain for let us but consider the character that horace has given of a poet vatis avarus non temere est animus versus amet hoc studet unum detrimenta fugas servorum incendia ridet   in short a poet will contemn every thing but the acquiring the reputation of a good poet this is what he makes his only business and the sole design of his life and there is no reprimand that you can give him and no remonstrance that you can make him that he will not laugh at until you convince him that he is an ill poet and indeed he is partly in the right for an ill poet is ten times more ridiculous than a blockhead of any other profession for an ill physician or an ill lawyer know their own ignorance and make it their business to be esteemed by the people but on the contrary an ill poet is found out by every body and admires himself than which nothing can be more a jest so that there is nothing he will refuse to do to avoid the infamy of that reputation from whence it follows that in the foresaid criticism there is a motive that will work more strongiy upon them than the censures of our reformers for there we clearly show them that poetry by losing its innocence loses its very nature for if poetry be more philosophical and more instructive than history as aristotle is pleased to affirm of it and no man ever knew the nature either of poetry or of history or of philosophy better than he did why then that art or rather that artifice with which a great many writers of verses and plays debauch and corrupt the people is a thing to which poetry is as directly contrary as a virgin is to a whore and these people are no more poets than those empricks are physicians who make their jackpuddings swallow potions to recommend them to the people  in the foresaid treatise we clearly show them that piety and virtue was not only the first original but that it has been is and will be the only solid basis nay and the very life and soul of the greater poetry that the farther poetry declines from that the farther it recedes from its very nature and essence and that the true poetry is as inconsistent and as incompatible with vice as the harmony and light and raptures of heaven with the gloomy horrors of hell and the proving this in so clear a manner as we pretend to do will oblige those poets who are never so profligate in their inclinations to be virtuous at least in their writings  both they and their readers will then be satisfied that the true poetical genius is a great and a sacred thing and to quote an admirable passage from milton is wherever it is found the inspired gift of god rarely bestowed but yet to some says he in every nation though most abuse it and is of power beside the office of a pulpit to imbreed and cherish in a great people the seeds of virtue and public civility to allay the perturbations of the mind and set the affections in a right tune to celebrate in glorious and lofty hymns the throne and equipage of gods almightiness and what he works and what he suffers to be wrought with high providence in his church to sing victorious agonies of martyrs and saints the deeds and triumphs of just and pious nations doing valiantly through faith against the enemies of christ to deplore the general relapses of kingdoms and states from justice and gods true worship lastly whatever in religion is holy and sublime in virtue amiable or grave whatever has passion or admiration in all the changes of that which is called fortune from without or the wily subtleties and refluxes of mans thoughts from within all these things with a solid and treatable smoothness to point out and describe teaching over the whole book of sanctity and virtue through all the instances of example with such delight to those especially of soft and delicious temper who will not so much as look upon truth her self unless they see her elegantly dressed that whereas the paths of honesty arid goodlife appear now rugged and difficult though they be indeed easy and pleasant they would then appear to all men both easy and pleasant though they were rugged and difficult indeed and what a benefit this would be to our youth and gentry  continues he may be soon guest by what we know of the corruption and bane which they suck in daily from the writings and interludes of libidinous and ignorant poetasters who having scarce ever heard of that which is the main consistence of a true poem the choice of such persons as they ought to introduce and what is moral and decent to each one do for the most part lap up vicious principles in sweet pills to be swallowed down and make the taste of virtuous documents harsh and four thus far goes milton and the reader may see that it was his opinion that tho poetry was in the main miserably sunk among us yet that it might be restored to its innocence and its greatness in order then to the doing this we come to display  secondly the method that we follow in the forementioned criticism we begin then with a criticism upon poetry in general in which we endeavor to show its nature and its end and the means which it ought to use for the attaining that end and then we come to divide poetry into its two great branches the greater and the less    we treat of the greater poetry show what its nature and its end are and that the only certain method for the attaining its end is the keeping strictly up to its nature which seems to have been hitherto not very clearly understood and here we shall lay down some general rules which are both few and short but eternal and unalterable and for the want of observing which it will appear throughout this whole treatise that the very best among the ancients and among the moderns have not only made gross mistakes but have deviated sometimes in a great degree from the art  and here too we endeavor to show the mutual dependence that the greater poetry has on religion and religion on the greater poetry and to make it appear that all those parts of the old testament which were writ id verse ought to be translated in verse by reasons which may have force enough to convince us that verse translated into prose is but half translated  when we have done this we come to heroic poetry which being a branch of the greater poetry must have the same end and must participate of the same nature and must besides have something particular in its nature to distinguish it from the other two branches which are tragedy and the greater ode but because too much bare speculation may prove tedious to several readers we show what every poet who writes an epick poem is obliged to do to make that poem keep to the nature of epick poetry in general and to its own this i say we endeavor to show not by laying down the rules after the common method but by showing what virgil has done because that great poet is so exact that he may be said to have written a criticism upon epick poetry by examples and because he is now by mr drydens translation to be reckoned among our own poets and so comes within the compass of my design  when by doing this we have laid down the rules we come briefly to examine whether those rules are always to be kept inviolable and if they are not in what parts and by whom they may be altered then we show how spencer by not following those rules fell so very far short of the ancients and afterward we endeavor to make it appear how milton by daring to break a little loose from them in some particulars kept up in several others to the nature of the greater poetry in general and of epick poetry in particular better than the best of the ancients after this we treat of the other english poets who have written any thing that comes near to heroic poetry and show of them all as we go along how they differ from one another how from the best of the ancient poets and the best of the moderns of other countries  the branch of the greater poetry which we consider next is tragedy which we treat of after the same manner with heroic poetry and show what every one who writes a tragedy is obliged to do to make that poem come up to the nature of the greater poetry in general and of tragedy in particular by showing what sophocles has done in his oedipus which will be there translated and for what reasons where we endeavor to display the beauties of his admirable conduct and to clear the moral by a very different method from what monsieur dacier has taken and after that by doing this we have laid down the rules the first of any length that were ever extant in english we by those examine the plays of our most celebrated tragic poets in their fables characters sentiments expressions harmony show what distinguishes them from one another from the best of the ancients and the most famous moderns of other countries and here we make it our business to show how much the present english stage is degenerated from the virtue and greatness of the ancient tragedy and what is to be done to restore modern tragedy first to the innocence and secondly to the greatness of the grecian stage and here we examine whether it is not possible to advance english tragedy to a greater height than ever the grecian poets arrived  in the next place we descend to the third and last branch of the greater poetry which is the greater ode which we treat of after the same manner with the two preceding and show what the composer of such an ode is obliged to do to make it keep up to the nature of the greater poetry in general and to its own and here we have occasion to take notice that of these three branches of poetry the ode is the most degenerated for since the nature of poetry consists in passion and that of the greater poetry in great passion as we make it appear in the forementioned crticism and since that which we commonly call passion is very rarely to be found in the greater ode it follows that the excellence of the greater ode must consist in extraordinary passion which can be nothing but strong enthusiasm but religion is the greatest noblest strongest source of enthusiasm as we very clearly show so that the modern ode by for saking religion and becoming for the most part profane has parted with that from which it derived its greatest excellence  and that the excellence of the greater ode is derived from religion we make appear not only by the examples of those very few which are admirable among our own but by those of pindar and horace and we show that the first of those great masters was so thoroughly convinced of this at the same time that he was obliged by the desire of gain to celebrate the triumphs of worthless coachmen and jockeys that his numerous extravagant digressions are to be attributed in a great measure to that conviction joined with that obligation when we have done this    we descend to the other division of poetry which is the less and shall treat of those branches of it in which our english poets are most concerned after the same method that we treated of those of the greater where first we shall speak of the little ode and show for what reasons our english poets have for the most part miscarried in it then we shall give the reader a large criticism upon comedy the first of any moment that will be extant upon it in any language and here we shall endeavor to make it appear that as the moderns have apparently the advantage of the ancients in comedy the english have it of the rest of the moderns  we shall end with a criticism upon satyr where we shall show the true difference between that and a libel or lampoon and the usefulness of the one and destructiveness of the other  thus have we laid before the reader the design and method of the work but because the discerning reader cannot but see that it is impossible for any bookseller to make it worth the undertakers trouble in employing so much time and thought as so great and important a design requires the lovers of criticism are therefore desired at least those who have spirit enough to promote so generous an undertaking to encourage it by their subscriptions at the rate of a guinea a book paying half a guinea down at the time of subscribing and half at the delivery of the book in quires the undertaker at the same time promising that not a book shall be printed more than the number subscribed  for the greater variety the lives of the several english poets will be added in their proper places  specimen being the substance of what will be said in the beginning of the criticism upon milton the next poet of whom we shall treat is milton one of the greatest and most daring geniuss that has appeared in the world and who has made his country a glorious present of the most lofty but most irregular poem that has been produced by the mind of man that great man had  desire to give the world something like an epick poem but he resolved at the same time to break through the rules of aristotle not that he was ignorant of them or contemned them on the contrary no man knew them better or esteemed them more because no man had an understanding that was more able to comprehend the necessity of them and therefore when he mentioned them in the little treatise which he wrote to mr hartlib he calls the art which treats of them a sublime art but at the same time he had discrenemnt enough to see that if he wrote a poem which was within the compass of them he should be subjected to the same fate which has attended all who have wrote epick poems ever since the time of homer and that is to be a copyist instead of an original it is true the epick poets who have lived since homer have most of them been originals in their fables which are the very souls of their poems but in their manner of treating those fables they have too frequently been copyists they have copyed the spirit and the images of homer even the great virgil himself is not to be excepted milton was the first who in the space of almost  000 years resolved for his countrys honor and his own to present the world with an original poem that is to say a poem that should have his own thoughts his own images and his own spirit in order to this he was resolved to write a poem that by virtue of its extraordinary subject cannot so properly be said to be against the rules as it may be affirmed to be above them all he had observed that aristotle had drawn his rules which he has given us for epick poetry from the reflections which he had made upon homer now he knew very well that in homer the action lay chiefly between man and man for achilles and hector are properly the principals and the gods are but seconds he was resolved therefore that his principals should be the devil on one side and man on the other and the devil is properly his hero because he gets the better all the persons in his poem excepting two are either divine or infernal so that most of the persons and particularly one of the principals being so very different from what homer or aristotle ever thought of could not possibly be subjected to their rules either for the characters or the incidents we shall now show for what reasons the choice of miltons subject as it set him free from the obligation which he lay under to the poetical laws so it necessarily threw him upon new thoughts new images and an original spirit in the next place we shall show that his thoughts his images and by consequence too his spirit are actually new and different from those of homer and virgil thirdly we shall show that besides their newness they have vastly the advantage of those of homer and virgil and we shall make this appear from several things but principally from the description of hell which has been described by those three great poets with all their force and with all their art after that we shall proceed to say something of miltons expression and his harmony and then we shall come to mark his defects with so much the more exactness because some of them ought to be avoided with the utmost caution as being so great that they would be insupportable in any one who had not his extraordinary distinguishing qualities  thus have we laid before the reader the design and method and specimen of the larger treatise it now remains that i should give an account why so small a part of it is published as soon as i set about the performance i easily foresaw that it would be a three years labor and the judicious reader upon considering the proposal cannot but be convinced of it yet after i had been for a whole year digesting my own thoughts and considering other peoples and making all sorts of preparations for the due execution of so great a design i saw that all the persons who had subscribed were they

active in the promoting of this design and if ten more had undertaken it with the same warmth that they did the whole design had been actually now finished my friends know very well that i was three months employed about that work after the last subscription came in and i appeal to them if it was not then high time to lay it  side for something that might be more beneficial i have printed all that i had by me entire to show that i was in very good earnest and that it was not my fault that i did not do the rest if i could but have leisure to go through with it there is nothing that i could undertake with greater satisfaction  the grounds of criticism in poetry chap i the design of the following treatise is the reestablishment of poetry the design of the ensuing treatise whether we consider the importance or the extent of it is perhaps the greatest in this kind of writing that has been conceived by the moderns for it is no less than an attempt to restore and reestablish the noblest art in every branch of it an art that by the barbarity of the times is fallen and sunk in them all and has been driven and banished from every country excepting england alone and is even here so miserably fallen for the most part by the extravagance of its professors and by the unskilfulness of its admirers that we have reason to apprehend it to be departing from hence too  that poetry is the noblest of all arts and by consequence the most instructive and most beneficial to mankind may be proved by the concording testimony of the greatest men who have lived in every age the greatest philosophers the greatest heroes and the greatest statesmen who have as it were unanimously cherished esteemed admired it and never has it been disesteemd or neglected by any but some pretenders to wisdom and by some contemptible politicasters persons who have got into the management of affairs only by the weakness of those who have employed them and who have utterly wanted capacity to know what a glorious use may be made of it for the benefit of civil society but in the sequel of this discourse by discovering the nature of poetry in general which seems to me to have been hitherto but little understood i shall clearly show its excellence and the importance of this undertaking and by laying down either the general rules of it or by tracing out that sublime art which to make use of miltons expression teaches what the laws are of a true epick poem what of a dramatick what of a lyrick what decorum is what is the grand masterpiece to observe i shall not only lay a good foundation for the judging of the performance of the several poets whose works i have undertaken to examine but shall as milton says in his treatise of education to mr hartlip soon make the world perceive what despicable creatures our common rhymers and playwrights are and show them what religious what glorious and magnificent use may be made of poetry both in divine and in human things  chap ii that poetry is to be established by laying down rules that an art so divine in its institution is sunk and profaned and miserably debased is a thing that is confessed by all but since poetry is fallen from the excellence which it once attained to it must be fallen either by the want of parts or want of industry or by the errors of its professors but that it cannot be for want of parts we have shown clearly in the advancement of modern poetry nor can it be supposed to be for want of industry since so many of its professors have no other dependence it remains then that it must have fallen by their errors and for want of being guided right since therefore it is for want of knowing by what rules they ought to proceed that poetry is fallen so low it follows then that it is the laying down of those rules alone that can reestablish it in short poetry is either an art or whimsie and fanaticism if it is an art it follows that it must propose an end to it self and afterward lay down proper means for the attaining that end for this is undeniable that there are proper means for the attaining of every end and those proper means in poetry we call the rules again if the end of poetry be to instruct and reform the world that is to bring mankind from irregularity extravagance and confusion to rule and order how this should be done by a thing that is in it self irregular and extravagant is difficult to be conceived besides the work of every reasonable creature must derive its beauty from regularity for reason is rule and order and nothing can be irregular either in our conceptions or our actions any further than it swerves from rule that is from reason as man is the more perfect the more he resembles his creator the works of man must needs be more perfect the more they resemble his makers now the works of god though infinitely various are extremely regular  the universe is regular in all its parts and it is to that exact regularity that it owes its admirable beauty the microcosm owes the beauty and health both of its body and soul to order and the deformity and distempers of both to nothing but the want of order man was created like the rest of the creatures regular and as long as he remained so he continued happy but as soon as he fell from his primitive state by transgressing order weakness and misery was the immediate consequence of that universal disorder that immediately followedin his conceptions in his passions and actions  the great design of arts is to restore the decays that happened to humane nature by the fall by restoring order the design of logic is to bring back order and rule and method to our conceptions the want of which causes most of our ignorance and all our errors the design of moral philosophy is to cure the disorder that is found in our passions from which proceeds all our unhappiness and all our vice as from the due order that is seen in them comes all our virtue and all our pleasure but how should these arts reestablish order unless they themselves were regular those arts that make the senses instrumental to the pleasure of the mind as painting and music do it by a great deal of rule and order since therefore poetry comprehends the force of all these arts of logic of ethics of eloquence of painting of music can any thing be more ridiculous than to imagine that poetry it self should be without rule and order  chap iii what poetry is and that it attains its end by exciting of passion we have said above that as poetry is an art it must have a certain end and that there must be means that are proper for the attaining that end which means are otherwise called the rules but that we may make this appear the more plainly let us declare what poetry is poetry then is an art by which a poet excites passion and for that very cause entertains sense in order to satisfy and improve to delight and reform the mind and so to make mankind happier and better from which it appears that poetry has two ends a subordinate and a final one the subordinate one is pleasure and the final one is instruction  first the subordinate end of poetry is to please for that pleasure is the business and design of poetry is evident because poetry unless it pleases nay and pleases to a height is the most contemptible thing in the world other things may be born with if they are indifferent but poetry unless it is transporting is abominable nay it has only the name of poetry so inseparable is pleasure from the very nature of the thing  but secondly the final end of poetry is to reform the manners as poetry is an art instruction must be its final end but either that instruction must consist in reforming the manners or it cannot instruct at all and consequently be an art for poetry pretends to no other instruction as its final end but since the final end of poetry is to reform the manners nothing can be according to the true art of it which is against religion or which runs counter to moral virtue or to the true politics and to the liberty of mankind and every thing which is against the last tends to the corruption and destruction of mankind and consequently every thing against the last must be utterly inconsistent with the true art of poetry  now the proper means for poetry to attain both its subordinate and final end is by exciting passion first the subordinate end of poetry which is to please is attained by exciting passion because every one who is pleased is moved and either desires or rejoices or admires or hopes or the like as we are moved by pleasure which is happiness to do every thing we do we may find upon a little reflection that every man is incited by some passion or other either to action or to contemplation and passion is the result either of action or of contemplation as long as either of them please and the more either of them pleases the more they are attended with passion the satisfaction that we receive from geometry it self comes from the joy of having found out truth and the desire of finding more and the satiety that seises us upon too long a lecture proceeds from nothing but from the weariness of our spirits and consequently from the cessation or the decay of those two pleasing passions but  secondly poetry attains its final end which is the reforming the minds of men by exciting of passion and here i dare be bold to affirm that all instruction whatever depends upon passion the moral philosophers themselves even the dryest of them can never instruct and reform unless they move for either they make vice odious and virtue lovely or they deter you from one by the apprehension of misery or they incite you to the other by the happiness they make you expect from it or they work upon your shame or upon your pride or upon your indignation and therefore poetry instructs and reforms more powerfully than philosophy can do because it moves more powerfully and therefore it instructs more easily too for whereas all men have passions and great passions of one sort or another and whereas those passions will be employed and whatever way they move they that way draw the man it follows that philosophy can instruct but hardly because it moves but gently for the violent passions not finding their account in those faint emotions begin to rebel and fly to their old objects whereas poetry at the same time that it instructs us powerfully must reform us easily because it makes the very violence of the passions contribute to our reformation for the generality of mankind are apparently swayed by their passions nay and perhaps the very best and wisest of them the greatest philosophers and the greatest princes are influenced by their favorites and so are the wisest magistrates and it is for this reason that not only the devil who must be supposed to understand human nature corrupts mankind by their passions for temptation is nothing but the inclining men to such and such actions by the raising such and such passions in them but god himself who made the soul and best understands its nature converts it by its passions for whereas philosophy pretends to correct human passions by human reason that is things that are strong and ungovernable by something that is feeble and weak poetry by the force of the passion instructs and reforms the reason which is the design of the true religion as we have shown in another place so that we have here already laid down one great rule necessary for the succeeding in poetry for since it can attain neither its subordinate nor its final end without exciting of passion it follows that where there is nothing which directly tends to the moving of that there can be no poetry and that consequently a poet ought to contrive every thing in order to the moving of passion that not only the fable the incidents and characters but the very sentiments and the expressions ought all to be designed for that for since poetry pleases and instructs us more even than philosophy it self only because it moves us more it follows that the more poetry moves the more it pleases and instructs and it is for this reason that tragedy to those who have a taste of it is both more pleasing and more instructing than comedy and this naturally brings us to the dividing poetry into the greater and the less    the greater poetry is an art by which a poet justly and reasonably excites great passion that he may please and instruct and comprehends epick tragic and the greater lyrick poetry    the less poetry is an art by which a poet excites less passion for the forementioned ends and includes in it comedy and satyr and the little ode and elegiack and pastoral poems but first we shall treat of the former  chap iv what the greater poetry is what enthusiasm is the greater poetry then is an art by which a poet justly and reasonably excites great passion in order to please and instruct and make mankind better and happier so that the first and grand rule in the greater poetry is that a poet must every where excite great passion but in some branches of the greater poetry it is impossible for a poet every where to excite in a very great degree that which we vulgarly call passion as in the ode for example and in the narration of the epick poem it follows then that there must be two sorts of passion first that which we call vulgar passion and secondly enthusiasm  first vulgar passion or that which we commonly call passion is that which is moved by the objects themselves or by the ideas in the ordinary course of life i mean that common society which we find in the world as for example anger is moved by an affront that is offered us in our presence or by the relation of one pity by the sight of a mournful object or the relation of one admiration or wonder the common passion i mean for there is an enthusiastic admiration as we shall find anon by the sight of a strange object or the relation of one but  secondly enthusiastic passion or enthusiasm is a passion which is moved by the ideas in contemplation or the meditation of things that belong not to common life most of our thoughts in meditation are naturally attended with some sort and some degree of passion and this passion if it is strong i call enthusiasm now the enthusiastic passions are chiefly six admiration terror horror joy sadness desire caused by ideas occuring to us in meditation and producing the same passions that the objects of those ideas would raise in us if they were set before us in the same light that those ideas give us of them and here i desire the reader to observe that ideas in meditation are often very different from what ideas of the same objects are in the course of common conversation as for example the sun mentioned in ordinary conversation gives the idea of a round flat shining body of about two foot diameter but the sun occurring to us in meditation gives the idea of avast and glorious body and the top of all the visible creation and the brightest material image of the divinity i leave the reader therefore to judge if this idea must not necessarily be attended with admiration and that admiration i call enthusiasm so thunder mentioned in common conversation gives an idea of a black cloud and a great noise which makes no great impression upon us but the idea of it occurring in meditation sets before us the most forcible most resistless and consequently the most dreadful phenomenon in nature so that this idea must move a great deal of terror in us and it is this sort of terror that i call enthusiasm and it is this sort of terror or admiration or horror and so of the rest which expressed in poetry make that spirit that passion and that fire which so wonderfully please  thus there are two sorts of passions to be raised in poetry the vulgar and the enthusiastic to which last the vulgar is preferable because all men are capable of being moved by the vulgar and a poet writes to all but the enthusiastic are more subtle and thousands have no feeling and no notion of them but where the vulgar cannot be moved in a great degree there the enthusiastic are to be raised therefore in those parts of epick poetry where the poet speaks himself or the eldest of the muses for him the enthusiastic passions are to prevail as likewise in the greater ode and the vulgar passions are to prevail in those parts of an epick and dramatick poem where the poet introduces persons holding conversation together and perhaps this might be one reason for which aristotle might prefer tragedy to epick poetry because the vulgar passions prevail more in it and are more violently moved in it and therefore tragedy must necessarily both please and instruct more generally than epick poetry we shall then treat of the vulgar passions when we come to speak of tragedy in which poem they ought most to prevail we shall then more particularly show the surest and most powerful ways of raising compassion and terror which are the true tragical passions  we shall at present treat of the enthusiastic passions and how they are to be raised we have taken notice above that they are to be moved by ideas occurring in contemplation that they are to be moved in a great degree and yet justly and reasonably we shall now show that the strongest enthusiastic passions that are justly and reasonably raised must be raised by religious ideas that is by ideas which either show the attributes of the divinity or relate to his worship and this we shall endeavor to prove  st by reason  ly by authority  ly by examples  first we shall endeavor to prove it by reason since the foresaid passions are to be moved in a great degree and are to be moved by their ideas it follows that to be justly and reasonably moved they must be moved by great ideas and therefore the stronger the enthusiasm is the greater must the ideas be now those ideas are certainly the greatest which are worthiest to move the greatest and the wisest men for there the enthusiastic passions in poetry are truly admirable when the greater and more violent they are the more they show the largeness of soul and greatness of capacity of the writer for men are moved for two reasons either because they have weak minds and souls that are capable of being moved by little objects and consequently by little and ordinary ideas or because they have greatness of soul and capacity to discern and feel the great ones for the enthusiastic passions being caused by the ideas it follows that the more the soul is capable of receiving ideas whose objects are truly great and wonderful the greater will the enthusiasm be that is caused by those ideas from whence it follows that the greater the soul is and the larger the capacity the more will it be moved by religious ideas which are not only great and wonderful but which almost alone are great and wonderful to a great and wise man and which never fail to move very strongly unless it is for want of due reflection or want of capacity in the subject  since therefore the enthusiasm in the greater poetry is to hold proportion with the ideas and those ideas are certainly the greatest which are worthiest to move the greatest and the wisest men and divine ideas or ideas which show the attributes of god or relate to his worship are worthiest to move the greatest and the wisest men because such ideas belong to objects which are only truly above them and consequently truly admirable desirable joyful terrible etc it follows that the greatest and strongest enthusiasm that can be employed in poetry is only justly and reasonably to be derived from religious ideas  but here we desire the readers leave to make this observation that since religious and divine ideas or ideas which show the attributes or relate to the worship of the divinity are the worthiest to move the greatest and the wisest men and the greater and wiser the men are the more they must move and raise them as for example the greater and more comprehensive the soul is which reflects upon the idea of god the more that idea must fill that soul with admiration it follows that as great passion only is the adequate language of the greater poetry so the greater poetry is only the adequate language of religion and that therefore the greatest passion is the language of that sort of poetry because that sort of poetry is the worthiest language of religion  but secondly we shall proceed to prove by authority that the strongest enthusiastic passions in poetry are only justly and reasonably to be raised by religious ideas and this we shall show by the authority of the greatest critics among the ancients aristotle hermogenes and longinus  first aristotle says in the third book of his rhetoric cap ii and iii that the frequent use of metaphors dialects epithets is a great deal fitter for poetry than it is for prose because they are the language of passion and poetry is more passionate or more enthusiastic than prose for this reason because the persons and the things of which poetry treats are many degrees above those which are the subjects of prose now all the world knows that the graecians treated of the greatest human persons and things in their prose but that poetry was a language which they reserved for their gods and for the things which related to them and i am apt to believe that poetry from hence was called the language of the gods because when ever the graecians in the poetical times introduced their gods speaking they were sure to speak in verse but  secondly hermogenes in the vi chapter of the first book of his treatise concerning the forms of speech tells us that there are four kind of thoughts or ideas or conceptions which were proper to give that elevation and gravity to a discourse which by their union compose that quality in writing which we call majesty    the first and principal of them are all such thoughts or ideas of god as are worthy of the divinity not like some of the homerical conceptions of jupiter which says hermogenes being more human than divine and unworthy of the divinity are contrary to true majesty    next to these the conceptions which give elevation and gravity and consequently majesty to a discourse are such thoughts or ideas concerning the works of god as are worthy the divine workmanship    the third sort of conceptions are of such things as are indeed themselves divine but they are such emanations of divinity as are to be seen in men as justice temperance fortitude nature law and the like to which may be added number power and might    the fourth sort are of things that indeed are human but are reputed great and illustrious as conquest riches nobility place etc but here i desire the reader to observe that hermogenes is here speaking concerning pieces of eloquence and such discourses as are writ in prose for it is certain that these last ideas as they are of things that are merely human can never afford the greatest spirit that can be employed in poetry for as the objects themselves are not truly great because as longinuus says a man who has it in his power to possess them shows himself great by contemning them it is impossible that a spirit that is very great can flow from these ideas because the spirit that is very great must hold proportion with its ideas as the ideas must with their objects and therefore these ideas cannot be great because their objects are not great we ought now in the third place to proceed to the authority of longinus but that we may diversifie this treatise the more and make it the more entertaining we shall first show examples of the several kinds of the forementioned thoughts producing that sort of spirit in poetry which we call enthusiastic admiration and that we may show the reader more plainly how that spirit is produced we shall set before him as near as we can such kind of thoughts as inspire the soul with admiration alone uncomplicated with terror or any other passion  these thoughts or ideas which produce that enthusiasm which we call admiration are thoughts or ideas which hold some proportion with such objects as in their nature are truly admirable those thoughts or ideas are of two sorts ideas of sounds and ideas of things we shall then have occasion to treat of ideas of sounds when we come to speak of terror and some of the other enthusiastic passions we shall at present treat of such ideas of things as are proper to excite admiration  we have shown that hermogenes in the first rank of these reckons those thoughts and ideas of god that are worthy of the creator such is the invocation of milton in the beginning of paradise lost  and chiefly thou o spirit that do prefer before all temples the upright heart and pure instruct me for thou know thou from the first wast present and with mighty wings overspread dovelike satst brooding on the vast abyss and made it pregnant what in me is dark illumin what is low raise and support that to the height of this great argument i may assert eternal providence and justify the ways of god to men and that it was these divine ideas that raised his soul and filled it with admiration and with a noble greatness which passion expressed makes the greatness of the spirit the reader who goes back to the beginning of the poem will find no manner of room to doubt for milton like a master begins with a gentle spirit which he continues for the twelve first lines in the thirteenth where he speaks of the boldness of his attempt he begins to rise and in the nineteenth where he talks of the power of the holy ghost he is quite upon the wing  instruct me for thou know thou from the first and such are the thoughts concerning god which are spread through that divine dialogue between god and adam in the eighth book of the same poem i believe the reader will pardon the length if i repeat it which i am very much inclined to do not only because i challenge the most zealous admirers of antiquity to produce any thing like it from among all the dialogues in homer and virgil that are between either a god or a man or between one god and another but because the reader who sees the inequalities in it will easily see that it derives its greatness and its sublimity from the becoming thoughts which it has of the deity that the reader may thoroughly understand it without turning to the book the occasion of it is this adam relating the history of the creation to the angel raphael tells him how after he had given names to the birds and the beasts which god had brought before him for that purpose he who understood their natures and saw none of them was fit for his conversation desired of god in the following words a partner fit for humane society  o by what name for thou above all these above mankind or ought than mankind higher surpassest far my naming how may i adore thee author of this universe and all this good to man for whose well being so amply and with hands so liberal thou have provided all things but with me i see not who partakes in solitude what happiness who can enjoy alone or all enjoying what contentment find thus i presumptuous and the vision bright as with a smile more brightned thus replied here by the way i desire the reader to observe how the spirit of the poem sinks when adam comes from god to himself and how it rises again when he returns to his creator but let us proceed to gods reply  what callst thou solitude is not the earth with various living creatures and the air replenisht and all these at thy command to come and play before thee know thou not their language and their ways they also know and reason not contemptibly with these find pastime and bear rule thy realm is large so spoke the universal lord and seemed so ordering i with leave of speech implored and humble deprecation thus replied let not my words offend thee heavenly power my maker be propitious while i speak have not thou made me here thy substitute and these inferior far beneath me set among unequals what society can sort what harmony or true delight which must be mutual in proportion due given and received but in disparity the one intense the other still remiss cannot well suit with either but soon prove tedious alike of fellowship i speak such as i seek fit to participate all rational delight wherein the brute cannot be humane consort they rejoice each with their kind lion with lioness so fitly them in pairs thou have combined much less can bird with beast or fish with fowl so well converse nor with the ox the ape worse then can man with beast and least of all whereto the almighty answered not displeased a nice and subtle happiness i see thou to thy self proposest in the choice of thy associates adam and wilt taste no pleasure though in pleasure solitary what think thou then of me and this my state seem i to thee sufficiently possessed of happiness or not who am alone from all eternity for none i know second to me or like equal much less how have i then with whom to hold converse save with the creatures which i made and those to me inferior infinite descents beneath what other creatures are to thee the reader may easily see that here is all that is great and sublime in reason expressed with the spirit of that just admiration with which such worthy thoughts of the deity must naturally fill the soul but now let us see adams answer  he ceased i lowly answered to attain the height and depth of thy eternal ways all humane thoughts come short supreme of things thou in thy self art perfect and in thee is no deficience found not so is man but in degree the cause of his desire by conversation with his like to help or solace his defects no need that thou should propagate already infinite and through all numbers absolute though one but man by number is to manifest his single imperfection and beget like of his like his image multiplied in unity defective which requires collateral love and dearest amity thou in thy secresy although alone best with thy self accompanied seekst not social communication yet so pleased can raise thy creature to what height thou will of union or communion deifid i by conversing cannot these erect from prone nor in their ways complaisence find what milton says of the son of god hymnd by the angels in the third book of that poem is very lofty and elevated  thee next they sang of all creation first begotten son divine similitude in whose conspicuous countenance without cloud made visible the almighty father shines whom else no creature can behold on thee impressed the effulgence of his glory abides tranfusd in thee his ample spirit rests he heaven of heavens and all the powers therein by thee created and by thee threw down the aspiring dominations thou that day thy fathers dreadful thunder did not spare nor stop thy flaming chariot wheels that shook heavens everlasting frame while over the necks thou drovst of warring angels disarrayd i have the rather mentioned these verses to show that milton was a little tainted with socinianism for by the first verse it is evident that he looked upon the son of god as a created being the last thing that i shall mention is what god says of himself in the seventh book for speaking of chaos he says that is boundless because he is infinite  boundless the deep because i am who fill infinitude nor vacuous the space though i uncircumscribd my self retire and put not forth my goodnese which is free to act or not necessity and chance approach not me and what i will is fate i could add an infinite number of examples if it were not altogether needless for what has been said may suffice to show that a poet who intends to give that elevation and that gravity to his poem which compose majesty can fetch his ideas from no object so proper as from god for as great elevation must be produced by a great admiration as every passion which the poet excites ought to be just and reasonable and adapted to its object it is impossible that any one who is not stupid can seriously contemplate his maker but that his soul must be exalted and lifted up toward its primitive objects and be filled and inspired with the highest admiration for it is then that the enthusiasm in poetry is wonderful and divine when it shows the excellence of the authors discernment and the largeness of his soul now all the ideas of god are such that the more large and comprehensive the soul of a poet is and the more it is capable of receiving those ideas the more is it sure to be raised and filled and lifted to the skies with wonder the spirit or the passion in poetry ought to be proportioned to the ideas and the ideas to the object and when it is not so it is utterly false and therefore when ever in poetry there is a great spirit which is derived from ideas whose objects are unworthy to move the soul of a great and a wise man there that spirit is either false or at least has nothing sublimely admirable in it but nothing but god and what relates to god is worthy to move the soul of a great and a wise man but let us proceed to consider the glorious works of the creator which next to himself are worthy to move with admiration all who are worthy to be called wise because these when they are reflected upon by the great and the wise never fail to declare his eternal power and godhead our religion tells us that the first the greatest and most glorious of his works are the angels who whether we consider their power their swiftness their science or their sanctity are fit objects of our admiration and consequently of lofty and elevated poetry let us see then how tasso describes the angel gabriel and his descent in the first canto of the hyerusalemme  stan xiii cosi parlogli and gabriels accinse veloce ad essequir limposte cose la sua forma inuissibil d aria cinse et al senso mortal la sottopose humane membra aspetto human si finse ma di celeste maesta il compose tra giouane e fanciullo eta confine prese and orno diraggi il biondo crine stan xiv ali bianche uesti chan dor le cime infaticabilmente agili e priest fend i uenti e le nubi e ua sublime soura la terra e soura il mar con queste cosi uestito indirizzossi a l i am parti del mondo il messggier celeste pria sul libano monte ei si ritenne e si libro su padeguate pen and thus it is translated by fairfax who though he by no means shows all the spirit and beauty of the original yet even in his antiquated version he discovers something of them  stan xiii this said the angel swift himself prepared to execute the charge imposed aright in form of aerie members fair embard his spirits pure were subject to our sight like to a man in show and shape he fared but full of heavenly majesty and might a stripling seemed he thrice five winters old and radiant beams adorned his locks of gold stan xiv of silver wings he took a shining pair fringed with gold unwearied nimble swift with these he parts the winds the clouds the air and over seas and earth himself does lift thus clad he cut the spheres and circles fair and the pure skies with sacred feathers cleft on libanon at first his foot he set and shook his wings with roary maydews wet but let us now consider michaels descent in the night in the ninth canto of the hierusalemme  stan lxii venia scotendo con leterne piume la caligine densa e i cupi horrori sindoraua la notte al divine lume che spargea scintillando il uolto fuori tale il sol ne le nubi ha per costume spiegar dopo la pioggia i bei colori tal suol fendendo il liquido sereno stella cader de la gran madre in seno which in english is as follows  and as he flew the darkness of his way and the black horrors of the dreary sky he shaking his eternal wings dispersed old night illustrated her dusky face with rays which his celestial eyes diffused thus breaking through a storm the lord of day the clouds with purple and with gold adorns and thus a star from the nocturnal heaven into the lap of our great mother falls where the reader may take notice that the comparison of the sun to michael the prince of the archangels is extremely just and noble because the top of the visible is admirably likend to the top of the invisible creation but in the two last verses tasso has injudiciously been guilty of an anticlimax but now let us see how milton describes the descent of raphael to paradise in the fifth book of paradise lost  down thither prone in flight he speeds and through the vast aetherial sky ails between worlds and worlds with steady wing now on the polar winds then with quick fann winnows the buxom air till within soar f towering eagles to all the fowls he seems  phaenix gazed by all as that sole bird when to enshrine his relics in the suns right temple to egyptian thebes he flies at once on the eastern cliff of paradise he lights and to his proper shape returns a seraph winged six wings he wore to shade his lineaments divine the pair that clad each shoulder broad came mantling over his breast with regal ornament the middle pair girt like a starry zone his wast and round kirted his loins and thighs with downy gold and colors dipped in heaven the third his feet hadowed from either heel with feathered mail sky tinctured grain like maias son he stood and shoke his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled the circuit wide thus the reader may see by what has been said that the ideas of angels are exceeding proper to raise enthusiastic admiration as being the most glorious and admirable beings of the creation and which lead the soul immediately to its creator next to these come the other creatures of the immaterial world as demons apparitions of all sorts and more particularly the spirits of men departed then follow prophecies visions miracles enchantments prodigies and all things which have an immediate relation to the wonders of another world of most of which we shall give examples when we come to speak of terror because they are rather wonderful than they are admirable we name those things wonderful which we admire with fear  the next ideas that are most proper to produce the enthusiasm of admiration are the great phenomenon of the material world because they too lead the soul to its maker and show as the apostle says his eternal power and godhead as the heavens and heavenly bodies the sun the moon the stars and the immensity of the universe and the motions of the heaven and earth witness what milton says of the sun when he describes the descent of satan from heaven gates to paradise lib    above them all the golden sun in splendour likest heaven allured his eye thither his course he bends through the calm firmament but up or down by center or eccentrick hard to tell or longitude where the great luminary aloof the vulgar constellations thick that from his lordly eye keep distance due dispences light from far they as they move their starry dance in numbers that compute days months and years toward his all chearing lamp turn swift their various motions or are turned by his magnetic beam that gently warms the universe but to show how very much these fall short of the immaterial creation a poet that he may make them more admirable contrives to give spirit and soul to them  where the great luminarie aloof the vulgar constellations thick that from his lordly eye keep distance due dispences light from far and in that noble apostrophe to the sun the devil makes in the beginning of the third book  o thou that with surpassing glory crowned look from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world at whose sight all the stars hide their diminisht heads etc and in that admirable passage in the seventh book where adam desires the angel to give him an account of the creation  if unforbid thou may unfold what we not to explore the secrets ask of his eternal empire but the more to magnify his works the more we know and the great light of day yet wants to run much of his race though steep suspense in heaven held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears and longer will delay to hear thee tell his generation and the rising birth of nature from the unapparent deep and in the apostrophe to the sun in the fourth aeneid  sol qui terrarum flammis opera omnia lustras which is in english  great god of day that with thy flaming beams viewst and illuminatst at once a world and in what milton says of the moon in the fourth of paradise lost  hesperus that led the starry host rode brightest till the moon rising in clouded majesty at length apparent queen unvailed her peerless light and over the dark her silver mantle threw for the stars and the immensity of the universe i desire the reader would give me leave to bring an example from the paraphrase upon the te deum where thus the angel speaks to god  where ever at utmost stretch we cast our eyes through the vast frightful spaces of the skies even there we find thy glory there we gaze on thy bright majestys unbounded blaze on thy bright majestys unbounded blaze ten thousand suns prodigious globes of light at once in broad dimensions strike our sight millions behind in the remoter skies appear but spangles to our wearied eyes and when our wearied eyes want farther strength to pierce the voids immeasurable length our vigorous towering thoughts still farther fly and still remoter flaming worlds descry but even an angels comprehensive thought cannot extend so far as thou have wrought our vast conceptions are by swelling brought swallowed and lost in infinite to naught the idea of the worlds immensity is very proper to produce admiration as leading us to the glory of the creator the use that milton makes of it in the eighth book of paradise lost  and for the heavens wide circuit let it speak the makers high magnificence who built so spacious and his line stretched out so far that man may know he dwells not in his own an edifice too large for him to fill lodged in a small partition and the rest ordained for uses to his lord best known and tasso finely makes use of that noble idea to repress the pride and ambition of man it is in the   th canto of the gierusalemme where hugo bids godfrey who had been rapt up to heaven in a vision look down from the firmament to the earth  stan ix china poi disse e gli addito la terra gli occhi a cio che quel globo ultimo serra x quanto e uil la cagion cha la uirtude humana e cola giu premio e contrasto in the picciolo cerchio e fra che nude solitudini e stretto il uostro fasto lei come isola il mare intorno chiude e lui chor ocean chiamate hor uasto nulla eguale a tai nomi ha in se di magno ma e bassa palude e breue stagno stan xi cosi l un disse e l altro in giuso i lumi volse quasi sdegnoso e ne sorrise che uide un punto sol mar terre e fiumi che qui paion distinti in tante guise et ammiro che pur l p ombre a i fumi la nostra folle humanita s affise seruo imperio cercando e muta fama ne miri il ciel ch a se ninuita e chiama the following verses of milton in the eighth of paradise lost concerning the magnitude and the motions of the heavens and earth derive a lofty spirit from their subject for there says adam  when i behold this goodly frame this world of heaven and earth consisting and compute their magnitudes this earth a spot a grain an atom with the firmament compared and all her numbered stars that seem to roll spaces incomprehensible for such their distance argues and their swift return diurnal i could here bring examples of the same kind of spirit derived in due proportion from ideas of sublunary things as of the four elements water earth air fire winds and meteors of all sorts seas rivers mountains but i am afraid of running into length and heaping too many citations one upon another besides it will be very convenient to make two or three remarks here  first that the wonders of the universe afford the more admirable ideas and a more admirable spirit the more they show the attributes of the creator or relate to his worship secondly that na ural philosophy is absolutely necessary to a poet not only that he may adorn his poem with the useful knowledge it affords but because the more he knows the immense phenomenon of the universe the more he will be sure to admire them for the more we know of things that are never to be comprehended by us the more that knowledge must make them appear wonderful the third remark that i shall make is this that they to whom nature has given that happy elevation of thought which alone can make a great poet will often be directed by that tendency to greatness which they have within them to ideas from which they may derive a lofty spirit yet i shall show by the example of milton that they may often very grossly fail for want of a certain knowledge of the objects from which they are to draw their ideas for it is for want of that knowledge that milton has done the most unartful thing that perhaps ever was done in the two or three last books of the greatest poem that ever was written by man for whereas in the first eight books he had by the mouth of god or angels or of man the companion of angels divinely entertained us with the wondrous works of god in the latter end of his poem and more particularly in the last book he makes an angel entertain us with the works of corrupted man from which it is very plain by what has been delivered above concerning the nature of enthusiastic passion that that angel could draw no sort of enthusiasm and least of all that of admiration and terror which give the principal greatness and elevation to poetry for how flat how low and unmusical is the relation of the actions of fallen man in the  0th lib though delivered by the voice of divinity  on adam last thus judgment he pronounced because thou have hearkened to the voice of thy wife and eaten of the tree concerning which i charged thee saying thou shall not eat thereof cursed is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow shall eat thereof all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth untilled and thou shall eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for thou out of the ground wast taken know thy birth for dust thou art and shall to dust return the late mr dryden with a great deal of injustice used to attribute the flatness of milton in this and some other passages to his getting into a tract of scripture as he was pleased to express himself whereas the thing that made him sink was plainly the poorness and lowness of the ideas for how could the works of corrupted man afford any other to god or angels but what lofty what glorious ideas does a religious mention of the works of god afford to man in his primitive state in that incomparable hymn in the fifth book of the same paradise lost a hymn which though it is entirely taken from scripture for it is apparently the     psalm yet will always stand alone the phoenix of lofty hymns and nothing equal to it no nor second to it can ever be produced from the grecian writers of hymns it is impossible i can do a greater pleasure to the reader who either has not read or does not remember milton than to insert it here  these are thy glorious works parent of good almighty thine this universal frame thus wondrous fair thy self how wondrous then unspeakable who sitst above these heavens to us invisible or dimly seen in these thy lowest works yet these declare thy goodness beyond thought and power divine speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light angels for ye behold him and with songs and chorall symphonies day without night circle his throne rejoicing ye in heaven on earth join all the creatures to extol him

us only good and if the night have gathered ought of evil or concealed disperse it as now light dispels the dark it is easy to discern here with how much more divinity milton makes a man speak concerning the works of god than he makes even the creator himself speak concerning the works of man but here if the reader will pardon a digression i shall make an observation which may not be disagreeable to him the observation is this that all the passages in paradise lost where god is introduced speaking are flat to the reserve of those in which he speaks of himself upon enquiring into the reason of it i found that according to the account which i have given of poetical enthusiasm or of the spirit of poetry it is nothing but that admiration and terror and the rest of those enthusiastical passions which are produced by their proper ideas and which are to hold proportion with their ideas as their ideas must with their objects now nothing is more impossible than that god should either fear or admire his own creatures but where milton makes him speak concerning himself or his infinite power there he makes him speak with a great spirit as in that passage of the sixth book where he speaks to his son  go then thou mightiest in thy fathers might ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels that shake heavens basis bring forth all my war my bow and thunder my almighty arms it is plain that here the poet is guilty of a mistake but indeed a mistake that is almost unavoidable for it is the admiration and terror that make the spirit in the preceding verses and it is impossible to conceive the ideas without feeling the passions so that milton while he was rapt with admiration and moved with terror by the ideas which he had conceived shifts persons insensibly and forgetting who speaks expresses himself with those passions which indeed are proper enough in the poet but never can be so in the deity for neither his bow nor his almighty arms his thunder nor the rapid wheels that shake heavens basis can be in the least admirable or terrible to the divinity so that mr cowley is certainly in the right in his notes upon his davideis where he tells us that god is to be introduced speaking simply and this puts me in mind of an extraordinary argument of monsieur paschal proving the divinity of our savior by the simplicity of his style for says he our savior speaks of the sublimest subjects even the glories of the kingdom of heaven without being moved at all which shows that he was really god for suppose a peasant says he or an ordinary man should be carried to the court of some prince as for example the great mogul and there be shown all his riches his pomp and his power this peasant at his return would certainly speak of these things in extravagant terms in terms that would sufficiently declare his transport but if the mogul himself was to speak of them he who had been always usd to them would speak without any emotion so says monsieur paschal if any one else had delivered any thing concerning the glories of the kingdom of heaven he would certainly have done it with transport nay though he had been a fanatic or an impostor for let those divine ideas come how they will it is impossible for man to think of them without being ravished by them but our savior who was god and who consequently had been used to them from all eternity spoke of them unconcerned  but let us come to the third sort of thoughts which hermogenes says are proper to give elevation and gravity to a discourse and those are things which indeed are divine says but are often beheld in men these emanations of divinity are the virtues such as temperance justice fortitude magnanimity or nature law power and the like and we should never make an end if we should give examples of all the passages whose greatness of spirit is derived from these ideas but for the readers entertainment we shall mention a few  the power of ruling our own minds which may be referred to temperance gives noble ideas and consequently a noble spirit as we may see by the second ode of the second book of horace  latius regnes avidum domando spiritum quam si lybiam remotis gadibus jungas and uterque paenus serviat uni which in english is thus  thou a more absolute command shall gain a larger nobler empire shall obtain if thy wild lust of power thou can restrain than if to spain thy conquernig troops should join the moors that fry beneath the parching line and both the carthaginians should be thine and the idea of fortitude affords too a noble spirit as we may see in the twelfth of the aeneis where turnus replies to aeneas who upbraids him with fear  non me tua feruida terrent dicta ferox dij me terrent and jupiter hostis it is true i am afraid but not of thee nor thy vain threatening words insulting man the gods alone can frighten me and jove who now declares against me and that is a very remarkable passage in the fifteenth stanza of the fourth canto of the gierusalemme for after pluto had demanded of the assembled fiends if they will stand idle and suffer the christian armies to throw down their altars and destroy their worship he adds  ah non fia uer che non sono anco estinti i spirti in uoi di quel ualr primiero uando di ferro e d alte fiamme cinti gnammo gia contra il celeste impero fummo io nol nego in questo conflitto vinti pur non manco uirtute al gran pensiero hebbero i piu felici al hor uittoria rimase a noi d inuitto ardir la gloria which in english is thus  ah never let it be ye assembled gods for still we still the unconquered spirit feel of that eternal valor when of old begirt with shining arms and brighter flames against the omnipotent we daring fought it is true we lost the day but not for want of valor equal to the vast design fortune gave him the field the immortal fame was ours of having made the brave attempt the immortal fame was ours who still retain that fire invincible with which we fought and dared what never angels durst before from which milton has apparently borrowed part of lucifers speech in the first book of paradise lost  what though the field be lost all is not lost the unconquerable will and study of revenge immortal hate and courage never to submit or yield and in armidas speech to godfrey canto  th stanza    tasso derives a noble spirit from godfreys power and justice  tu cui cocesse il cielo e dielti in fate voleril giusto e poter cio che uuoi which is in english  then for whom dooming heaven has made it fate that thy designs should still be just and thou should never want power to act those vast designs and from the magnanimity of rinaldo in the fourteenth stanza of the fifth canto  onde cosi rispose i primi gradi piu meritar che conseguir desio ne pur che me le mia uirtu sublimi di scettri altezza inuidiar deggio in english  rinaldo answered thus the foremost rank i rather would deserve than would obtain and can contemn the scepters held by all whose fame to my superior virtue yields the fourth sort of thoughts which hermogenes mentions as riches nobility place office rank and the like we shall purposely pass by without giving examples of them because we shall have a particular occasion to do it hereafter let us now pass to the next enthusiastic passion which is terror than which if it is rightly managed none is more capable of giving a great spirit to poetry this passion scarce ever goes by itself but is always more or less complicated with admiration for every thing that is terrible is great at least to him to whom it is terrible it is now our business to show two things first what this enthusiastic terror is and secondly from what ideas it is chiefly to be derived  first let us show what this sort of enthusiasm is and in order to that let us show as briefly as we can what the common passion is which we call terror fear then or terror is a disturbance of mind proceeding from the apprehension of an approaching evil threatening destruction or very great trouble either to us or ours and when the disturbance comes suddenly with surprise let us call it terror when gradually fear things then that are powerful and likely to hurt are the causes of common terror and the more they are powerful and likely to hurt the more they become the causes of terror which terror the greater it is the more it is joined with wonder and the nearer it comes to astonishment thus we have shown what objects of the mind are the causes of common terror and the ideas of those objects are the causes of enthusiastic terror  let us now show from what ideas this enthusiastic terror is chiefly to be derived the greatest enthusiastic terror then must needs be derived from religious ideas for since the more their objects are powerful and likely to hurt the greater terror their ideas produce what can produce a greater terror than the idea of an angry god which puts me in mind of that admirable passage of homer about the fight of the gods in the twentieth of the iliads cited by longinus in his chapter of the loftiness of the conceptions            which in english is thus  jove flung his dreadful thunder from on high mean while majestic neptune from below the reeling globe with his huge trident struck shook its vast plains and made its mountains smoke mount ida trembled from his hoary top and from his nethermost foundations shook troubling a thousand springs that from him flow pluto from lowest hell both heard and felt and shivering started from his burning throne then striking his infernal breast cried out least wrathful neptune with another stroke of his dread trident should the globe divide should too to the gaping center let in light to mortals and immortals should display the dreadful secrets of his dire domain at the bare thought of which even gods are wont to shake behold here says longinus the earth laid open to the very center and hell about to be exposed to view and all the vast machine of the world demolished and overturned to show that in that important conflict both heaven and hell both mortal and immortal things every thing in nature engaged with the gods and nothing was free from danger  and now i mention longinus this is the properest place to show by his authority that religious ideas are the most proper to give greatness and sublimity to a discourse and this i shall show first by his examples and secondly by his precepts  first by his examples all the examples which he gives of sublimity in his chapter of the loftiness of the conceptions of which the above mentioned passage is one are taken from the grecian religion as this  iliad v    which in english is thus  as far as one who toward the ocean looks can from some lofty promontory spy through the vast deserts of a cloudless sky so far the immortal gods sonorous steeds can at one leap advance where says longinus he measures the length of their leap by the extent of the world who is it than says he that might not with reason cry out that if the horses of the gods would take a second leap they would not find space enough in the universe  and what follows concerning neptune descending from a mountain in thrace  iliad xiii   as from the shaggy mountain he descends the mountain trembles and the forest bends and a little beyond      in english thus  his golden chariot neptune now ascends and as he drives along the watery plain huge whales and all the monsters of the main wallowing around him with unweildy gate tempest the ocean to salute their king ocean rejoicing yawns before his march and lets him through a dreadful chasm and it was from this passage i make no doubt that spencer drew his admirable picture of neptune in the eleventh canto of the third book of his faery queen  stan xl next unto him was neptune pictured in his divine resemblance wondrous like his face was rugged and his hoary head dropped with brackish dew his three forkt pike he sternly shook and therewith fierce did strike the raging billows that on every side they trembling stoodand made a long broad dyke that his swift chariot might have passage wide which four great hippodames did draw in teem wise tied stan xli his sea horses did seem to snort amain and from their nostrils blow the briny stream that made the sparkling waves to smoke again and flame with gold but the white foamy cream did shine with silver and shoot forth her beam i now come to the precepts of longinus and pretend to show from them that the greatest sublimity is to be derived from religious ideas but why then says the reader has not longinus plainly told us so he was not ignorant that he ought to make his subject as plain as he could for he has told us in the beginning of his treatise that every one who gives instruction concerning an art ought to endeavor two things the first is to make his reader clearly understand what that is which he pretends to teach the second is to show him how it may be attained and he blames cecilius very severely for neglecting the last how then says the objector comes he himself to have taken no care of the first is it because cecilius had done it before him if so it was a very great fault in longinus to publish a book which could not be understood but by another mans writings especially when he saw that those writings were so very defective that they would not probably last but what continues the objector if cecilius had not done it before him for longinus tells us that cecilius makes use of a multitude of words to show what it is now he who knows any thing clearly may in a few words explain it clearly to others and he who does not will make it obscure by many  to this i answer that though longinus did by long study and habitude know the sublime when he saw it as well as any man yet he had not so clear a knowledge of the nature of it as to explain it clearly to others for if he had done that as the objector says he would have defined it but he has been so far from defining it that in one place he has given an account of it that is contrary to the true nature of it for he tells us in that chapter which treats of the fountains of sublimity that loftiness is often without any passion at all which is contrary to to the true nature of it the sublime is indeed often without common passion as ordinary passion is often without that but then it is never without enthusiastic passion for the sublime is nothing else but a great thought or great thoughts moving the soul from it is ordinary situation by the enthusiasm which naturally attends them now longinus had a notion of enthusiastic passion for he establishes it in that very chapter for the second source of sublimity now longinus by affirming that the sublime may be without not only that but ordinary passion says a thing that is not only contrary to the true nature of it but contradictory of himself for he tells us in the beginning of the treatise that the sublime does not so properly persuade us as it ravishes and transports us and produces in us a certain admiration mingled with astonishment and with surprise which is quite another thing than the barely pleasing or the barely persuading that it gives a noble vigor to a discourse an invincible force which commits a pleasing rape upon the very soul of the reader that whenever it breaks out where it ought to do like the artillery of jove it thunders blazes and strikes at once and shows all the united force of a writer now i leave the reader to judge whether longinius has not been saying here all along that sublimity is never without passion  that the forementioned disinition is just and good i have reason to believe because it takes in all the sources of sublimity which longinus has established for first greatness of thought supposes elevation they being synonimous terms and secondly the enthusiasm or the pathetique as longinus calls it follows of course for if a man is not strongly moved by great thoughts he does not sufficiently and effectually conceive them and thirdly the figurativelanguage is but a consequence of the enthusiasm that being the natural language of the passions and so is fourthly the nobleness of the expression supposing a man to be master of the language in which he writes for as the thoughts produce the spirit or the passion the spirit produces and makes the expression which is known by experience to all who are poets for never any one while he was rapt with enthusiasm or ordinary passion wanted either words or harmony and is self evident to all who consider that the expression conveys and shows the spirit and consequently must be produced by it  thus the definition which we have laid down being according to longinus his own doctrine the true definition of the sublime and showing clearly the thing which he has not done nor given any definition at all of it it seems plain to me that he had no clear and distinct idea of it and consequently religion might be the thing from which it is chiefly to be derived and he but obscurely know it but that religion is that thing from which the sublime is chiefly to be derived let us show by the marks which he has given of the latter which will further strengthen our definition first says he that which is truly sublime has this peculiar to it that it exalts the soul and makes it conceive a greater idea of it self filling it with joy and with a certain noble pride as if it self had produced what it but barely reads  now here it is plain that the highest ideas must most exalt the soul but religious ideas are the highest  the more the soul is moved by the greatest ideas the more it conceives them but the more it conceives of the greatest ideas the greater opinion it must have of its own capacity by consequence the more it is moved by the wonders of religion the more it values it self upon its own excellences again the more the soul sees its excellence the more it rejoices besides religious ideas are the most admirable and what is most admirable according to the doctrine of aristrotle is most delightful besides religious ideas create passion in such a manner as to turn and incline the soul to its primitive object so that reason and passion are of the same side and this peace between the faculties causes the soul to rejoice of which we shall have occasion to say more anon    the second mark that longinus gives of the sublime is when a discourse leaves a great deal for us to think but now this is certain that the wonders of religion are never to be exhausted for they are always new and the more you enter into them the more they are sure to surprise    the third mark is when it leaves in the reader an idea above its expression now no expressions can come up to the ideas which we draw from the atributes of god or from his wondrous works which only the author of them can comprehend    the fourth mark is when it makes an impression upon us which it is impossible to resist  god who made man for himself and for his own glory and who requires chiefly his heart must by consequence have formed him of such a nature as to be most strongly moved with religious ideas if once he enters into them so that the impressions which they make are impossible to be resisted    the fifth mark is when the impression lasts and is difficult to be defaced now that the impressions which religion makes upon us are difficult to be defaced is plain from this that they who think it their interest to deface them can never bring it about    the sixth mark is when it pleases universally people of different humors inclinations sexes ages times climates now there is nothing so agreeable to the soul or that makes so universal an impression as the wonders of religion some persons are moved by love and are not touched by ambition others are animated by ambition and only laugh at love some are pleased with a brave revenge others with a generous contempt of injuries but the eternal power and the infinite knowledge of god the wonders of the creation and the beautiful brightness of virtue make a powerful impression on all  i must confess i have wondered very much upon reflection how it could happen that so great a man as longinus who whenever he met a passage in any discourse that was lofty enough to please him had discernment enough to see that it had some of the preceding marks should miss of finding so easy a thing as this that never any passage had all these marks or so much as the majority of them unless it were religious  but to return to terror we may plainly see by the foregoing precepts and examples of longinus that this enthusiastic terror contributes extremely to the sublime and secondly that it is most produced by religious ideas  first ideas producing terror contribute extremely to the sublime all the examples that longinus brings of the loftiness of the thought consist of terrible ideas and they are principally such ideas that work the effects which he takes notice of in the beginning of his treatise viz that ravish and transport the reader and produce a certain admiration mingled with astonishment and with surprise for the ideas which produce terror are necessarily accompanied with admiration because every thing that is terrible is great to him to whom it is terrible and with surprise without which terror cannot subsist and with astonishment because every thing which is very terrible is wonderful and astonishing and as terror is perhaps the violentst of all the passions it consequently makes an impression which we cannot resist and which is hardly to be defaced and no passion is attended with greater joy than enthusiastic terror which proceeds from our reflecting that we are out of danger at the very time that we see it before us and as terror is one of the violentest lentest of all passions if it is very great and the hardest to be resisted nothing gives more force nor more vehemence to a discourse but secondly it is plain from the same longinus that this enthusiastic terror is chiefly to be derived from religious ideas for all the examples which he has brought of the sublime in his chapter of the sublimity of the thoughts consists of most terrible and most religious ideas and at the same time every mans reason will inform him that every thing that is terrible in religion is the most terrible thing in the world  but that we may set this in a clearer light let us lay before the reader the several ideas which are capable of producing this enthusiastic terror which seem to me to be those which follow viz gods demons hell spirits and souls of men miracles prodigies enchantments witchcrafts thunder tempests raging seas inundations torrents earthquakes volcanos monsters serpents lions tygres fire war pestilence famine etc  now of all these ideas none are so terrible as those which show the wrath and vengeance of an angry god for nothing is so wonderful in its effects and consequently the images or ideas of those effects must carry a great deal of terror with them which we may see was longinus his opinion by the examples which he brings in his chapter of the sublimity of the thoughts now of things which are terrible those are the most terrible which are the most wonderful because that seeing them both threatening and powerful and not being able to fathom the greatness and extent of their power we know not how far and how soon they may hurt us  but further nothing is so terrible as the wrath of infinite power because nothing is so unavoidable as the vengeance designed by it there is no flying nor lying hid from the great universal monarch he may deliver us from all other terrors but nothing can save and defend us from him and therefore reason which serves to dissipate our terrors in some other dangers serves but to augment them when we are threatened by infinite power and that fortitude which may be heroic at other times is down right madness then  for the other ideas which we mentioned above they will be found to be more terrible as they have more of religion in them but we shall have so many necessary occasions of giving examples of them in the sequel of this treatise that it will be altogether needless to do it now but here it will be convenient to answer an objection for how come some of the forementioned ideas which seem to have but little to do with religion to be terrible to great and to wise men as it is plain that such when they read the descriptions of them in homer and virgil are terrified  to which we answer that the care which nature has inrooted in all of their own preservation is the cause that men are unavoidably terrified with any thing that threatens approaching evil it is now our business to show how the ideas of serpents lions tigers etc were made by the art of those great poets to be terrible to their readers at the same time that we are secure from their objects  it is very plain that it is the apprehension of danger which causes that emotion in us which we call terror and it signifies nothing at all to the purpose whether the danger is real or imaginary and it is as plain too that the soul never takes the alarm from any thing so soon as it does from the senses especially those two noble ones of the eye and the ear by reason of the strict assinity which they have with the imagination and the evil always seems to be very near when those two senses give notice of it and the nearer the evil is the greater still is the terror but now let us see how those two poets did by virtue of their ideas bring even absent terrible objects within the reach of those two noble senses first then to bring an absent terrible object before our sight they drew an image or picture of it but to draw an image or picture of a terrible object so as to surprise and astonish the soul by the eye they never failed to draw it in violent action or motion and in order to that they made choice of words and numbers which might best express the violence of that action or motion for an absent object can never be set before the eye in a true light unless it is shown in violent action or motion because unless it is shown so the soul has leisure to reflect upon the deceit but violent motion can never be conceived without a violent agitation of spirit and that sudden agitation surptises the soul and gives it less time to reflect and at the same time causes the impressions that the objects make to be so deep and their traces to be so profound that it makes them in a manner as present to us as if they were really before us for the spirits being set in a violent emotion and the imagination being fired by that agitation and the brain being deeply penetrated by those impressions the very objects themselves are set as it were before us and consequently we are sensible of the same passion that we should feel from the things themselves for the warmer the imagination is the less able we are to reflect and consequently the things are the more present to us of which we draw the images and therefore when the imagination is so inflamed as to render the soul utterly incapable of reflecting there is no difference between the images and the things themselves as we may see for example by men in raging feavours but those two great poets were not satisfied with setting absent objects before our eyes by showing them in violent motion but if their motion occasioned any extraordinary sounds that were terrifying they so contrived their numbers and expressions as that they might be sure to ring those sounds in the very ears of their readers  we ought now to treat of the other enthusiastic passions as horror grief joy and desire but to the end that we may diversifie this treatise as much as we can and not tire out the reader with too much speculation at a time we shall omit speaking of them till we come to the epick poets  chap v recapitulation and that religion is the basis and foundation of the greater poetry but now let us recapitulate we have shown in the foregoing part of this discourse that passion is the characteristical mark of poetry and that all poetry is pathetick and then we divided it into two kinds the greater and the less and showed that the greater poetry comprehends epick tragic and the greater lyrick and that our design was in the first place to treat of that then we proceeded to show that as passion is the characteristical mark of poetry great passion must be the characteristical mark of the greater poetry and consequently that this last must have every where great passion but that since what we commonly call passion cannot be every where there must be something distinct from ordinary passion and that must be enthusiasm then we endeavored to discover what enthusiasm is and how many several sorts there are of it and that admiration and terror make the principal greatness of poetry and are the chief of the enthusiastic passions that those two passions are to bear proportion with the ideas from which they are derived and that consequently the greatest must flow from religious ideas we shall show too in the sequel of this discourse that not only the remaining enthusiastic passions horror sadness joy and desire but that even the ordinary passions which contribute most to the greatness of poetry as admiration terror and pity are chiefly to be derived from religion but that the passions of both sorts must for the most part flow greater from revelation than from natural religion because all revealed religion whether true or pretended speaks to the senses brings the wonders of another world more home to us and so makes the passions which it raises the greater  the fundamental rule then that we pretend to lay down for the succeeding or excelling in the greater poetry is that the constitution of the poem be religious that it may be throughout pathetick  and we pretend to prove undeniably that not only the gentlemen whose works we design to examine have succeeded and excelled no further than their poems have been so constituted but that never any poets of any nation or any age ever did or can excel without it i have already proved in the advancement of modern poetry beyond all manner of doubt to those who have capacity enough to comprehend the arguments that the ancient poets excelled the moderns in the greatness of poetry for no other reason but because their subjects were religious in their constitution and therefore all that i shall say of it here is that poetry is the natural language of religion and that religion at first produced it as a cause produces its effect in the first ages of writing among the graecians there was nothing writ but verse because they wrote of nothing but religion which was necessary for the cementing the societies which in those times were but just united and nature had taught them that poetry was the only language in which they could worthily treat of the most important parts of religion or worthily perform its most important duties but as soon as religion was sufficiently imprinted in the minds of men and they had jeisure to treat of human things in their writings they invented prose and invented it in imitation of verse as strabo tells us in the first book of his geography but after that prose was invented by them never any of them treated of their gods or their religious matters in prose before the age of socrates because they found that that way of writing was by no means proper for it for the wonders of religion naturally threw them upon great passions and great passions naturally threw them upon harmony and figurative language as they most of necessity do any poet as long as he continues master of them which is known by experience to all who are poets for never any one while he was rapt with enthusiasm or with ordinary passion wanted either words or harmony and therefore poetry is more harmonious than prose because it is more pathetick even in prose your orators and all who pretend to move the passions have more harmonious periods than they who barely speak to the reason and in poetry they who write with a great deal of passion are generally very harmonious whereas those who write with but little are not so musical horace is an illustrious example of this no man who has read his odes can doubt of the fineness and the delicacy of his ear and therefore his satyrs are often harsh and rugged because the spirit in them is mean and little no man can believe that juvenal had a finer ear than horace but yet his satyrs are more musical because they have a greater spirit in them at the same time it is a little odd to consider that passion which disturbs the soul should occasion it to produce harmony which seems to emply the order and composure of it whether this proceeds from the secret effort that the soul makes to compose it self or whatever the cause is the effect is certain but as passion which is the disorder of the soul produces harmony which is agreement so harmony which is concord augments and propagates passion which is discord all who are acquainted with poetry or music must be as sensible of this as mr waller was fully convinced of it well sounding verses are the charm we use heroic thoughts and virtue to infuse things of deep sense we may in prose unfold but they move more in lofty numbers told by the loud trumpet which our courage aids we learn that sound as well as sense persuades   thus we may see by mr waller that numbers are proper to move passion and for that reason are inseparable from poetry which has no other design but we shall have occasion to treat of harmony more at large when we come to the particular sorts of poems in the mean time let us return to the business from which we may seem to have digressd  as we have formerly undeniably proved in the advancement of modern poetry that the ancient poets derived that advantage which they have over the moderns to the constituting their subjects after a religious manner so i shall make it appear in the sequel of this discourse that it was owing to the same thing that the ancient poets very often excelled themselves  and i have reason to believe that one of the principal reasons that has made the modern poetry so contemptible is that by divesting it self of religion it is fallen from its dignity and its original nature and excellence and from the greatest production of the mind of man is dwindled to an extravagant and a vain amusement for the modern poetry being for the most part profane has either very little spirit or if it has a great one that spirit is out of nature because it bears no manner of proportion to the ideas from which it is forcibly denvd nor the ideas very often to the objects from which they are taken for as mr waller says in boundless verse the fancy soars too high for any object but the deity what mortal can with heaven pretend to share in the superlatives of wise and fair a meaner object when with these we grace a giant habit on a dwarf we place   but that the modern poetry as miserably as it is fallen from the dignity of its original nature might gloriously arise and lift up its head surpassing even that of the ancients if the poets would but constitute their subjects religious i have formerly clearly shown in the second part of the advancement of modern poetry by showing that the design of the christian religion is the very same with that of poetry which can be said of no other religion that the business of both is to delight and reform mankind by exciting the passions in such a manner as to reconcile them to reason and restore the harmony of the humane faculties and therefore that i may repeat nothing at present that i have formerly said there i shall only add that if it is religion that gives the warmth and the passion to poetry it follows that the less mixture that religion has of any thing profane and humane in it the greater warmth and passion it must give to poetry for that which moves us in effect in a false religion must be the imagination of that which is true as for example in the above mentioned passage of the wrath of neptune the anger of neptune is fiction and so is the stroke of his trident but that which moves us at the bottom of this fiction is true which is that the anger of a deity and the effects of it are very terrible the reason why religion moves the soul so extremely is because the soul was created by god to find its happiness in him and all happiness consists in pleasure and all pleasure in passion now the less mixture religion has of any thing of human invention in it the more divine it is and the nearer it brings us to god  but that this may still appear the more clearly we shall endeavor to prove it by two very signal examples and shall produce two passages from scripture the one from the psalms and the other from habbakuk which we shall set against the two forementioned passages which longinus cited from homer the one of the wrath and the other of the power of neptune and his awful march through his own element and in setting these passages against one another we make no doubt to show that not only the subjects are exactly the same but that the advantage is clearly ours  let us begin with that passage concerning the might of neptune and his driving his chariot through the sea  as from the shaggy mountain he descends the mountain trembles and the forest bends and anon  his golden chariot neptune now ascends and as he drives along the watery plain huge whales and all the monsters of the main tempest the ocean to salute their king ocean rejoicing yawns before his march and lets him through a dreadful chasm  now to this passage let us oppose that of the prophet habbakuk exactly upon the same occasion only the prophet says of the true god what homer says of neptune  when the almighty from mount paran came the brightness of his glory with its blaze expanding filled the vast abyss of heaven and the whole earth resounded with his praise the burning pestilence before him marched and from his feet a fiery whirlwind flew he stood and measured the extended earth scattering the trembling nations with a look at which the everlasting mountains fled and shaking the perpetual hills did bow against the floods was thy fierce anger then against the sea the burning of thy wrath that thou did through it with thy flaming steeds and with thy chariots of salvation drive the rocks their sommets beetled over their base to view the terrors of thy wondrous march then shivering shrunk from the amazing sigh the floods dividing showed a fearful chasm and asthy sounding horses all on fire tro heaps of congregated waters flew the deep his roaring voice at all his mouths uttered and lifted all his arms on high but now let us come to the wrath of neptune and the effects of it in the battle of the twentieth of the iliads in which the gods were engaged  jove flung his dreadful thunder from on high mean while majestic neptune from below the reeling globe with his huge trident struck shook its vast plains and made its mountains smoke mount ida trembled from his hoary top and from his nethermost foundations shook troubling a thousand springs that from him flow pluto from lowest hell both heard and felt and shivering started from his burning throne then striking his infernal breast cried out least wrathful neptune with another stroke of his dread trident should the globe divide should to the gaping center let in light to mortals and immortals should display the dreadful secrets of his dire domain at the bare thought of which even gods are wont to shake as the necessity of the subject has obliged us to repeat these verses so we have the same excuse for the repeating the reflection of longinus behold here says longinus the earth laid open to the very center and hell about to be exposed to view and all the vast machine of the world demolished and overturned to show that in that important conflict both heaven and hell both mortal and immortal things every thing in nature engaged with the gods and nothing was free from danger now let us see the psalmist introducing the true god actually demolishing and overturning the machine of the world only with a word and with a look  in my distress i called upon the lord and to my god i cried he from his height above all heights strait heard my mournful voice and to my loud complaint inclined his ear strait the earth trembled and her entrails shook as conscious of her great creators wrath the mountains from their fixed foundations ran and frighted from their inmost caverns roared from out his nostrils a tempestuous cloud of pitchy smoke in spicy volumes flew and from his mouth there ran a raging flood of torrent fire devouring as it ran and then he bowed the very heaven of heavens and armed with fearful majesty came down under his feet he placed substantial night which awed the nations with its dreadful gloom upon the flaming cherubim he rode and on the wings of all the winds he flew still darkness ushered his mysterious way and a black night of congregated clouds became the dark pavillion of his throne the clouds his brightness could no longer bear but vanishing revered the sacred sourse of light and as the congregated clouds dispersed a storm of monstrous hail came pouring down down the red lightning winged its slanting way but when his wrathful voice was heard on high strait both the poles rebellowd to the sound in thicker sheets the rattling hail came down down came the lightning with repeated flames and thunder bellowing through the boundless space astonished nature with redoubled roars earth could no longer bear the mortal fright but shook it self from its perpetual hinge at thy rebuke o lord and at the blast the dreadful blast of thy revenging breath then upwards from the gaping center cleavd with a prodigious wound the fixed foundations of the world displayed displayed the ghastful caverns of the deep a sight that blasted even the worlds great eye and made the starting sun recoil from his eternal way but here it will be necessary to answer an objection for it may be urged perhaps that common experience will destroy these new speculations for several of the moderns have attempted divine poetry and yet some of them have been contemptible to the last degree and not one of them has excelled the ancients  to which we answer that milton has clearly the advantage of the ancients in several points as shall be shown in its proper place and if the rest of the moderns who have attempted sacred poetry have fallen so very much short of them it has been either for want of genius or for want of art to know how to make use of religion for sacred poetry apparently requires a greater capacity than the profane does because the greater the ideas are the greater must the capacity be that receives them but sacred ideas are greater then the profane as has been shown above and therefore if the rule of horace be true that a poet ought to proportion his subject to his strength it follows that a man may succeed pretty well in human poetry and yet be despicable in the divine besides as religion supplies us with greater ideas than any thing human can do so it requires greater enthusiasm and a greater spirit to attend them as has been shown above too so that sacred poetry requires not only a very great capacity but a very warm and strong imagination which is a happy mixture that is to be met with in a very few and even of those few not one in a thousand perhaps applies himself to sacred poetry and even of those rare ones who have applied themselves hardly one of the moderns has known the true use that ought to be made of religion in poetry milton indeed happened upon it in his paridise lost i say happened upon it because he has erred very widely from it in his paradise regained as shall be shown in its proper place the rules for employing religion in poetry are principally these which follow    the first is that the religion ought to be one that the poet may be moved by it and that he may appear to be in earnest and the not observing of this rule was one reason why spencer miscarried as we shall show anon    the second rule that the religion which the poet employs ought to be the reigning one that both the poet and the readers may be moved the more by a religion in which they were bred and this rule may acquaint us with one of the reasons why all who have translated homer and virgil have succeeded so very indifferently    the third is that it may run through and be incorporated with the action of the poem and consequently that it may always be a part of action and productive of action for from the neglect of this third rule strange inequalities would follow in a poem as shall be shown more at large when we treat of spencer and cowley    the fourth rule is that the religion may be managed so as to promote the violence of the enthusiastic passions and their change and variety and the constituting his subject contrary to this rule was one great reason why milton did not succeed in his paradise regained    that it may not hinder the violence of the ordinary passions nor the change and variety of them and the not constituting his subject according to this rule is the chief reason why homer in his odysses fell so far short of his iliads and milton of his paradise lost in his paradise regained    that the religion be managed so as not to obstruct the violence of action which is always attended by the violence of ordinary passion and the not observing of this was one great reason of the miscarriage of homer and milton in the forementioned poems    that the divine and humane persons if there be any may have inclinations and affections which tassos celestial persons have not nor as i remember cowleys    that they be fairly distinguished from one another by those inclinations and affections and this is the great advantage that the grecian machines have for the most part over those in our religion yet milton has pretty well distinguished his celestial persons from one another and his infernal ones admirably    that they be fairly distinguished from the human persons by the same inclinations and affections and here milton in his infernal persons has undeniably the advantage both of ancients and moderns the passions and inclinations of the grecian gods are downright human inclinations and affections the passions of miltonss devils have enough of humanity in them to make them delightful but then they have a great deal more to make them admirable and may be said to be the true passions of devils but the time to speak more largely of this will be when we come to the epick poets  but now as we have shown that the religion revealed in the old and new testament is proper nay necessary to give the last force and elevation to poetry we shall now endeavor to convince the reader that poetry is proper if not necessary to give force to that religion for indeed there are duties in this religion which cannot be worthily performed without the a ssistance of poetry as the offering up praise and thanksgiving and several sorts of prayer to god and the celebrating the wonders of his might because if the ideas which these subjects afford are expressed with passion equal to their greatness that which expresses them is poetry for that which makes poetry to be what it is is only because it has more passion than any other way of writing  it is ridiculous to imagine that there can be a more proper way to express some parts and duties of a religion which we believe to be divinely inspired than the very way in which they were at first delivered now the most important part of the old testament was delivered not only in a poetical style but in poetical numbers the most important parts of the old testament to us are the prophesies because without them we could never be satisfied that jesus is the messiah for the prophets were poets by the institution of their order and poetry was one of the prophetic functions which were chiefly three   predicting or foretelling things to come   declaring the will of god to the people and   praising god with songs of the prophets composing accompanied with the harp and other instrumental music from whence it came to pass that praising god upon such kind of instruments is often in the scriptures called prophesying as mr mede has observed in his diatribae and has proved it from several passages of the old testament and more particularly from the   first verses of the   th chapter of the chronicles which are as follows  v  moreover david and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of asaph and of heman and of jeduthun such as should prophecy with harps with psalteries and with cymbals and the number of the workmen according to their service was  v   of the sons of asaph zaccar and joseph and nethaniah and asarelah the sons of asaph under the hands of asaph which prophesied according to the order of the king  v  of jeduthun the sons of jeduthun gedaliah and zeri and jeshaiah hashabiah and metithiah six under the hands of their father jeduthun who prophesied with a harp to give thanks and to praise the lord  nor was their poetical talent confined to their praise and thanksgiving but is to be seen in their predictions too as we said before and in their declaring the will of god to the people  as the prophets were poets by their institution so when the son of god himself came down from heaven in order to reform the earth he who was a prophet as well as a priest and a king did by consequence discharge the three prophetical functions of which the poetical has been shown to be one and consequently though our savior did not make use of a style that was figurative and enthusiastic because he instructed the world as god and as god he could not feel either admiration or terror or the rest of the enthusiastic passions yet we find that he not only praised god with spiritual songs but that the method of his instruction was entirely poetical that is by fables or parables contrived and placed and adapted to work very strongly upon human passions  thus the prophets among the jews were poets and the divine institutor of the christian religion being a prophet by a poetical method instructed and reformed the world and even the grecian poets pretending to discharge the three prophetical functions were not only vulgarly reputed prophets but were ftyld so by st paul himself who quoting a verse out of epimenides in the epistle which he wrote to titus calls that cretensian poet a prophet as one of their own prophets has said  thus we have made it very plain that not only the predictions but the praise and thanksgiving in the inspired writers were written in verse as were likewise several of the prayers and the instructions and in short the noblest and mostimportant part of the old testament now if they were written in poetry it could be for no other reason but because they who wrote them believed that the figurative passionate style and the poetical numbers did by right of nature belong to them and consequently were requisite to enforce them upon the minds of men and here we cannot as it were help observing that for the scriptures to make all the impression that they are capable of making upon men of very good parts and perhaps too upon others all those parts of them that were written in verse ought to be translated in verse and by persons who are the most qualified to do it with force and harmony for if the passion and harmony were thought requisite by the original writers who were divinely inspired to give force to the hebrew why should not spirit and passion and numbers in a translation give a proportionable force to that for if harmony of it self is of force to lift up our thoughts to heaven as our clergy seem to emply by the use of it in our churches and may be gathered from what happened to elisha in the second of kings when they would have had him prophecy at a time when the spirit of prophecy chapter   v    was not upon him where the prophet says now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass as the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him  if harmony i say is of it self so efficacious what must it not be when incorporated with a religigious sense and a poetical style there can certainly be no better way to reform the world than the reading of those writings which we believe to be divinely inspired but this is as certain that the greater the pleasure is with which we read them we shall the more frequently discharge that duty but to make us read them with more pleasure than we do they must have more of the agreableness of their originals that is more perspicuity more force and more harmony this would more particularly attract the gentry and particularly those of the most extraordinary parts among them whose examples would influence the rest as the rest would influence the people for they of extraordinary parts for the most part being extremely delighted with poetry and finding the greatest and most exalted poetry upon religious subjects would by degrees become more used to be moved by sacred ideas than they would by profane that is would by degrees become reformed that this is by no means a chimera experience may serve to convince us for i know several gentlemen of very good sense who are extremely moved by miltons hymn in the fifth book of paradise lost and hardly at all stirred with the translation of the     psalm from whence that hymn is taken but if men of very good parts are more moved by the hymn it follows that they ought to be more moved by it because men of very good sense are only moved to that degree by things by which they ought to be moved so that we may conclude that the passion or enthusiasm in that hymn is exactly in nature that is that the enthusiasm or passion or spirit call it what you will flows from the ideas and bears a just proportion to them  but from hence at the same time it follows that since those persons who are so much moved by the hymn are not equally stirred by the translated psalm the passion or spirit is less in the latter and does not come up to the ideas and therefore we may conclude that milton by his genius and harmony has restored that spirit in composing the hymn which had been lost by the weakness of the translation and the want of poetical numbers which last as we have said before contribute very much to the raising of passion  what milton has done in relation to the     psalm others may do in a less proportion to other parts of the old testament till the favor of the prince and public encouragement causes another milton to arise and apply himself to so necessary and so noble a work for this is certain that there are not wanting great geniuss to every age but they do not equally appear in every age sometimes for want of knowing themselves and sometimes for want of encouragement and leisure to exert themselves the business of the following treatise is to show them how they may try and know and form themselves which is all that i am capable of attempting toward the restoring so useful and so noble an art if i were in a condition to give them encouragement too they should not be long without it if they who so much exceed me in power did but equal me in will we should soon see poetry raise up its dejected head and our own might come to emulate the happiest of grecian and roman ages  and thus much may suffice to show the nature of poetry but chiefly of the greater poetry and the importance of this design for since poetry has been thought not only by heathens but by the writers of the old testament and consequently by god himself who inspired them to be the fittest method for the enforcing religion upon the minds of men and since religion is the only solid foundation of all civil society it follows that whoever endeavors to reestablish poetry makes a generous attempt to restore an art that may be highly advantageous to the public and beneficial to mankind  finis
