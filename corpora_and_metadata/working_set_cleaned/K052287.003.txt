the fool of quality or the history of henry earl of moreland  vol iii  by mr brook  dublin printed for the author by dillon chamberlain in dame street facing fowness street mdcclxviii  the fool of quality or the history of henry earl of moreland chap xiii story of the hon mr clinton the world my lovely cousin the world is to man as his temper or complexion the mind constitutes its own prosperity and adversity winter presents no cloud to a cheerful spirit neither can summer find sunshine for the spirit that is in a state of dejection in my youth every object presented me with happiness but alas the time came when the universe appeared as a vault wherein joy was entombed and the sun himself but as a lamp that served to show the gloom and the horrors around me  as my father and mother died before i was taken from nurse i knew none of those parental tendernesses and endearments that serve to humanize the soul and give it the first impressions of social attachment neither were those sweetnesses in any degree supplied to me by the behavior of an imperious brother or of a magisterial guardian as i was naturally however of a benevolent cast i sought for those affections and amities among strangers which i had not found in the bosoms or faces of kin  i pass over the immaterial parts of my life at school and college and hasten to the more important period of my apprenticeship  your father bound me to mr golding a very wealthy and eminent merchant who lived over against the exchange he had been some years a widower and his only child a daughter was then at the boardingschool  mr golding with a plain understanding was a man of exceeding honesty and a susceptible heart at first sight he conceived a partial affection for me whereof he gave me very frequent and very tender proofs and as he stood to me in the place of a patron and a father i felt for him all the fondness and attachment of a child  in the fourth year of my apprenticeship he called me to his closet and taking me kindly by the hand harry says he i love you your interest lies near my heart for though you are not the begotten of my body you are the child of my affections  be quiet harry  let me speak  i have to talk to you of matters of consequence  i went yesterday to your uncle goodall to know how accounts stood between ye  though he is but a cold kinsman he is a very faithful guardian  he has just married a very lovely young woman and i would have you go and pay your compliments to them on the occasion  your uncle has laid out your little penny to good advantage and your   000 l is now nearly doubled  and now harry as your father did not behave like a father toward you in the dividend which he made between you and your brother i propose in some measure to supply his place and i make you a present of this note of   000 l which added to your little patrimony may enable you  o sir i cried  be quiet child i say again till you find whether or no you shall have reason to thank me  i am growing old my harry and by a long course of industry have earned a kind of title to some little rest i would therefore gladly make a composition between your application and my repose i shall not be so often in the counting house as usual i propose to take you into immediate partnership but as i also propose that you shall be at three fourths of the trouble it is but just that i should offer you a proportionable advantage  now as my capital harry is more than five times as much as yours of   000 l i offer to your acceptance a full moiety of all the profits in recompense of your extraordinary attention and application  hear me out  i do not think that i shall lose by this bargain the affairs of potiphar prospered under the hands of young joseph and i believe that you also are a favorite of your god  i could not speak the good man perceived my oppression and catching me in his arms and pressing me to his bosom he shed a silent tear of satisfaction upon me and withdrew without saying another word  for several days following mr golding was employed in advising his correspondents that i was now become his partner and equal in trade and i was wearied with congratulations on my being one of the principal merchants in london before i had attained my twentieth year  the obligations and advantages which this good man thus delighted to heap upon me incited me to double application and sagacity and all the eyes of argus were opened within me for superintending and guarding the interests of my patron  i have often thought it somewhat romantic that i should win both my wives by a matter of adventure so that their partiality in my favor ought perhaps to be ascribed to a sentiment of gratitude rather than to any liking which they might take to my person  on a day in summer i rode to barnet to settle accounts with mr fradgil a correspondent of my masters who was said to be indisposed at his country seat as i approached the town i observed an elderly gentlewoman walking leisurely toward me attended by an orderly train of young maidens i observed at the same time two men in glistering apparel who hastily followed and coming quickly up put all the females to a stand and caused them to gather in a group as for mutual defense one of the men however no way daunted by the opposition of so numerous a company rudely caught one of the elder misses in his arms and repeatedly kissing her thrust his hand into her bosom mean while the young lady shrieked and cried aloud for help when riding suddenly up i struck the ruffian to the ground with the heavy end of my whip his companion hereupon drew his sword and turned upon me but pushing my horse at him i cast him also to the earth then alighting i broke their swords and leaving my gallants in a plight not suddenly to be dreaded i led my horse by the bridle till i saw my fair wards all safe to their dwelling  some months after this incident mr golding called me aside harry says he my daughter is now drawing to womans estate and should learn something more substantial than needle work and dancing and harpsichords and frenchified phrases i therefore propose to take her home where by the help of our cook and housekeeper she may be taught how to make a sundays pudding and to superintend a family  i regularly go to see her once in every month accompanied by some male or female acquaintance but never called you to be of the party as we could not so conveniently be both from home  my child though a plain girl is very dutiful and goodnatured her fortune as you are sensible will entitle her to the first lord of the land yet i know not how it is i would rather that my girl should be happy than great i do not wish to have her a fine titled dame i would rather i say see her married to some honest and tenderhearted man whose love might induce him to domesticate with her and to live peaceably and pleasingly within his familycircle than to see her mated with a prince of the blood  now harry as this affair of all affairs sits nearest at my heart it is greatly in your power to oblige me beyond expression on my daughters coming home i conclude we shall be beset by a number of courtiers such an argo when freighted with such a fleece will unquestionably be held in chase by many a pirate wherefore my son i would have you keep a sharp and inquisitive eye about you and to take good note of the manners and dispositions of such suitors as my daughter shall appear to regard as also to enquire minutely into their circumstances and characters your vigilance and penetration may save us from ruin should my child be made unhappy your friend must be most miserable but i depend my dear harry that while i live you will prove a kind brother to her and that you will prove a father to her in case of my mortality here the good man no longer able to restrain his passion put his handkerchief to his eyes and quitted the chamber  within a few days mr golding set out accompanied by a number of his cityfriends in order to conduct his daughter home on their arrival i was deeply engaged in the counting house and it was near the time for supper before i could attend as i entered mr golding presented me to his daughter saying this my dear is mr clinton my partner my friend my son and your brother hereupon miss golding colored and drawing back as i approached to salute her if i am not mistaken sir says she he is something more to us than all you have mentioned it would ill become me to forget that he is the deliverer of your daughter  your deliverer my dear matty how where when  why pray papa did mr clinton never tell you of his adventure at barnet  no indeed my dear  it is not every one who would be silent papa where so much was to be said to their own honor i remember that your knights in romance when too modest to boast of their own achievements used to permit some friend or squire to deliver down to posterity the history of their adventures and i take the liberty to be squire to mr clinton on the like occasion  here miss golding began to give a narrative of the matter already recited but in terms of high phrase and aggravated encomium while all abashed and confused i withdrew saying that i did not remember of any knights who staid to hear their own story  in truth i was much surprised to hear miss golding mention the adventure of barnet for i did not recollect that i had ever seen her and had taken much more note of two or three other misses than i had of her  being resummoned to supper mr golding met me as i entered and clasping me in his arms o my harry he cried how wonderfully gracious has god been to me in sending my best friend to the rescue of my only child in sending at so critical and very fearful a conjuncture perhaps the only person who had either gallantry or humanity enough to preserve her indeed sir i replied you owe me nothing i did not even know that the lady was your daughter and i could not pride myself in any degree on an action which i thought incumbent on every man to perform  during supper miss golding was very cheerful and agreeable her face indeed could not be numbered among the beauties but her person was grace and majesty though in miniature her conversation was pleasing and when she sung or touched her instruments for she was mistress of several her mien and motions were music each note seemed a sentiment and we felt her fingers playing on the chordage of our heart  for the first three months after miss goldings arrival all was crowding and gaiety assembly and festival at our house she was as a magnet that drew and grouped all the peerage and gentry of england together but as business happened to be very throng at that season i was not at liberty to partake of their amusements and i resigned to mr golding the commission which he had given me respecting the parties who declared themselves suitors  as those suitors in a daily and numerous succession applied to mr golding for his consent his general answer was that his goodliking was inseparable from that of his only child that he would if they pleased consult her on the occasion and faithfully report to them her approbation or dissent in the like conclusive manner when mr golding repeatedly questioned his daughter she would take his hand between here is and kissing it say o no my dear papa this is not the man  one day as i sat alone in the countingroom miss golding entered and presented me with an order from her father for l  0 and pray madam said i why this ceremony this matter of form sure miss golding may at any time command twenty times this sum without any order save her own intimation  indeed are you serious mr clinton i am very proud i assure you to have so much credit with you  but mr harry how comes it to pass that we have so little of your company  your fathers business madam deprives me of the pleasure i should otherwise have in attending you  again sir i am quite proud that it is your attention to my father alone which prevents your having any attention for his daughter  so saying she vanished  immediately i was struck with a glimpse of some uncommon meaning in the words and behavior of miss golding but as i never had looked toward the way of her affections i passed it lightly over as some matter of whim or caprice in the sex  among the brilliant concourse of suitors that frequented our house there was one mr spelling a young gentleman highly accomplished in his person and manners and of a most amiable countenance and disposition his father like miss goldings had been a merchant and like him too had amassed an excessive fortune as he was modest as i may say to a degree of shamefacedness he did not declare himself a lover till nearly the whole multitude of competitors had been discarded then with a blushing diffidence he avowed his passion to mr golding and earnestly besought his consent and intercession in his favor you have not only my consent replied the good old man you have also my best wishes and shall have my best endeavors for your success however i must warn you at the same time mr spelling that i will not do any violence to the inclinations of my child although there are not two in the world whom i would prefer to you  i was writing in my closet when mr golding came in with an anxious importance in his countenance and told me what passed between him and mr spelling and asked if i did not approve the match i do not know sir said i that man in england who is so deserving of your daughter as mr spelling then my dear harry i have a commission to give you matilda has a great respect for your judgment i beseech you to make use of your influence with her and to exert all your oratory in behalf of this young man  but sir will not miss matilda look on this as a matter of high presumption in one who has no manner of right to advise  no matter you may tell her that you did it by my desire and that we are both of a mind with regard to this business  well sir said i since you are bent upon it i will obey you but it is the first time that ever i obeyed you with reluctance  soon after mr golding left me his daughter entered with a countenance visibly inquiet and confused my papa sir said she informs me that you have a business of consequence to impart to me  i hope madam pray be seated a moment  indeed my dear miss golding this office was not of my choosing and i hope i say you will be so good as to pardon my presumption in consideration of my acting by your fathers command  you alarm me mr clinton pray proceed  mr spelling madam at length has had the assurance to declare his passion for you your father highly approves of mr spelling for a soninlaw and indeed miss might i dare to speak my judgment i know not where you could choose to better advantage  if that is the case mr harry i wish that i also could be of the same opinion  and are you not madam what objection can you form what exception can you have to my friend spelling  a very simple one sir and no better than this that he is not the man who can make me happy  i am sorry for it my dear miss golding i am truly sorry for it were i to pick from mankind were i to choose throughout the world if any one can deserve you it is surely this same spelling  and yet mr harry i remember to have seen the man who in every grace and merit is infinitely preferable to your favorite spelling  where when my dear miss  when i am brought to the torture i may possibly be under the necessity of confessing  pardon pardon sweet madam i meant no offense and yet i wish to heaven i knew  but that you never shall know mr harry  pray then madam if i may adventure on one question more has the party so highly favored any knowledge of his own happiness  i hope not mr harry but of what advantage could his knowledge prove to me i beseech you can you suppose that such a person as i have described could deign to look with favor on such a one as i am  i do not believe madam that the man is in england who would not think himself highly honored highly blessed by your hand but then are you assured miss that this man is worthy of it  ah there lies my misfortune he is too worthy too noble too accomplished too lovely too much every thing for my wishes to leave any thing to my hopes and now mr harry that i have entrusted you with my secret i hope you will not betray my confidence and reveal it to my papa i rather trust and request that you will use some other color for reconciling him to my refusal of mr spelling and to make you some amends for the mortification i have given you by rejecting your advocation in behalf of your friend i here engage never to marry without your approbation though i do not promise sir that you shall dictate to my choice there is one thing further mr clinton in which you may oblige me it is to prevail on my father to dismiss these assemblies and revels that pester our house indeed they never were to my taste though by their novelty at first they might have helped to amuse a little matter of melancholy that hung upon my mind but now they are grown quite insufferable to me  here her eye began to fill and heaving a gentle sigh she curtsied and withdrew  immediately my heart was softened and affected i saw the child of my friend and patron the one in whom his hopes and fortunes and very life were wrapped up i saw that she was unhappy that she was very unhappy at a time that she had forbidden me to attempt her relief though i would gladly have parted with half my fortune to have been enabled to give the object of her wishes to her arms  in the mean while my dearest madam it was the farthest of all things from entering into my imagination that i was the very person who sat so near her heart i daily saw the loveliest youths and titled chiefs of the land attendant on her words and smiles and humbly suing for her favor i saw also that her immense fortune and rare attractions justly entitled her to their homage and i was neither vain enough nor base enough to attempt a competition  as in myself i was wholly devoid of passion i had neither eyes nor apprehension for the discernment of hers though i had often seen i seldom had any kind of converse with her and where the head is engaged and in a manner absorbed by business there is neither leisure nor room for love to enter the heart on the other hand a person affected can instantly penetrate the bosom of the party beloved and there discern a vacant and insensible heart as legibly as a priest of isis could decypher hieroglyphics  one day as i happened to pass near her antichamber i heard the warble as i thought of distant and aetherial music i approached towered the sound the door was on the jar and gently opening it i entered and stood behind her unperceived she sat and sang to her lute the words were shakespeares but sweetly set by herself they expressed that passage in his play of twelfth night where it is said of viola she never told her love but let concealment like a worm in the bud feed on her damask cheek etc ah how affectingly did her instrument answer to her voice while she gently tuned her sighs to the soft and melancholy cadences my breast was so swelled by a mixture of anguish and compassion that i could no longer wholly suppress a rising groan hereat she started and turned and rising suddenly her eyes shot fire and her face glowed with indignation and resentment but observing the tears that still trickled down my cheeks her countenance was as suddenly changed into kindness and she cast upon me a look of inexpressible complacence  ah mr harry says she i see i see that you have a gentle and a kindred kind of heart and that if ever you happen to love you will love with great tenderness  have you ever loved mr harry  indeed madam i cannot say my commerce has been very little among the ladies if i met love on my way or even found it in my heart perhaps i should not rightly know what to make of it but my matilda my charming sister your father has honored me with the privilege of calling you by that dear that tender name why will you not entrust your best your truest friend with the secret of your disquiet whoever the object of your esteem may be i here solemnly engage at the risque of my life and the loss of my fortune to bring him voluntarily to pay his vows at your feet o my sister i would to heaven that he had now been present as i have been present to have his soul melted and minted as mine has been his heart must have been harder than the stones of thebes if you did not attract it and move it at pleasure by the touch of those fingers and the bewitchment of those accents  ah you flatterer she cried with a voice tuned to harmony and a face formed of smiles you almost tempt me to tell you what for the world i would not wish that any one in the world should know but i must snatch myself from the danger  so saying and casting at me a vanishing glance she was out of sight in a twinkling  as our suitors had now been dismissed and our assemblies discontinued miss golding seemed quite pleased with our familyabridgment it gave us frequent occasions of being together i endeavored by a variety of tender offices and little amusements to dispell or divert the melancholy under which i thought she labored i was greatly surprised at my own success on this occasion her cheerfulness returned she discovered new and striking graces in her manners and conversation and in a little time did not appear to want any consolation  one day being on the exchange i was accosted by a jew who told me that he wanted a sum of money and would either sell or pawn to me a jewel of great price it was a solitaire composed of oriental pearls with a diamond of the first water and magnitude in the center after some chaffering we agreed for three thousand pieces and i put it into my pocketbook as my business detained me on the exchange till it was late i dined with two or three acquaintance at the chophouse and did not return till the evening was advanced  on my entering i was told that mr golding was abroad and that miss matilda had just ordered coffee for some ladies in her dressing room immediately i ran up and opened the door without ceremony but was instantly struck with the look which she turned towered me a look that at once intimated dejection and disgust during coffee i endeavored to behave with my usual unconcern but found it impossible to avoid sharing in that constraint under which miss matilda most evidently labored in short a gloomy stiffness spread through the whole conversation and i believe no two persons in company were rightly satisfied with each other  as soon as the cups were removed the fair visitants got up and as miss golding pressed them to stay in a manner that rather denoted her desire of their absence they feigned a further engagement and very formally took their leaves  when she had seen them to the door and that i had handed them into their carriages she turned without speaking to me and withdrew toward her own apartment i followed and as she was about to enter my matilda my sister said i with a voice of cordial tenderness do your harry the favor to accept this trifle as an instance of my regard for the daughter of my friend for the dearest object upon earth of my esteem and affection so saying i presented her with my recent purchase she did not however even deign to look at it but surveying me from head to foot with an eye of strange passions she took it and dashed it against the floor and rushing into her chamber she shut to the door upon me without speaking a word  i stood in an inconceivable astonishment and concern in vain i searched and researched my memory for the recollection of some instance wherein i might have offended her but not presuming to obtrude upon her in order to question or expostulate with her i retreated to my apartment under the deepest dejection of spirits  mr golding did not return till it was late in the evening he immediately sent for me harry says he what is the matter has any thing happened amiss i never saw you look so discomposed indeed sir i am not as well as i could wish bless me we had better send for a doctor no sir i am in hopes it will soon be over  where is matilda  in her chamber sir i believe  he then called mrs susan and bid her tell matilda that he desired to speak with her but she answered that her mistress was gone to bed indisposed and requested that she might not be disturbed  supper being served up we sat down in silence and as neither of us offered to taste a bit i rose wished mr golding a good night and retired to my chamber  after a sleepless night my servant entered in a visible alarm and told me that miss golding was extremely ill and that almost all the physicians in london had been sent for  very unhappy were many succeeding days i saw my friend my father the man i loved above the world i saw him in a depth of distress that bordered on distraction and i found my heart wrung with inexpressible anguish  though i was constant in my enquiries after miss golding yet i purposely avoided appearing in her presence lest the sight of one so obnoxious should add to her distemper at length the good old man came to me wringing his hands will you not go harry says he will you not go and see matilda before she dies the doctors tell me they have tried all the powers of medicine but that they do not yet know what to make of her sickness  my dear sir said i it is then no longer time to conceal from you what i know or conjecture concerning this matter miss matilda herself entrusted me with the secret but under the strictest injunctions of silence the extremity of her case however ought to dispense with all such engagements your daughter loves sir she loves with passion but who the object of her affections is i cannot imagine let it be your part to discover what she so industriously hides from the world she will refuse nothing to the authority or rather to the tenderness of such a parent  here mr golding left me but returned in about an hour his whole frame seemed to labor with something extraordinary you were right harry he cried you were right in your conjectures my prayers and my tears have at length prevailed with difficulty i have wrung the secret from her o my son it is greatly in your power to befriend us would you not do something for the relief of a family who dote upon you as we do would you not do something for your old friend who loves you as fondly as ever father loved a child something for you sir said i yes every thing all things that are possible to be done but pray sir do i know the party you do harry you do he cried for as the prophet said unto david thou art the man  me sir i exclaimed impossible she cannot bear my sight she hates me she detests the ground i go upon not so said he not so she loves the very dust upon which you tread something surely is due in mitigation of the calamities which you have occasioned we lie at your mercy mr clinton my precious daughter and myself it is yours to bid us live or die at your pleasure to crush us into nothing or to restore us to existence to health to enjoyment will it hurt you my son to do us these great benefits is it a matter grievous to you to give happiness to those whose excess of love for you is their only misfortune a princely fortune attends you we and all we have are yours mr clinton we are desirous of depending on your bounty alone let the extremeness of my daughters affection for you excite something more kindly than hatred in your breast if not for her sake yet for mine my beloved harry let me beseech you to constrain yourself before her to affect some little tenderness some appearance of regard that may revive her awhile at least from the deplorable state under which she languishes  while he spoke i was agitated by unutterable emotions and he might have proceeded much further before i should have had the power to reply at length i cast myself on my knee and catching his hand to my bosom ah my friend my father my dear father i cried am i then no better than a barbarian in your sight to me would you impute such sentiments of cruelty and ingratitude take my hand sir take my heart dispose of them as you please all that i have all that i am is yours and your daughters without any kind of reserve for any other person breathing  the good man caught me in his arms and pressed me to his breast in a long and speechless ecstasy then taking me by the hand he led me in silence to his daughters apartment  as we entered she turned her eyes toward the door and her pale and languid countenance was straight suffused with a short lived red i was so affected by the condition in which i beheld her that i scarcely was able to reach her bedside where kneeling down i gently took one of her hands and pressing it between mine i bathed it in a silent shower of tears  ah my papa she faintly cried i fear you have betrayed me mr harry is certainly informed of my weakness i am informed said i my lovely my allbeloved sister i am informed that i am permitted to hope for a happiness that is infinitely above my merit but it shall be the delightful business of my life to deserve it  my dear said mr golding i perceive you are something flusterd your constitution is too weak for such emotions as these for the present your brother harry must leave you tomorrow i trust you will be better able to support our company  hereupon i took her hand and impressing upon it a tender and warm kiss i just ventured to look up and saw her fine eyes suffused with a glittering tear and her countenance bent upon me with a look of indescribable sweetness and delight but mr golding to prevent the effects of too tender a scene instantly took me by the arm and led me away  as he perceived that my spirits had been much disturbed he ordered a bottle to his own chamber and told me that he requested some further converse with me as soon as we had taken our seats he looked earnestly upon me then seized me by the hand and looked at me again but suddenly getting up he turned and stepped to the window and breaking into tears he there wept and sobbed for good part of an hour  as soon as he was somewhat composed he resumed his seat mr clinton says he are you really sincere in your professions with respect to my daughter shall i be rid of my doubts at once may i venture to ask you a question on which my own life as well as that of my child may depend should it please the almighty to raise her from her present bed of sickness is it actually your intention to make her your wife  here i demanded with some warmth is that a question sir at this time what reason have i given you to suspect my honor or my truth  i do not suspect you my harry i do not suspect you i know you would not deceive me but you may have deceived yourself your nature is tender and full of pity and in the deplorable estate in which my girl lies your great compassion may have easily been mistaken by you for love your friendship for me also may have helped to impose upon you and you may have construed your regard and attachment to the father into a sentiment of tenderness and affection for the child but o my harry should any other woman be preferable in your eyes or should it not be in my girls power to win and wear your affections i shall then have been instrumental in making you wretched and my heart may as well be broken the one way as the other  no my father no i have no foreign dalilahs no secret amors no pleasures that shun the light my heart is a virgin heart and my matilda possesses it without a rival  from the time that i was sensible of my fathers partiality a little matter of ambition whether laudable or otherwise incited me to attempt a distinction that would raise me toward a level with an only brother who looked down with neglect and contempt upon me thence i became indefatigable in my studies at school and college as also in my application under you sir during the first years of my apprenticeship and this left me no manner of leisure for female attachments indeed i dreaded the appearance of any advances from the sex and turned from them as i would from so many gins or pitfalls purposely dug for my destruction my conversation sir has been very little among the fair and excepting my natural propensity to the sex i never till very lately conceived a liking for any woman in truth my dear father that lady is not alive whom my judgment or inclinations would prefer to your matilda you need not fear my being wretched i think myself most happy in her affections  then said he i pronounce her the happiest of women and now my harry i will tell you a secret from the first time that i beheld you i wished you for my daughter i wished that she might have charms to attract and fix your heart but as i feared and was persuaded that this was not the case i forbore to indulge myself in such flattering expectations you know i never took you with me to see her at the boardingschool the true reason was that i dreaded exposing her young and inexperienced heart to such a temptation lest she should conceive and languish under a hopeless passion  on her return to town my apprehensions on your score were much abated as i imagined that the great number of her gay and glistering suitors would divide or at least divert her attention from you and i purposely laid all the business of our house on your shoulders that she might have as little of your company as possible  i further had the precaution to warn my child against the danger of any affection for you matty said i one day among all this assembly of fair and fortunate youths you are free and welcome to choose your companion for life there is only one who stands excepted one only whom you must not look upon with any eye of expectation who is that papa my young brother and partner in trade said i he looks much higher matty than to the daughter of a merchant his prospects are immense he is only brother and heir to the earl of moreland who is now on his travels a dissolute young man whose vices in all likelihood will quickly carry him off and in such a case our harry clinton would be considered as the first person in the land  ah sir i cried i may bless your prohibition with regard to me it was certainly the happy the only cause of my matildas partiality in my favor the good man smiled and proceeded notwithstanding what i said to matty i had not given up all thoughts of you myself while she talked or sung in your presence i often turned my eye upon you and thought at times that i perceived a growing tenderness in your behavior which further acquaintance i trusted might ripen into love but when in order to try you i proposed your advocation in behalf of spelling and that you appeared to undertake it with readiness and pleasure i at once dropped all my fond and flattering hopes concerning you and i heartily wished that my child had accepted that modest and worthy young man blessed however be the favoring hand of that providence who so unexpectedly has conducted matters to the issue of this hour and fulfilled the capital wish of my life but i will no longer delay carrying to my dear child the glad tidings of your affection it will prove the best of balms to her wounded mind and will close her eyes for this night in rest and peace of heart  i was scarce dressed the next morning when matildas favorite maid entered my chamber and bid me good morrow mrs susan said i your pleasant countenance bids me presume that miss golding is better  o vastly better vastly better sir i assure you she slept sweetly all the night and did not want for happy dreams either i warrant  here is something for your good news  no sir no i never take money from gentlemen my mistresss generosity does not leave me to the temptation i love my mistress sir and i think we ought all rather to join and fee you mr harry as well for yesterdays visit as for another which i hope you will pay her to day a fiddle for these old doctors one pretty young doctor is better worth than a score of them  susan as it should seem had been an observer and did not want for penetration in such matters  mr harry she continued i would give my last quarters wages to know what charm it is that you carry about you to make all the pretty ladies so fond of you  in truth mrs susan i am equally a stranger to the charm and to the fondness that you talk of  dont tell me sir dont tell me the very day of that night on which my mistress fell sick here was a lady in her chariot to enquire for you one of the loveliest young creatures i ever set my eyes on i know she asked very particularly and very affectionately for you for though it was my mistress to whom she spoke i stood within hearing  it must i cried have been some mistake or some imposture for i assure you mrs susan that i know of no such person but pray be so good as to bear my compliments to your young lady and tell her that i wait her permission to attend her  i forgot to tell you madam that agreeable to the advice which mr golding had given me i went to felicitate my uncle goodall on his marriage with your mother he had already been informed of my recent admission into partnership and thereupon received me with very unusual marks of esteem and affection  your mother at that time was exceeding lovely in her person and manners at every season of leisure i frequented their house and she conceived a very tender and warm friendship for me but during miss goldings illness i had not been to visit them  susan was but just gone when mr golding came and told me that he believed his matty would be pleased to see me i instantly obeyed the summons as i entered i observed that she sat up in her bed a morning gown was wrapped about her and susan with the help of pillows supported her behind on my appearing her spirits again took the alarm she scarce ventured a glance toward me i was greatly pained by the abashment under which i saw she labored and i hastened to relieve myself as well as her from the distress  i sat down by the bedside and gently taking one of her hands without looking in her face my dear miss golding said i i hope you will not be jealous of your papas affection for me he has indeed been too partial too generous toward me and has approved himself more than a father to me he is not satisfied with allowing me to call you by the tender name of sister he further gives me leave to hope that i may be united to you by the nearest and dearest of all ties nothing but your consent is wanting my sister to make me the happiest of mankind you are silent my matilda may i venture to call you mine blessed be your silence my angel i will dare then to interpret it in my own favor  indeed i should long since have made the present declaration i should long since have avowed my inclinations my affection my passion for you but i did not presume to listen to my own heart on the occasion i did not suffer it to tell me how much you were beloved amidst so many suitors of the first rank and merit who were justly called together by your numberless attractions i deemed it a flight by much too high for me to aspire at a competition for the happiness of your hand  here venturing to look up i perceived that she had put her handkerchief to her eyes ah mr clinton she cried with a trembling voice you are very delicate you are sweetly delicate indeed but ought i to take the advantage of this delicacy i see that you would save me from the confusion of an avowal you would save me from the mortifying sensibility of my own weakness but sir you ought not to esteem that a weakness in me which i account my chiefest merit and which is my chiefest pride i am proud of my gratitude i am proud of my discernment from the moment that you preserved me against arms and against odds at the great peril of your own life in you and you alone i saw every thing that was amiable every thing that was excellent but then i dreaded lest all women should behold you with my eyes and above all i doubly dreaded and was fearfully assured that you never would have any eyes or attention for me you have at length seen or are rather informed concerning my malady you pity me you wish to relieve me and you would love me if you could it is enough mr harry even this perhaps is quite as much of happiness as i can bear  here again i began to profess and to protest the sincerity and ardour of my affections but she cut me short and said i know your sincerity sir you are persuaded that you love me because as yet you know not what love is true love mr harry by its own light sees into and throughout the bosom of the party beloved i am very sensible of the tenderness of your friendship for me and that sensibility constitutes the whole of my happiness i trust also that it is all the happiness i shall ever desire to see you to hear you to have you with me to gaze upon you while you are looking another way to be permitted to attend to serve you to conduce to your satisfactions it is a lot that will lift me above that of mortality that will cause me to account myself the first among women  ah i cried can i say nothing can i do nothing to convince you how dear how exceedingly dear you are to me i certainly loved you long before i knew what it was to be a lover i now feel the united force of those imperceptible degrees by which the pleasing intruder daily stole and grew upon me believe me my matilda when i presumed to present you with this as a token of my affection i held it for a trifle altogether unworthy of you accept it however i beseech you for the sake of the giver  and is this the gem says she which i cast from me with such disdain  forgive me my brother it is just so that the world casts from them the pearl of much mightier price i would to heaven that i could reject all the pomps pleasures and vanities of this transitory world with the same aversion that i spurned from me this estimable jewel but there is very little hope of that mr harry while you yourself may be partly numbered among transitory things  here i was quite overcome by the affection of the dear girl and urged on by a sudden transport i caught her to my bosom with a force that was something too much for her weakness on recollection i attempted to apologize for my indiscretion but she sweetly cried ah mr harry never repent of such faults may i often may i daily tempt you to be guilty of them but tell me and tell me truly mr clinton these gems when you first purchased them were they actually intended for me were they not rather intended for your fanny for your own fanny mr clinton what can you mean i exclaimed i know of no fanny in the universe with whom i have any acquaintance that is strange she replied very extraordinary indeed but lest you should think me of a jealous or whimsical temper i will relate the affair to you precisely as it happened  on the day in which i took to my bed i was looking out at the parlout window when a chariot and six horses whirled up to our door i observed a single lady in it whom i supposed of my acquaintance and instantly sent susan to request her to walk in on her entering i was greatly struck by the beauty of her figure and eyed her very inquisitively from head to foot having curtesied gracefully to me can you tell me miss says she is mr clinton at home no indeed madam said i but if you will be pleased to entrust me with your commands  it is only miss that i request to see him as soon as possible  and pray madam where shall he attend you  o he will know that instantly when you tell him it was fanny goodall his own fanny goodall who was here to wait upon him  good heaven i cried out my aunt my aunt goodall my very aunt i assure you  what do you say what do you tell me your aunt sir can it be ah she is too young and too lovely to be an aunt mr harry  the very same indeed madam there is no other fanny goodall i admit as you say that she is young and exceeding lovely but still she is a wife and likely soon as i think to be a mother alas says my matilda what a doleful jest is this a cruel aunt she has been to me i am sure what days of sighs and nights of tears she has cost me ah that heartbreaking term his own his own fanny i think i shall never be able to forgive her that expression  as mr golding just then entered we dropped the subject we were upon why matty says he you are quite another creature i think i never saw you wear so happy a face i know you are come to chide me says she for keeping your partner from business but pay me down the portion you intended for me papa and i will reimburse you the damage of every hour of his absence yes my love cries the tender father if wealth might serve for wages to a heart like that of my harry he shall be very amply paid for every act and instance of his affection and attention to you every hour of my life i cried is already her due she has nothing to pay to one who is her debtor beyond account  during several following days miss golding recovered with amazing rapidity in less than than five weeks she looked plumper and fairer than ever peace smiled in her countenance joy laughed in her eyes her whole frame appeared as actuated by some internal music and thus all lovely and beloved she was given up to my arms in the presence of my uncle and aunt and of a few city friends  friend as i wish that none of your faults should pass by me unnoticed so i am willing to allow you all your just praises your story of your old friend is hitherto very simple natural and domestic and to a mind yet undebauched exceedingly interesting and affecting for it opens and investigates a number of little passages and mazes in the heart which are quite closed or imperceptible to persons of hard nerves and callous conceptions i am free however to tell you that i felt myself offended by the compliments which mr clinton pays to himself through the mouth of your matilda it is indeed a very rare matter for people to speak of themselves with due decency and delicacy i wish you could have procured some other conduit for conveying to us the history of your knight caesar i think is the only person who with an easy though modest confidence has successfully adventured on a detail of his own exploits   author i have not a word to say in mr clintons defense perhaps he may offer something for himself on the occasion   chap xiv here the countess for the first time broke in upon her cousins narration happy matilda she cried how distinguished was thy destiny were it but for a year were it but for a day for that day thou did yet enjoy the consummation of all thy wishes a lot rarely allowed to any daughter of adam i was not then born to envy her state sweet girl she deserved you she was after my own heart the excess of her passion for you made her truly worthy of you but tell me my cousin how could you be so long ignorant of the dear girls affection for you the language of love is so very intelligible so expressive through every motion and every organ as must with sufficient clearness have opened your eyes to the object indeed madam replied mr clinton she herself led me away from any such apprehension by drawing so many pictures of the man whom she said she loved all copied from the creature of her own brain and covered and disguised with such imaginary excellencies as must have prevented myself as well as every one living from perceiving therein the smallest trace of my own resemblance dont tell me cried lady maitland she was a true and a sweet painter and i should have known you by her portrait in the midst of a million but proceed i beseech you my whole soul is in your story  within a few months after my marriage continued mr clinton you my cousin first opened your fair eyes to the light and my matty and i had the honor of being your sponsors  within the first year of my marriage my girl also brought a son into the world and within the two years following was delivered of a daughter  the joy of the grandfather on those events was indescribable alas good man he thought that he perceived in their infant aspects a thousand happy promises and opening prospects he saw himself as it were perpetuated in a descending and widening progeny who like their native thames should roll down in a tide of expanding wealth and prosperity he wanted that all the world should participate of his happiness and our house once more became the house of festivity  a number of external successes also assisted to persuade us in those days that felicity was to be attained and ascertained upon earth the regency of cromwell was administered with the strictest justice at home while at the same time it became revered and formidable abroad and extended its influence to regions the most remote under the protection of the british flag we sent our ships out to the east and to the west and wealth came pouring in upon us from all quarters of the globe  in the mean while my wife and i lived together in perfect harmony though my commerce and acquaintance was greatly extended i had yet formed no friendships from home that partook of heartfelt tenderness except for your mama all my pleasures and desires all my world was in a manner confined and absorbed within the compass of my own walls in the good old man and his daughter and in the pledges of their endearing attachment to me every wish that my soul could form was centered mutual joy sat round our board mutual peace prepared our pillows and during a swimming period of six years i scarce remember to have experienced the smallest discontent save what arose from the inordinancy of my wifes affection for me  while she continued to bless my arms i thought that no one had ever loved with greater warmth than i loved her and yet at times i remarked a very striking difference between the manner and effects of our feelings for each other if business detained me an hour extraordinary abroad the panting of her bosom that eagerness of look with which she received me was to me a painful evidence of her anxiety during my absence one evening i found her in fainting fits merely because she was told that a duel had just happened between lord mohun and a person who had much the resemblance of her clinton in short if my head or my finger ached i found myself under the necessity of concealing my ailment and of assuming a cheerfulness disagreeable to the occasion to prevent the worse consequences of her ready alarms on the other hand my affection was tranquil and serene it was tender and fervent indeed but without tumult or disturbance a species of love which i afterward found to be by far the most eligible for every kind of passion is unquestionably a kind of suffering love in god therefore must be wholly an action it acts infinitely upon others without any possibility of being acted upon  thus the years of my life moved onward upon down when the smallpox that capital enemy to youth and beauty became epidemical in the city our children caught the contagion all possible care was taken and all possible art employed a number of physicians was kept constantly about them fifteen days of their illness were already elapsed and the doctors pronounced them out of danger when the distemper took a sudden and malignant turn and in one and the same minute both my babes expired in the arms of their mother  i was in the room at the time and as i knew the extreme tenderness of my mattys nature all my concern as well as attention was turned upon her i took her fondly by the hand and looking up to her face i was instantly alarmed and shocked by that placid serenity which appeared in her countenance and which i expected to be quickly changed into some frantic eruption but first dropping a smiling tear on her infants and then lifting her glistening eyes to heaven i thank thee i thank thee o my master she cried thou have made me of some use i have not been born in vain thou have ordained me the humble vehicle of two safe and certain angels living attendants on thy throne and sweet singers of thy praises in the kingdom of little children for ever and for ever i have yet sufficient left more blessings remaining than suit the lot of mortality take me from them i beseech thee whenever it is thy good pleasure for i fear there are some of them which i could not i could not bear to have taken away from me so prayed the dear saint and looking eagerly at me no my harry she cried out i fear i fear i could not bear it so saying she suddenly cast herself into my bosom and grasping at my neck and gushing into a flood of anguish we mingled our sobs and our tears together till no more were left to be shed  you are affected my dearest cousin i had better stop here if you are moved by small matters how would your heart be wrung by some ensuing distresses i must not venture to proceed  go on cried the countess go on i insist upon it i love to weep i joy to grieve it is my happiness my delight to have my heart broken in pieces  we were both of us much relieved by the vent of our mutual passion for though my wife still continued to keep to me and cling about me she yet seemed to be sweetly composed and sunk within my arms as into a bed and depth of peace  at length i listened to a kind of murmur and bustle in the hall and i heared some one distinctly cry o my master my master  we started up at the instant mr golding had been from home at the time of the deadly crisis of my two darling little ones and had quieted all his fears and renewed all his prospects in the view and full assurance of their life and quick recovery we had been too much engaged and occupied in our own personal griefs to give to our servants the seasonable precaution of breaking the matter to our father by unalarming degrees and a rude fellow at his entrance bluntly told him that the children were both dead whereupon he clapped his hands together and casting himself into a chair remained without sense or motion  when we ran up we were greatly terrified by the manner of his aspect though his eyes were closed his brows were gloomy and contracted while the nether part of his face looked quiet and composed  i instantly sent for a surgeon and recalled the physicians who had but lately left us while my matty stood motionless with her hands closed together and her eyes fixed upon her father at length she cried out my papa my papa my dear papa i would i would i had died before i came to this hour but blessed be thy will since it is thy will o god when all other props are sapped and plucked from under me i trust to fall into thee my father which art in heaven  being put to bed and bled he recovered motion and speech and we got him to swallow a composing draught though he did not yet recollect any person or thing about him  notwithstanding our late fatigues matty and i sat up with him most of the night and then ordering a pallet to be brought into the room we lay down to take a little rest toward morning alas said i to myself how rich was i yesterday how is my world abridged these narrow walls now contain all that is left me of all the possessions that i value upon earth  poor mr golding was but ill qualified to bear calamity his life had been a life of sound health and successes and he never had been acquainted with sickness or with affliction save on the death of his wife whom he had married for money and on the illness of his daughter as already related  as he had taken an opiate he did not awaken till it was late in the day turning his head toward me is it you harry says he how do you find yourself sir said i  why has any thing been the matter with me indeed i dont feel myself right but send my children to me send my jacky and my little harriet the sight of them will be a restorative beyond all the cordials in the world  you are silent harry  what is the meaning  o now i begin to remember  my sweet babies my little playfellows i shall never see you any more  here he burst into the most violent gush of passion he groaned he wept he cried aloud with heartpiercing exclamations while i caught up matty in my arms and running with her to a distant apartment catched a kiss and locked her in  i returned but found him in the same violence of agitation i spoke to him i would have comforted him but he cried be quiet harry i will not be comforted i will go to my children they shall not be torn from me we will die we will be buried we will lie in the same grave together  as i found myself sick and ready to faint under the oppression of his lamentations i withdrew to the next chamber and there plentifully vented the contagious shower  after some time i listened and perceived that all was quiet and returning i found him in a kind of troubled doze from whence he fell into a deep and peaceful sleep thus he continued for three days wailing and slumbring by fits without tasting any matter of nourishment though his daughter and i implored him on our knees and with tears no reasonings no entreaties could avail for appeasing him it was from the association of our sorrows alone that he appeared to admit of any consolation  at length his passion subsided into a sullen and silent calm he would speak to no body he would answer none of us except by monosyllables  within a few following weeks news was brought me that our ship the phoenix was arrived in the downs safe and richly laden from the east indies  immediately i carried the tidings to the old man in the pleasing expectation that they would serve to divert or at least to amuse his melancholy but fixing his look upon me wherefore harry do thou tell me of ships and indies he cried both indies are poor to me they have nothing that they can send me i have no road to go upon earth no way upon sea to navigate i am already become a wild and wasted babylon wherein the voice of music shall never more be heared o ye old and unblessed knees where are now your precious babies who were wont to play about ye and to cling and climb upon ye gone gone gone gone never never to return  here breaking into tears i cried we are both young yet my father we may yet have many children to be the comfort of your age no my harry no he replied you may indeed have many children but you never will have any children like my darling children  love as it should seem my cousin like bodies has its weight and gains additional velocity in the descent it descends from god to his creatures and so from creature to creature but rarely knows a due return of affection or gratitude it is therefore incomparably more intense in the parent than in the child and still acquires increasing fondness toward the grandchild and so downward nay you may almost universally observe it more warm in patrons toward their dependents than in those who are benefitted toward their benefactors  mr golding from this time no more entered his counting house nor paid nor received visits nor kept up any correspondence even my company and that of his daughter appeared to oppress him and he rarely left his apartment where an old folio bible was his only companion  hereupon i began to withdraw our effects from trade and having called in the best part of them i lodged near half a million in the dutch funds when i went to advise with my father on the occasion what my child said he what have i to say to the world or to the things of the world do just as you please with the one and with the other and never consult a person on any affair wherein the party consulted has no interest or concern  one morning as i lay in bed matty threw her arms about me and hiding her blushing face in my bosom my harry says she if you could handsomely bring it about to my poor papa perhaps it would be some matter of consolation to him to know that i am with child  when i broke the matter to him he did not at first appear to be sensibly affected in time however the weight of his affliction seemed considerably lightened and as my wife advanced in her pregnancy he began to look us in the face he sat with us at one table and became conversable as formerly  one day i went to dine with mr settle a hardware merchant who had appointed to pay me a large sum of money on my return in the evening through moorfields attended only by my favorite irishman a very faithful and active fellow though it was yet fair day i was suddenly set upon by a posse of robbers who rushed on me from behind a cover the first of them running up fired directly in my face but did me no further damage than by carrying away a small piece of the upper part of my left ear had the fools demanded my money i would have given it to them at a word but finding them bent on murder i resolved that they should have my life at as dear a rate as possible i instantly drew my sword and run the first through the body and then rushing on the second assailant i laid him also on the ground before he had time to take his aim so that his pistol went harmlesly off in his fall  in the mean while my brave and loving companion was not idle with two strokes of his oaken cudgel he had levelled two more of them with the earth hereupon the remainder halted retreated into a group and then stood and fired upon us altogether but observing that we did not drop they cast their arms to the ground and run off several ways as fast as they could my good friend tirlah odonnoh then turned affectionately to me are you hurt my dear master says he i believe i am tirlah let us make home the best we can o cried the noble creature if no body was hurt but tirlah tirlah wouldnt be hurt at all  here taking me under the arm we walked slowly to the city till coming to a hackney coach he put me tenderly into it and sitting beside me supported me as i began to grow weak through much effusion of blood  as soon as we got home the coachman as is their practice thundered at the door and my matty according to custom whenever i was abroad was the readiest of all our domestics to open  by this time i had fainted and was quite insensible but when my tender and true mate saw me borne by two men into her presence all pale and bloody she who thought she had fortitude to support the wreck of the world gave a shriek that was enough to alarm the neighborhood and instantly falling backward got a violent contusion in the hinder part of her head  immediately we were conveyed to separate beds and all requisite help was provided it was found that i had received six or seven flesh wounds but none of them proved dangerous as they were given at a distance and by pistol shot but alas my mattys case was very different she fell into sudden and premature labor and having suffered extreme anguish all the night during which she ceased not to enquire after me she was with difficulty delivered of a male infant who was suffocated in the birth  in the mean while the good and tenderhearted old gentleman hurried about incessantly from one of us to the other wringing his hands and scarcely retaining his senses  as soon as my wounds were dressed and i had recovered my memory i looked about and hastily enquired for my wife but they cautiously answered me that she was something indisposed with the fright which she got at seeing me bloody and that her father had insisted on her going to bed  on the second dressing of my wounds i was pronounced out of danger and then they ventured to tell me of my mattys miscarriage and of the bruise which she had got in her fall when she fainted on hearing this my heart was cleft as it were in twain i accused myself of the murder of my wife and infant and i accused all without exception of their indiscretion in not concealing my disaster from her  at times i began to fear that my wife was either dead or much worse than they represented on my third dressing therefore i peremptorily insisted on my being carried into her chamber i sent her notice of my visit and on entering the room he lives then she cried my husband my harry lives it is enough i shall die happy i shall now depart in peace  here i ordered myself to be laid by her side when taking a hand which she had feebly reached out and pressing it to my lips you would forsake me then my matty you die you say and you die happy in leaving me the most wretched the most desolate of men you die my love you die and i who would have fostered you and your babe with my vitals it is i who have dug a grave for the one and for the other but you must not forsake me my matty i will not be forsaken by you since we cannot live asunder let us die let us die together  here a passionate silence ensued on either part but my wounds growing painful and beginning to bleed afresh i was obliged to be carried back to my own apartment  within a few days more i was so well recovered as to be able to walk about from which time i was a constant attendant on my beloved and became her most tender and assiduous nursekeeper  you must have heard my cousin that the customs and manners of those times were altogether the reverse of what they are at present hypocrisy is no longer a fault among men all now is avowed libertinism and open profaneness and children scoff at the name and profession of that religion which their fathers revered on the contrary in those days all men were either real or pretended zealots every mechanic professed like aaron to carry a urim and thummim about him and no man would engage in any business or bargain though with an intent to overreach his neighbor without going apart as he said to consult the lord  my matty at the same time was the holiest of all saints without any parade of sanctification here is was a religion of whose value she had the daily and hourly experience it was indeed a religion of power it held her as on a rock in the midst of a turbulent and fluctuating world it gave her a peace of spirit that smiled at provocation it gave her comfort in affliction patience in anguish exaltation in humiliation and triumph in death  in about five weeks after her unhappy miscarriage she appeared on the recovery though by very slow degrees and with assistance at times sat up in her bed when her oldest physician one morning called me apart i am loath sir said he very loath to acquaint you with my apprehensions i wish i may be mistaken but i fear greatly for you i fear that your dear lady cannot recover by the symptoms i conjecture that an abscess or impostume is forming within her but a few days will ascertain matters either for us or against us  had all sorts of evil tidings come crowding one upon other i should not have been affected as i then was affected i could not rise from my seat to bid the doctor adieu my knees trembled under me a swimming came before my eyes and a sudden sickness relaxed and reversed my whole frame alas i had not at that time the resource of my matty i had not on the armor with which she was armed to all issues and events i however raised my thoughts to heaven in a kind of helpless acquiescence rather than confident resignation i struggled not to appear weaker than became my manhood and i said to myself doctors have often been mistaken  having recollected my strength and spirits the best i could i adventured to enter my wifes apartment she was just raised in her bed from whence her pale and emaciated countenance looked forth as the sun toward his setting looks through a sickly atmosphere in confidence of his arising in the fullness of morning glory  having cautiously and dejectedly seated myself beside her she reached out both her hands and pressing one of mine between them i love you no longer my harry she cried i love you no longer your rival at length has conquered  am the bride of another and yet i love you in a measure since in you i love all that is him or that is his and that i think is much a great deal indeed of all that is lovely o my dear my sweet mine only enemy as i may say riches were nothing unto me pleasures were nothing unto me the world was nothing unto me you and you only harry stood between me and my heaven between me and my god long and often and vainly have i strove and struggled against you but my bridegroom at length is become jealous of you my true owner calls me from you and takes me all to himself be not alarmed then my harry when i tell you that i must leave you you will grieve for me you will grieve greatly for me my beloved but give way to the kindly shower that your lord shed for his lazarus and let the tears of humanity alleviate and lighten the weight of your affliction  ah my harry i tremble for you what a course you have to run  what perils what temptations deliver him from them my master deliver him from them all  again what blissful prospects  they are gone they are vanished  i sink i die under the weight and length of succeeding misery  again it opens all is cleared and his end like that of job is more blessed than his beginning  ah my harry my harry your heart must be wrung by many engines it shall be tried in many fires but i trust it is a golden heart and will come forth with all its weight  you have been dreaming my love i said you have been dreaming and the impression still lies heavy and melancholy on your memory  yes she replied i have been dreaming indeed but then my dreams are much more real then my waking visions when all things sensible are shut out it is then that the spirit enlarges grows conscious of its own activity its own power and prescience and sees by a light whose evidence is beyond that of the sun i will tell you a secret my harry there is nothing in the universe but littleness and greatness the littleness of the creature and the greatness of god and in the sense of this lies the essence of all philosophy and of all religion be content then with your lot my husband be content to be little if you wish to be great become a nothingness an emptiness and then your god will bring the fullness of his own immensity upon you and will open a world in your spirit more expanded and more glorious than this surrounding world with all its luminaries  o my angel i cried should any thing happen to you i should then be little indeed but i dare not look that way for i know i find i feel that i could not survive you  you must survive me my harry nay you will once more be married i beheld your bride last night even now she stands before me the sister of my spirit and one of the loveliest compositions of sin and death that ever was framed for dissolution her also you will lose and you will think nay you will assure yourself that no powers in heaven or earth can avail for a ray of comfort in this life however you will finally unexpectedly and most wonderfully be blessed and soon after we shall all meet and be more intimately and more endearingly wedded than ever where yet there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage  while she yet spoke her pains as the pains of labor again came upon her and went off and again returned after intermitted swoonings  o my cousin what a solemn what a fearful thing is death all our inlets of knowledge and sensation closed at once the sound of cheer and the voice of friendship and the comfort of light shut out from us for ever nothing before us but a blackness and depth of oblivion or beyond it a doubtful and alarming sensibility strange scenes and strange worlds strange associates and strange perceptions perhaps of horrid realities infinitely worse than nonentity such are the brightest prospects of infidelity in death  where at that time are your scoffers your defiers of futurity where your merry companions who turn their own eternity into matter of laugh and ridicule dejected and aghast their countenance wholly fallen and their heart sunk within them they all tremble and wish to believe in this the hour of dissolution they feel their existence sapped and sinking from under them and nature compells them in the drowning of their souls to cry out to something to any thing save save or i perish  far different was the state of my little and lowly matty my saint of saints at that tremendous period where all others would have sunk there she soared aloft and she dropped the world and its wealth with her body and all the sensible affections thereof with the same satisfaction that a poor man just come to a great estate would drop his tattered garb to put on gorgeous apparel  oh my beloved she would cry in the midst of her pains i have been weakly through life i have been weakness itself and therefore not able to take up thy cross but be thou strong in my weakness show thy mightiness in me and then lay it upon me with all its weight  again after a swoon and when her pangs became excessive i refuse not thy process my master she cried thy cross and thorny crown they are all my ambition point thy thorns twist them harder let them pierce into my soul so thou suffer me not to fail or fall from thee i care not  think my cousin what i endured upon that occasion my rending heart shared her sufferings and felt pang for pang nay i was not far from murmuring and questioning with my god on his putting to such tortures the most guiltless of his creatures if the lambs of thy flock i secretly said if thy lambs are appointed to such excruciating sensations what must be the portion of such sinners as i am  when she drew near the goal of her blessed course upon earth o my almighty samson she faintly cried thou shakest the two pillars of my frail and sinful fabric finish then thy conquest in me down down with the whole building appointed to ruin let no one o lord of mine enemies or of thine enemies escape thy victorious arm but slay all those by my death with whom i have been vainly combating during my lifetime so saying her pains in an instant forsook her the form of her countenance was suddenly changed from the expression of agony into that of ecstasy she raised her hands on high and exerting herself to follow them she cried i come i come then sighed and dropped over  the muscles of her face still retained the stamp of the last sentiment of her soul and while the body hastened to be mingled with earth it seemed to partake of that heaven to which its spirit had been exalted  you may think it odd dearest madam that for some time past i have taken no note of the man to whom i was tied by every possible band of duty gratitude and affection the fact is that during the latter part of my wifes illness and for some weeks after her death mr golding was confined to his chamber by a severe fit of the gout and the acuteness of his pains scarce permitted him to attend to any other concern while my matty lived therefore i divided my time and assiduities as equally as i could between the daughter and father and at any intervals of ease i used to read to him his favorite passages in the bible  as soon as my saint had expired i charged the servants not to give any intimation of her death to their master but alas our silence and our looks were too sure indicators of the fatal tidings for from the highest to the least my matty had been the idol of the whole house and her death appeared to them as the loss of every earthly possession  having looked several times intently and inquisitively in my face well harry says mr golding all is over then i see we must go to her but my child shall no more return to us  you are silent my harry  o thou fell glutton death i had but one morsel left for the whole of my sustenance and that too thou have devoured here he gave a deep groan and sunk into a state of insensibility from which however he was soon recovered by the return of an anguishing fit of the gout  when i look back my fair cousin on the passages of my life it is a matter of amazement to me that a creature so frail so feebly and so delicately constituted as man with nerves so apt to be racked and a heart to be wrung with anguish can possibly endure under the weights of calamity that at times are laid upon him  i had not yet dropped a tear i was in a state of half stupid and half flighty insensibility as one who having lost every thing had nothing further to look for and therefore nothing to regard but when i saw my dear old man my best friend my father whelmed under such a depth of affliction all the sluices of my soul and inmost affections were laid open and i broke into an avowed passion of tears and exclamations till like david in his strife of love with jonathan i exceeded i accused myself of all the evils that had happened to his house and i devoted the day to darkness and the night to desolation wherein by my presence and connections i had brought those mischiefs upon him the good man was greatly struck and i think partly consoled by the excess of my sorrows and all desolate as he was he attempted to administer that comfort to me which he himself wanted more than any who had life  break not your heart my harry break not your heart my child he cried deprive me not of the only consolation that is left me you are now my only trust my only stay upon earth a wretched merchant i am whose whole wealth is cast away save thee thou precious casket thou only remnant of all my possessions my girl indeed was thy true lover the tenderest of all mates her love to thee my son was passing the love of woman but we have lost her we have lost her and wailing is all the portion that is left us below  as soon as the family heard the voice of our mourning they too gave a loose to the impatience of their griefs and all the house was filled with the sound of lamentation  on the following day i summoned the chief medical artists and got the precious remains of my angel embalmed she was laid under a sumptuous canopy with a silver coffin at her beds foot and every night when the house was at rest i stole secretly from my bed and stretched myself beside her i pressed her cold lips to mine i clasped her corse to my warm bosom as though i expected to restore it to life by transfusing my soul into it i spoke to her as when living i reminded her of the several tender and endearing passages of our loves and i reminded her also of the loss of our little ones by whom we became essentially one inseparably united in soul and body for ever  there is surely my cousin a species of pleasure in grief a kind of soothing and deep delight that arises with the tears which are pushed from the fountain of god in the soul from the charities and sensibilities of the human heart divine  true true my precious cousin replied the countess giving a fresh loose to her tears o matilda i would i were with thee true my cousin i say even now i sink i die under the pleasure of your narration  upon the ninth night continued mr clinton as i lay by the side of all that remained of my matty overtoiled and overwatched i fell into a deep sleep my mind notwithstanding at the time seemed more awake and more alive to objects than ever in an instant she stood visible and confessed before me i saw her clearer than at noon day by the light which she cast with profusion abroad every feature and former trace seemed heightened into a luster without a loss of the least similitude she smiled ineffable sweetness and blessedness upon me and stooping down i felt her embrace about my heart and about my spirit while at the same time i saw her bent in complacence before me after a length of ecstatic pleasure which i felt from her communion and infusion into my soul my harry says she grieve not for me all the delights that your world could sum up in an age would not amount to my bliss no not for an hour it is a weight of enjoyment that in an instant would crush to nothing the whole frame of your mortality grieve not then for me my harry but resign my beggarly spoils to their beggarly parent ashes to ashes and dust to dust in my inordinate fondness for you i have at length obtained a promise that my master and your master my beloved and your lover shall finally bear you triumphant through all the enemies that are set in fearful array against you having so said i felt myself as it were compressed within an engine of love and again losing the remembrance of all that had passed i sunk as into a state of utter oblivion  toward the dawning i was awakened by the clapping of hands and the cries of lamentation starting up i perceived mr golding at the bedside suspended over his matty and me and pouring forth his complaints  there was a favored domestic of his a little old man who had always kept a careful and inquisitive eye over every thing that was in or concerned our household this argus it seems at length suspected my nightly visits to the dead and lurking in a corner saw me open and enter the chamber where the corpse was deposited as he lay in his masters apartment he took the first opportunity of his being awake to impart what he thought a matter of extraordinary intelligence to him sir says he if i am not greatly deceived my young master is this moment in bed with his dead lady what is this you tell me cried mr golding no john no what you say is impossible all who live love that which is living alone whatever savours of death is detestable to all men as i am here replied john i am almost assured that what i tell you is fact peace peace you old fool said mr golding think you that our harry is more loving than father abraham and yet abraham desired to bury his dead out of his sight i know not how that may be said trusty john but if you are able to stir i will help you to go and see i am sure the thought of it melts the very heart within me  accordingly mr golding like old jacob strengthened himself and arose and pained as he was he came with the help of his john to the place where i lay  having for some time looked upon me as i slept with his matty fast folded in my arms he could no longer contain his emotions but he and john broke forth into tears and exclamations o my children my children my dearest children he cried why did ye exalt me to such a pitch of blessedness was it only to cast me down into the deeper gulf of misery a gulf that has neither bank nor bottom  as i arose all ashamed to be detected in that manner the good man caught me in his arms my harry my harry says he what shall i pay you my son for your superabundant love to me and to mine could my wretchedness give you bliss i should almost think myself blessed in being wretched my harry  i now prepared to execute the late command of my angel and to consign to earth the little that was earthly in her but when our domestics understood that all that was left of their loved mistress was now going to be taken away from them for ever they broke into tears anew and set no bounds to their lamentations  her desolate father was desirous of attending the funeral but on my knees i dissuaded him from it as i was assured it would burst in twain the already overstretched thread of his age and infirmities he then insisted on having the lid of the coffin removed and bending over he cast his old body on the corse again he rose and gazed upon it and clapping his hands with a shout is this my world he cried the whole of my possessions are you the one that was once my little prattling matty the playfellow of my knees the laugher away of care who brought cheer to my heart and warmth to my bosom are you the one for whom alone i spent my nights in thought and my days in application is this all that is left then of my length of labors o my spark of life is quenched in thee my matty my matty the flowing fountain of my existence is dried up for ever  there is something exceedingly solemn and affecting my cousin in the circumstances and apparatus of our funerals they are oppressive even to minds that are no way concerned or interested in the death of the party lamented though i grieved no more for my matty though i was as assured of her bliss as i was of my own being yet when the gloom of the procession was gathered around me when i heard the wailings of the many families whom her charity had sustained when i heard the bitter sobbings of the servants whom her sweetness had so endearingly attached to her person when all joined to bewail themselves as lost in her loss my heart died as it were within me and i should have been suffocated on the spot had i not given instant way to the swell of my sorrows  the tempest of the soul madam like that of the elements can endure but for a season the passion of mr golding on the interment of every joy and of every hope that he could look for upon earth within a few weeks subsided or rather sunk into a solid but sullen peace a kind of peace that seemed to say there is nothing in this universe that can disturb me  harry said he one evening i have been thinking of the vision that i have had vision sir said i has my matty then appeared to you yes he answered she was the principal part of my vision for these twenty years past the vision that i mean my harry is the dream of a very long and laborious life here have i by the toil of fifty years application scraped together and accumulated as much as in these times would set kings at contention and be accounted a worthy cause for spilling the blood of thousands and yet what are these things to me or of what value in themselves more than the stones and rubbish that make our pavement before the door i have been hungering and thirsting after the goods of this world i have acquired all that it could give me and now my soul like a sick stomach disgorges the whole i then took one of his hands and pressing it tenderly between mine o my father i cried my dear dear father o that i might be made sons and daughters and every sort of kindred to you all that i am and have should gladly be spent in bringing any kind of comfort to you my father  in about a fortnight after as i entered his apartment to bid him good morrow i observed that his countenance had much altered from what it was the evening before that he looked deeply dejected and seemed to breathe with difficulty  are not you well sir no says he my spirits are greatly oppressed i find that i must leave you shortly i believe that i must go suddenly but where to that is the question the very terrible question the only question of any importance in heaven or on earth sure sir said i that can be no question to you whose whole life has been a continued course of righteousness of daily worship to god and good will to all men if you have any sins to account for they must be covered tenfold by the multitude of your charities  talk not harry said he of the filthy rags of my own righteousness i am far from the confidence of the boastful pharisee alas i have not even that of the poor and humbled publican for i dare not look up to say lord be merciful to me a sinner wherefore then do you speak of having finished my course toward god and toward man it is but lately very lately that i set out upon it and i am cut short before i i have got within sight of the goal yes harry i fear i know i feel that there is no salvation for me  you amaze me sir said i you terrify me to death if there is not salvation for such as you what a depth of perdition opens for the rest of mankind  i would you could convince me he cried i want to be comforted i desire comfort any kind of consolation but i feel my condemnation within myself moreover i see every text of the gospel of the words of life terribly marshalled and set in broad array against me what text sir said i i am sure i know of no texts that bring terror or condemnation to the just ah harry he replied justice is of the law and the circumcision and has nothing to do with the new covenant or the new man for what says the great apostle circumcision avails nothing neither uncircumcision but a new creature for christ himself had said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god again the same apostle says i delight in the law of god after the inward man and again my little children of whom i travel in birth again until christ be formed in you now if all these corresponding expressions of being born again a new creature a new man an inward man christ formed in us etc are to be glossed and explained away as meaning little more than a state of moral sentiments and moral behavior there can be nothing of real import in the gospel of christ  again hear what the redeemer says except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven again if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me again whosoever he be of you that forsakes not all that he has he cannot be my disciple etc  if these things i cried are to be taken according to the apparent sense and import of the letter neither the teachers of the gospel nor those who are taught can be saved  therefore replied he it is said that many be called but few chosen and again enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many they be which go in thereat because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leads unto life and few there be that find it o my harry my harry our lives have been employed in seeking and loving the world and the things of the world therefore the love of the father could not be in us o that i had never been born o thou god whose tribunal at this hour is set up so tremendously against me at length i feel the propriety of thy precepts in rejecting the world and all that is therein for what can they yield save a little food and raiment to bodily corruption or incitements to that pride which cast lucifer into a gulf that now opens before me without a bottom  as i trembled and had nothing to answer i proposed to bring some of our clergy to him no harry no says he i will have none of their wordy comforts i will not cast my soul upon bladderd expectations can they persuade me that i am one of the few who are chosen can they tell me wherein i have striven to enter at the strait gate where many shall seek to enter but shall not be able  here he sunk into a a fit of agonizing desperation so that a cold dew broke forth from all parts of his body and fell drop after drop down his ghastly and fearful countenance never madam never did i feel such a kind of anguishing horror as i then felt i was affrighted and all frozen to my inmost soul haste my dear sir exclaimed lady maitland make haste through this part of your narration i beseech you i also feel for myself i am terrified to the last degree  at length continued mr clinton i recollected myself a little my master i cried my father my dearest father since you will not take comfort in your own righteousness take comfort in that of him who was made righteousness for you do you not now reject the world do you not now deny yourself i do i do he said i detest the one and the other and do you not feel that youre wholly a compound of sin and of death ay he cried there is the weight there is the mountain under which i sink for ever come then to christ my father heavy laden as you are and he will questionless embrace you and be rest to you my father i would come harry he cried but i dare not i am not able strive my father do but turn to him and he will more than meet you cry out with sinking peter save lord or i perish and he will catch you with the hand of his ever ready salvation  here his countenance began to settle into an earnest composure and his eyes were turned and fixed upward while his old and enfeebled body continued to labor under the symptoms of near dissolution at length he started and seizing my hand with a dying pressure there is comfort harry there is comfort he cried and expired  i was now cast once more upon a strange and friendless world all the interests of my heart were buried with this family and i seemed to myself as without kindred or connections in the midst of mankind your dear mama indeed sometimes called to condole with me and water my losses with her tears and in her and you my cousin young as you then were was locked up and centered the whole stock that i had left of endearing sensations  as the scenes of my former happiness served daily and nightly to render me more wretched by a sad recollection i determined to quit my house and to take private lodgings for this purpose i summoned mr goldings domesties and as he had made no will i first paid them their wages and then gave them such pretended legacies as brought their tears and their blessings in a shower upon me  as soon as i had discharged all except the two favorite servants of my master and my matty i desired that john our little old man should be sent to me  john said i as he entered here is a bill for five hundred pounds which our good old master has left you in token of his acknowledgment of your true and loving services and to help with what you have saved to soften and make easy the bed of death in your old age do you mean to part with me sir said john seemingly thankless and unconcerned about the gift which i had offered him indeed john said i in my present state of dejection attendance of any kind would but be an encumbrance to me then sir you may keep your bounty to yourself for i shall break my heart before five and twenty hours are over nay john said i i am far from turning you from me stay with me as my friend and welcome but not as my servant and i shall see the comfort of old times in always seeing you about me thank you thank you sir he cried i will not disturb you with my tears but i should die unblessed i should die unblessed if i died out of your presence so saying he rushed from me in a fit of restrained passion  i then sent for my wifes maid whom i formerly mentioned she had just heard of my discharging the other servants and entered with a sad and alarmed countenance come near mrs susan i am going to part with you said i come to me and give me a farewell kiss she approached with downcast looks when taking her in my arms i pressed and kissed her repeatedly and scarce witheld my tears o my girl my mattys precious girl i cried i am not forgetful of your love your honor and your disinterestedness toward us here my susy your darling mistress presents you with this bill of a thousand pounds and if you choose i will give you cash for it within a quarter of an hour this however does not discharge me from my regard and attention to you you are of a helpless sex my susy that is subject to many impositions and calamities wherefore when this sum shall fail you come to me again come to me as to your friend as to your debtor susy and i will repeat my remembrance and repeat it again as you may happen to have occasion for while i have sixpence left the favorite friend of my matty shall not want her proportion  here the grateful and amazed creature threw herself on the floor she cried aloud while the family heard and echoed to her lamentations she clasped my knees she kissed my feet again and again i could not disengage myself i could not force her from me o my master she cried my all that is left to me of my adored my angel mistress must i then be torn from you must you live without the service of the hands and heart of your susy but i understand your regard and care for me my master it is a cruel and naughty world and must be complied with  here i compelled her to rise and kissing her again i turned hastily to the chamber where my mattys corpse had been laid and bolting the door and casting myself on the bed i broke into tears and at length wept myself to sleep  while i was preparing to leave the once loved mansion i found in mr goldings cabinet a parchment that much surprised me on my marriage he had proposed to make a settlement of his fortune upon me which however i obstinately refused to accept whereupon without my privity he got this deed perfected which contained an absolute conveyance to me of all his worldly effects and possessions and this again renewed in me the tender and endearing remembrance of each of those kindnesses and benefits which he had formerly conferred upon me  i now found myself in possession of near a million of money which however in my disposition of mind at the time appeared no worthier than so much lumber in a waste room and i know not how it was that through the subsequent course of my life although i was by no means of an oeconomical turn though i never sued for a debt nor gave a denial to the wants of those who asked nor turned away from him who desired to borrow of me yet uncoveted wealth came pouring in upon me  it was not without some sighs and a plentiful shower that i departed from the seat of all my past enjoyments i took lodgings within a few doors of your father and my little household consisted of my favorite irishman my little old man two footmen and an elderly woman who used daily to dress a plain dish of meat for us  it was then my fairest cousin that your opening graces and early attractions drew me daily to your house my heart was soothed and my griefs cheared by the sweetness of your prattle and i was melted down and minted anew as it were by the unaffected warmth and innocence of your caresses  as i had no faith in dreams not even in that of my matty i thought it impossible that i should ever marry again i therefore resolved in my own mind to make you my heir and to endow you in marriage with the best part of my fortune  but you are a little pale madam you look dejected and fatigued if you please i will suspend my narration for the present and in the morning if you choose it as early as you will i shall renew and proceed in my insignificant history  here he pressed her hand to his lips she withdrew with a tearful eye and a heaving heart and the next day he resumed his narration as follows  chap xv though you my cousin at that time were a great consolation to me and a sweet lightner of my afflictions yet the griefs of heart which i had suffered were not without their effect at length they fell on my constitution and affected my nerves or spirits i think our doctors pretty much confound the one with the other accordingly i was advised to travel for change of air and exercise and i was preparing for my journey when there happened in my family the most extraordinary instance of an ever watchful providence that occurs to my memory  my little old man john began to decline apace and at length took to his bed and having a tender friendship for him i went to sit beside him and to comfort him the best i could john said i are you afraid to die no sir not at all not in the least i long to be dissolved and to be with our loving lord indeed john said i i am inclined to think you have been a very good liver a dog sir a mere dog desperately wicked the vilest of sinners i am a murderer too my master there is blood upon my head blood said i and started yes sir replied john but then the blood that was shed for me is stronger and more precious than the blood that was shed by me blood however john is a very terrible thing are you not afraid to appear before the judgment seat of christ by no means my dear master i have long since laid the burden of my sins before him for i had nothing else to bring to him nothing else to offer him and he has accepted them and me and my conscience is at rest in him then john there may yet be room for hope there is assurance my master for i have laid hold upon the rock and cannot be shaken  but how do you intend to dispose of your worldly substance all that i have sir i got with you and my old master and where i found it even there i resolve to leave it indeed john i will not finger a penny of your money how much may it amount to eight hundred and thirty seven pounds sir or thereabout and have you no relations of your own not one living that i know of then think of some one else for no part of it shall lie on my conscience i assure you  i have read somewhere or other sir of a great king who was advised of god in a dream to take the very first man whom he should meet the next morning to be his partner in the government now if it pleases you my master i will follow the like counsel and whosoever shall be first found before our door let that person be the owner and inheritor of my substance it shall be even as you say i will go and see whom god shall be pleased to send to us  accordingly i went and opened our door when a woman who had nearly passed turned about at the noise and perceiving me came up and said a little charity sir for the sake of him who had not where to lay his head  i was strongly affected by the manner in which she addressed me and eyeing her attentively i observed that she was clean though meanly apparelled wherefore to make a further trial whether our adventure was likely to prove prosperous or not i slipped a guinea into her hand and desired her to go about her business accordingly she courtesied and went from me a few steps when looking into her hand she turned suddenly back sir sir says she here had like to have been a sad mistake you meant to give me a shilling and you have given me a whole guinea it was says i a very great mistake indeed but be pleased to come in and we will try to rectify our errors  here i took her into the chamber where john lay and having constrained her to sit down i put my hand in my pocket here good woman said i here are ten guineas for you to make you some amends for the mistake i was guilty of in giving you but one the poor creature could scarcely credit her senses but raising her eyes in ecstacy and dropping from the chair upon her knees she was proceeding to bless me but i peremptorily insisted on her retaking her seat mistress said i be pleased to stay your prayers for the present what i want from you is the story of your life tell me who and what you are without suppressing any circumstances or concealing the faults of which you have been guilty and i will make you the mistress of twenty guineas that shall be added to what you have already received  sir said she you frighten me my story is a very unhappy and a very foolish story and cannot be of the smallest consequence to you sure you are too much of the gentleman to desire to ensnare me and indeed i know not of any thing whereby i may be ensnared wherefore bountiful sir unto you as unto heaven i will open my whole soul without seeking to know why you look into the concerns of such a worm as i am  i was the daughter of a farmer in essex my maiden name was elenor damer i was married early in life to a man who kept a chandlers shop in a little lane that led to tower hill his name was barnaby tirrell barnaby tirrell exclaimed john are you very sure that his name was barnaby tirrell peace john i cried whatever you may know of this man or of any other matter i command you not to interrupt the woman till she has finished her story  she then continued  i had neither brother nor sister sir but one brother a twin brother and we loved one another as though there was no body else in the world to be loved  about three years before my marriage my brother tommy then a sweet pretty lad took to a seafaring life and went from me i knew not where upon a voyage that i was told was a very great way off and so i cried day and night as many tears after him as would have served me to swim in  my husband was very fond of me and when he used to see me cry while i spoke of my tommy he would kiss me and try to comfort me and say that he wished for nothing more than his return to old england that he might welcome him and love him as much as i did  one night on the ninth month of my marriage as i sat moping and alone my husband being abroad upon some business i heard a knocking at the door which was opened by our little servant girl and then before you could say this in leaped my brother and catched me fast in his dear arms  i gave a great shout for joy you may be sure and pushing my tommy from me and pulling him to me again and again we embraced and cried and kissed and embraced and kissed again as though we never could be tired  in the mean while the door being open my cruel barnaby entered unperceived by either of us and seeing a strange man so fond and familiar with me he opened a long hasped knife which he had in his pocket and rushing up he gave my darling brother three stabs in the body before he could speak a word or turn about to defend himself then casting down the knife in a minute he was out of the house and i never saw him more  for a time i stood like a stone and then giving a great shriek i fainted and fell on my brother as he lay weltring in his blood  our little mary in the while being frighted almost to death ran about like a wild thing and alarmed the street our neighbors crowded in and sent for the next surgeon my brothers wounds were probed and dressed and he was laid in our spare bed  mean time being forward with child i fell into strong and untimely labor and after very grievous travail was delivered of a boy who was christened and called james after my dear and lately deceased father  no pains of my own however kept me from enquiring after that dear and lamented brother who had been killed as i supposed for his love to me but his youth and natural strength carried him through all dangers in three months he was up and about as well as ever and in less than three more he set out on another voyage from whence he never never o never returned  before he went abroad my dear and sweet fellow had left me a note of hand for the receipt of his wages but in five years after i heard that he was cast away or killed by the barbary people and though i went and went again in the middle of my wants and in the the middle of my sorrows to ask and to petition for his pay from the admiralty i never could get an answer of any profit or any comfort  my little jemmy however grew and throve and prated apace and was my only prop under all my afflictions my husband indeed had left me in pretty circumstances and had he but stayed with me we should have prospered above our fellows but what can a woman do single weak and unprotected i was imposed upon by some by others i was refused payment for the goods that i had given and at length i was reduced to poverty and obliged to shut up shop  mean time i had spared no cost on the bringing up of my jemmy i had given him school learning and he now was grown a very towardly and clever boy and having taken to messages my sweet fellow over night used to bring to me whatever he had earned in the day time  in the loss of my husband and brother in the loss of my barnaby and in the loss of my tommy to be sure i had grief upon grief so that my health went from me and next my strength went from me and i was not able to work at the washing business as before but this didnt signify much while my child had his health for he had now got a porters place in the customhouse and young as he was he willingly carried heavy burdens to have the pleasure of bringing home his hard earnings to his mammy but about six weeks ago may it please your honor my dear boy fell ill of a quartan ague as they call it under which he and his mothers heart still continue to labor  as soon as she had ended her short narrative well john said i methinks this business will do in my opinion you have got a very worthy inheritor of your fortune what say you to it john first sir let me ask her a question or two if you please honest woman draw your chair a little nearer to me i pray you and now tell me the truth did you ever love your husband yes dearly indeed very dearly did i love him for he had loved me very dearly till that miserable night but when as i thought he had killed my brother i hated him as much as i had ever loved him before but then again when my tommy had recovered of his wounds i sent far and near to enquire after him and find him out and when i could learn no tidings of him i put it into all the printed papers that thomas damer was well recovered and that barnabas tirrel who had wounded him might return without danger to his wife and infant  and he is returned shouted john he is returned my nelly your barbarous and bloody husband who stabbed your brother and left you and your infant to famish he is returned to you my nelly and in his death he shall make you amends for all the sufferings which he brought upon you during his lifetime but my master my dearest master send immediately for my child my jemmy i beseech you that bad as i am myself i may give him a fathers blessing before i die  i was surprised and affected madam beyond expression by incidents that were at once so wonderful and so tender and i directly sent servants and a sedanchair for james with orders to have him carefully and warmly wrapped up for what his mother told me of him had already given me a very strong prejudice in his favor  mean while mrs tirrel had sunk on her knees by her husbands bedside and was plentifully pouring forth her tears upon him partly for joy of having found him and partly for grief of having found him in that condition  o my nelly my nelly cried barnabas had i known who the person was whose blood i drew that terrible night i would sooner have thrust my knife into my own heart than into any part of the body of that dear brother of yours but i was old and ugly you know and you were young and handsome and jealousy is a mad devil that rages in the breast like hellfire it never knew how to spare but tears and consumes every thing that comes within its reach  at length james was brought to us and as we were in his fathers apartment a chamber no way adorned james entered without any respect to persons he was a tall and comely youth but very pale and lean and as it was one of his well days he walked in without help he had barely been told that his mother sent for him in a hurry so that he entered with a visible alarm in his countenance  what is the matter my dear mother says he alas i am little able to help you at present i hope nothing has happened that is suddenly distressful nothing amiss my child more than that your dear father for whom i have sought and been sighing this many a year your father lies dangerously ill in this very bed my jemmy am i then so blessed cried the boy as to see and embrace a father o my child exclaimed the old man and eagerly stretched his arms toward him come to my bosom thou only offspring of my bowels i may now say with blessed jacob let me die let me die since i have seen thy face and thou art alive my son  i would at any time give a thousand pounds my cousin for a tenth of the enjoyment that i then had in the feelings which god poured into the hearts of this little family on their so very unexpected and mavelous a meeting it appeared to me however that young james even exceeded his parents in love and this gave me such a cordial attachment to him that from that hour to this we have never been sundered he never failed nor forsook me and at this very day he is my respected friend and the superintendant of my family  john otherwise barnabas continued to linger for about a fortnight longer and then departed quite happy and without a groan during the same space also james was daily attended by my own physician and was nearly reestablished in his health  being then intent on my departure i sent for mrs tirrel mrs tirrel says i i should be much inclined to take your james along with me if i did not think you would grieve overmuch in his absence no no sir said she i would to heaven i were myself a young man for your sake i desire no better either of him or for him than that he should live and die faithfully and lovingly in your service  the next day i went down the thames in a barge partly for recreation and partly to speak to the captain of the vessel in which i proposed to embark as i drew near to the customhouse wharf i observed a wherry crowded with men whom she was about to land at the stairs and on enquiry i was informed that they were slaves whom our consul at algiers by his intercession or bounty had ransomed and sent home  immediately compassion rose powerfully in my bosom alas said i to myself i see that i am not without companions in affliction i indeed have now neither wife nor children nor father nor mother nor brother as i may say nor sister nor any connection with the world in which i live i am shut out as it were from every enjoyment upon earth let me not however be envious let me rather wish and give and dispense enjoyment to others since to give joy to others is all the joy in this world that is left to myself  here i ordered my people to land and coming up to the late captives my friends said i you are welcome once more to old england i am fond of hearing adventures you also may have got your appetites and if you will favor me with your company i will order a dinner for us at yonder tavern  i need not tell you madam that the parties were soon agreed while a plentiful dinner was providing i met alderman bicker a city magistrate and an old acquaintance of mine sir thomas said i i insist on your dining with me to day at the phaenix there perhaps your companions will not appear to you of the most honorable sort they are however good gospel guests sir thomas and consist of the halt the lame the maimed and the beggar in short i have invited all yonder ragged regiment being about five and thirty slaves from barbary to dinner and after i have filled their bellies i intend to give them a hundred pounds per man to help them to begin the world again and to keep them from being an encumbrance on their country  five and thirty hundred pounds exclaimed sir thomas bicker five and thirty hundred times twenty shillings of sterling english its well for you harry clinton that old golding was born before you but nothing can hold you long at this rate to whom again do you propose to give this unmeasurable bounty to the excrements of the public to nuisances and offenses against society to wretches whom england has spewed forth from a sick and debauched stomach but i suppose you expect to purchase extraordinary glories in heaven as the reward of these very extraordinary charities on earth no indeed sir thomas said i i shall never crave nor look for any thing at the hands of the son of david save only mercy from him and justification in him however my good friend if you will indulge me with your company you yourself shall be judge of the merit of the parties and i will wholly be guided by your advice then says he do you saunter here a few minutes while in order to open the hearts of your guests i go and give them a priming before dinner  as soon as sir thomas had executed his purpose he came forth and beckoning me to him put his mouth to my ear dont be offended says he at some free expressions that i may happen to let loose in order to encourage these fellows to the like liberty and show you what metal your companions are made of  dinner was now served up on a range of joined tables and sir thomas with an easy and cheerful familiarity desired that they would seat themselves without ceremony this many of them did with a freedom not far from impudence while others drew back abashed and begged permission to stand  at the head of the first sort was seated a fellow whose first sight gave my nerves a thrill of horror his countenance was of that cast in which any one would place an implicit confidence who wanted an associate for any dark traitorous or bloody purposes  when the cloth was removed my friend pushed the bottles about very jovially and began to talk as an utter latitudinarian in morals whereby he gained the confidence of every rogue in company  as soon as most of them were well warmed for some drank but sparingly sir thomas took out his purse and tossing a guinea to each of them now my brave friends says he if you desire any more favors you must tell me openly and honestly the jolly use you intend to make of your money to night why master answered the ill looking villain as for me and my six companions here we have had a long lent and a wench is the word that is gallantly spoken cried out sir thomas here are three guineas more apiece for you seven and now my brave friends i shall not be backward of another bounty if you will give me a short history of your adventures  that is soon done my master answered the spokesman we seven were taken prisoners by an algerine corsair after an engagement in which seven and twenty more of us lay in blood upon deck we were sold to one pedro paolo a renegade who having been of all religions in christendom had at length turned turk we were used very severely and after sweating all day were made to sweat blood at night with the stripes which they gave us however we were hardy dogs and did not matter this very much when one of their priests came privately to us and promised that if we would forsake christ and turn to mahomet he would ensure us liberty and riches here and paradise hereafter these sir as you well know were very tempting things but as soon as our master understood that we had complied with the terms he hurried us by night into one of his galleys where we were chained to the oar our ears were lopped as you see and at every meal of bread and water we received ten lashes at length his honor the ambassador i forget how they call him found us out and redeemed us and so you see us here  pray my friend said sir thomas are there any more in this company whom you could recommend to me as being of the same gallantry of spirit with yourself yes said he there are the two johns and the two andrews yonder who are none of the saint johns or saint andrews i promise you but yonder sits our saint thomas a canting son of a bitch he wanted truly to preach to us during our voyage and in the last storm he would have persuaded us forsooth to join with him in prayer here then cried sir thomas you two no saint johns and you two no saint andrews here are three pieces a man for you also and that money i hope gentlemen will be sufficient to maintain you in gaol till we can hear a better account of you ho drawer are the people i sent for in waiting they are please your honor desire them to step in  here entered a sergeant at mace with a great posse of constables sergeant said sir thomas take these seven and these four into your custody and keep them in close durance till you hear further from me i would rather open the tower cages and let all the wild beasts abroad through the streets than loose such reprobates as these among mankind  at this instant as a constable was laying hold on our gallant spokesman he suddenly drew an instrument that was half knife and half dagger and leaping across me he caught sir thomas by the throat and raising his arm would have plunged the steel into his bosom but at the same moment i seized his hand and throwing up his heels i cast him on his back and wrenched the weapon from him  as soon as we were thus rid of eleven of our guests a young man came earnestly up to us gentlemen says he till those seven hell hounds were secured i did not dare to open my mouth i know them all right well and had they known me there is not one of them but would have thrust his knife into my heart  about eleven years ago i was taken as cabin boy when they with many more were taken as sailors on board the good ship saint catharine mr william tomson master bound for the west indies as soon as we came along side the canaries this big villain patrick mc douel prevailed on most of the crew to enter into a conspiracy whereupon they barbarously and sportingly murdered the master the officers and all who were not of their own gang except myself being then about ten years of age but they did not prosper long for the very next morning we were held in chase and then they wished for the help of those hands whom they had cut off so as mc douel told you after a very bloody battle we were boarded and taken and those seven confederates were sold to one master and well as it happened for me i was sold to another and all this and more i am ready to witness in any court provided i am kept safe from the clutches of those devils  ay exclaimed sir thomas these are your charities mr clinton and such the objects of whom your judgment has made choice ah my friend i replied that charity must be very tardy which waits to be assured of the merit of its object christ himself cured ten lepers while he knew that nine of them were unworthy of his graciousness  on the entrance of the constables i had cast my eye round the room and remarked that most of our messmates seemed much alarmed and turned pale on the caption of their late comrades which rendered their characters also somewhat suspected to me wherefore lest i should cast my seed on a wholly barren soil i wished to get some further intelligence concerning them where said i is the person whom they call saint thomas i desire a few words with him  here a man approached respectfully from the farther end of the table to which through modesty he had retreated with his few companions mr thomas said i looking earnestly at him have i not seen your face before no please your honor i think that must be impossible it is now upon eighteen years since i set a foot in this kingdom and your honor must then have been but as a child do you know any thing mr thomas of these people or their affairs nothing of their affairs sir and little more of their persons than that they are all men of very profane lips except the lad who spoke to you last and my five messmates yonder the only people who during our long and dangerous voyage would return thanks to god for any of his mercies or pray him to avert his just judgments from them  then said i we will proceed between extremes on the one side we will not minister fuel to the lusts of these unhappy creatures neither will we leave them to perish or tempt them through want to robbery on the other side here landlady take this bill give twenty pounds to each of these seventeen fellows and if any of them within a month shall bring you a certificate of his good behavior give him twenty pounds more now sir thomas i may hope that i do not exceed your good pleasure not much harry not much in time you may be tractable  here the poor wretches looked amazed and scarce crediting the reality of the bounty that was ordered for them they cried thank your honors thank your honors and withdrew one of them however seemed to linger after the rest and going out last he returned again quickly and threw himself at my feet i am a reprobate sir a mere reprobate he cried and am not worthy of your charity does your conscience condemn you then said i it does sir it does then i condemn you not rise rise and give me your hand my brother  mr clinton said sir thomas now that i have kept you from casting so much money on the quicksands you can afford to be the more generous to these worthy fellows you will allow me then said i to order our landlady to pay them a hundred pounds apiece with all my heart says he and if you will be so honest as to reimburse me the sixty or seventy pieces which i threw away for your use upon the other villains i will add something to that also and divide it among them  then sir thomas if you will indulge me with your company for an hour or two longer let us send for an undertaker to put our friends here in decent apparel while we listen to what they shall be pleased to tell us of their fortunes agreed harry agreed so let us resume our seats and have the other bottle  mister thomas said i pray what may be your surname damer sir damer damer have you any relations in this kingdom alas sir i fear not my father christopher damer of essex died a little before i set out on my last voyage and had you no relation beside o sir that is it which brought the tears so suddenly into my eyes i had a sister an only sister a sister that i loved dearer than health or safety but  i fear  i fear  here his speech was stopped by his emotion while i was ready to leap up and catch him in my arms but i suppressed my inclinations for the present that i might heighten the surprise and pleasure which i foresaw there would be at the meeting of the twins  while all materials were providing from the several ware houses for the clothing and accommodation of our guests they successively gave us an abstract of their respective lives and histories wherein were many incidents extremely interesting and entertaining let us have them let us have them by all means cried lady maitland my dear madam said mr clinton were i to relate to you the several affecting stories that occurred to me throughout my travels from prisons from the depth of dungeons from captives and from persons redeemed from captivity from wretches wrecked at sea or wrecked by fortune from those who survived the calamities of warfare and famine i should never make an end  but then said the countess the poor creature who felt so sudden and affecting a compunction i have a friendship for that fellow and i am deeply interested in all the concerns of my friend i must tell you well madam you shall have his story then as nearly as i can recollect at this distance of time  chap xvi the history of a reprobate i know not gentlemen said he who my parents were i was found when an infant wrapped in rags on a coblers bulk in westminster the wardens sent me to the parish nursery for foundlings and when i was capable of instruction they sent me to the charityschool  when i had learned to read and write i was bound a servant apprentice to mr skinner a neighboring attorney my mistress grew fond of me she was a very holy woman she taught me my prayers and catechize and made me read to her every night and repeat chapters and psalms till i had nearly got half the bible by rote  as my master used to send me on many errands and messages and to entrust me with little matters of money on such occasions on finding me always punctual and honest to him he began to love me almost as much as my good mistress did  but now came on my first falling away from all goodness i was about twelve years old when in a cursed hour my master sent me to a distant part of the town with a bill to pay some money and to bring him back the change the change amounted to about four pounds in glittering silver it appeared a mint of money i had never been in possession of so large a heap and i sighed and said to myself how blessed must they be who are become the rich owners of so much money then some one seemed to whisper me that i was the owner and again some one seemed to whisper me that i was not the owner then i would go forward toward my master and again i would stop and go aside then i would thrust my hand into my pocket and feel the greatness of my treasure then turn to the wall and lay the brightness of it before my eyes then i would run a piece off as hurried away by the force of the temptation and again i would delay and stop and turn and strive to force myself homeward till what with doubting and delaying and struggling off and on and going backward and forward i considered that if i went home i should now get nothing but blame and beating and so i took a head and ran into the country as fast as my feet could carry me  as i ran myself out of breath from time to time i would look back and look back and run on and run on in the thought that my master or some one from him was at my heels but often since i have reflected and was persuaded in my mind that my kind master and mistress had not the least suspicion of me but rather enquired and sorrowed after me as being murdered or kidnapped from them and this also was at times a great grief of heart to me  when i was quite tired and jaded and night came on i turned up to a carriers inn where was written dry lodgings over the door but as i feared every thing i had the cunning to conceal my treasure and taking a penny from my pocket i begged the woman of the house for that and charitys sake to give me a little bread and milk and some hole to lie in  having finished my supper i was shown to a kind of hovel that lay under the stairs where throwing myself on some straw with a piece of a blanket over me i fell fast as a rock awakening however about midnight or somewhat after and seeing all dark about me and no creature near hand i began to tremble greatly and then i wished to say my prayers but i did not dare to pray and so i lay sweating and trembling and trembling and sweating till the dawning of the day brought some relief to my spirits  having breakfasted at the cost of a second penny i set out though not with my former speed for reflecting that i had not my livery on but a small frock coat i was under the less fear of being known however i pushed on as well as i was able wanting still to get as far from danger as possible and indeed i hoped by going on still further and further to get away from my own fears and from my own conscience  o gentlemen what misery did i not endure at that season the trust i had in my treasure began now to abate the dread of losing it also brought new troubles upon me peace was banished from within me and without there was no place whereto i might fly for rest  on the fifth morning of my travels having expended what halfpence and small silver i had i took out half a crown and offered it to the man of the house desiring him to return what was over the reckoning as he took it he gave me a look that i thought went through me and continuing to stare me in the face he shamed me so that i was constrained to turn aside he gave me the change however and i set forward on my journey all trembling and apprehending i knew not what  i had not gone above a mile when meeting a dirty road i turned over a style that led to a path through the fields here i walked on a piece when turning i saw my landlord making long strides after me whereupon my heart beat and my knees grew so weak under me that i stood as still as a stone  he came quickly up with me and seizing me by the neck he cast me on my back ha you young rogue says he let us see what money you have got then diving into my pockets he pulled out the whole stock in which i trusted for happiness o you little dog of a villain from whom have you stolen all this treasure but i must go and return it to the right owner o good sir good sir i roared out will you not leave me a little ever so little dear sir to keep me from starving but he was deaf to my cries and prayers and away he went  hope the last comfort of the miserable now forsook me i cursed at my heart the day in which i was born and i lay a long time as one who had no use for limbs nor any further way to travel upon earth at length i broke into shouts and a great gush of tears and having got some ease by venting my sorrows i rose by a kind of instinct and went on i knew not whither  growing hungry after noon i would willingly have begged the charity of passengers but this i did not dare to do for fear they should ask me whence i came and who i was and whereto i was going questions to which i could give no very honest answer so i bore my hunger as well as i could till coming over night to a hovel where a farmer kept his pigs i made way for myself among them and slept in the straw till morning  the day following as i passed slowly and half famished through a small village my eye catched at a penny loaf that lay on a little shop window which jutted into the street i looked here and there and peered into the shop and was just going to seize the ready and tempting spoil when something whispered at my heart dont touch it for your life starve starve rather than offer to steal any more and so i tore myself away and running as fast as i could for fear of turning back i at last got clear off from the reach of this temptation  when i had traveled something further i got into an enclosed country where there were hedges on every side with plenty of haws and bramble berries on every bush and here i filled my belly with berries to serve me for dinner and i stuffed my pockets with haws against i should want upon this i grew wonderful glad that i had not taken the loaf and peace again began to come upon my mind and about nightfall having reached a copse on one side of the road i crept like a hare under the shelter of the bushes i then supped upon my haws after which i kneeled down and half ventured at a prayer to god and gathering up in my form i slept happily till morning  having lived thus for some days i came into an open country where there was scarce any path nor any haw or berry within many a mile i now began to grow sick and faint with hunger and again my sickness went off and i became so greedy and ravenous that i was ready to eat my own flesh from the bones soon after i spied at a distance a confused heap of something at the root of a great tree that grew in the open fields i made up to it in expectation of i knew not what and found an old beggarman fast asleep in his patched cloak with a bundle of somewhat lying beside him  instantly i opened his little baggage when to my inexpressible transport a large luncheon of brown bread with some halfpence struck my eyes i did not hesitate a moment about seizing the bread for i could no more withstand the cravings of my appetite at the time than i could withstand a torrent rushing down a hill having appeased my stomach i began to demur about what i should do with the remainder of the bread and felt a motion or two inclining me to leave it behind me but no said i to myself this is all the bread that i have or may ever have during life and i know not where to get a bit in the whole world beside i do this man no harm in taking it away since i leave him money enough wherewith to buy more so i put the bread in my pocket and went on my way leaving behind me about four or five pence in the wrapper  i had not gone far however before i said to myself again this man is a beggar by trade and gets halfpence from every passenger that goes the road but alas no one living has any pity upon me and so to starve alive or take the money is all the question so saying or so thinking i went back on tiptoes and stooping and seizing my prey i flew away like lightening  as soon as i had got out of the reach and sight of the poor man the first motion i felt was the joy of having such a prize but i had not gone far till this joy was much abated my sighs began to heave and my tears to flow apace  that night i took up my lodging in a little waste cabin that lay a piece off the road but though as i thought i had plenty of bread and money enough about me yet i found myself exceeding heavy and i was not able to pray as i did the foregoing nights  during all this time i neither knew where i was nor whereto i was going nor any thing more of my travels than that i came from london when i had spent to my last penny and was walking slow and melancholy on a bypath that led through some woody lawns i heard the voice of merriment and quickly after perceived a group of gypsies that came from behind some trees  as i saw that i could not escape them i gathered courage and went forward when coming up they stopped and eyed me with much attention and made a ring about me where are you going my child says a man with a broad girdle and a very formidable beard indeed sir said i i cannot tell and where did you come from then from london sir so please you from london child why that is a very great way off and pray what made you leave london to get away from my master but i hope you did not come away empty you brought something from him didnt you some little matter good sir but i was robbed of it on the way hereupon this venerable regent smiled and turning to his dependents as far as i see said he this chap will answer our purposes to a hair  here one of the females asked if i was hungry and on my answer in the affirmative they all invited me with a jovial air to dinner we then turned a distance off from the path wherein we had met and gradually descended into one of the pleasantest spots in the world it was a dell surrounded with hills some of which were slanting some headlong and impending and all covered or spotted with groups of trees of different heights sorts and colors through which there descended a gurgling rivulet which having rolled over stones and pebbles grew silent in a small lake that reflected the circling objects from the vale below  immediately natures carpet was covered with a large cloth of fine damasked linen the baggage was taken from the shoulders of the bearers and before i could take note of what they were about there was spread as by art magic before my eyes the most various and sumptuous banquet i had ever beheld down instantly sunk the guests some sitting like the turks crossleggd while others lolled like the romans along side of each other  as they had traveled far that day they all eat in silence and in a short space the burden of the luggagecarriers was pretty much lightened in the mean time some arose and unladed two asses of the creels which they carried the cloth then was quickly emptied of the cold fowls and baked meats with the loins of beef and mutton and leathern jacks that contained plenty of the best wines and other liquors were set before us these again were decanted into clean japanned pitchers and a japanned cup of equal measure was given into every hand  then began mirth and jollity to flow round with the cups never did i see so pleasant so gleeful a company joke and banter without offense were bandied from every side and bursts of laughter were echoed from the answering hills  as soon as i was warmed and my heart opened by what i drank they all expressed a liking and kindness for me and requested that i would tell them my story without disguise accordingly i made an ingenuous confession of all the matters related but instead of meeting those reproofs which i expected for my wickedness they jointly began to ridicule my scruples and put to shame the little shame that i had of my evil deeds  my child said their ancient governor when you have been a sufficient time with us you will then learn what it is to be wise and to be happy you will then know that religion is nothing but hypocrisy or fashion there are thousands and ten thousands of religions upon earth all contrary and fighting the one against the other people pretend to fear god when it is the fear of the laws alone that is before their eyes god is not to be feared but to be loved my son for he is a very gracious and a bountiful god he gave the heavens in common to the birds of the air he gave the seas and rivers also in common to the fishes and he gave this whole earth in common to mankind but great people and people of power have seized it all to themselves and they have made to themselves possessions and properties by fences and enclosures and they have again enclosed those enclosures by laws of their own making whereby the poor are to be punished when they attempt to reclaim any part of the natural rights with which god had gifted them but when the poor without fear of the laws can gain any thing from the rich and the mighty who have robbed them of their rights they may surely do it with a safe and an honest conscience and now know my child that you are come among those who of all people can best defend you and make you happy we are of that sort of the poor who are above the rich and the mighty by being above the laws for they can frame no laws which are of any more force to us than the web of a spider  so spoke this formidable sage and indeed gentlemen however strange it may seem i saw the latter part of his assertion fully verified by practice i continued among this very singular and wonderful people near the space of three years during which time they initiated me into all the arts and mysteries of their manifold iniquities no fetters could hold them no prisons could contain them no bolts or locks could secure the treasures of the wealthy from them by the means of spells or certain odours as it were by enchantment all beasts became subject to them the wildest horse would stand for them the fiercest mastiffs did not dare to bay or growl at them so that all bleachgreens yards and gardens were as open to their invasion as the highway they assumed all sorts of shapes and almost all sorts of sizes they became visible and invisible known or unknown at pleasure for every different dress they had a different countenance and set of features so that their daily intimates could not know them except by appointed words or tokens and thus without violence or apparent fraud without bustle indictment or accusation on any side they overruled the government and held as it were the purses of the whole nation in their hands  you will wonder gentlemen by what policy these people could maintain their influence and depredations undetected throughout the kingdom i will account for this matter as clearly and as briefly as i can  though they never appeared by day except single or in small parties of ten or fifteen at most yet they kept their state entire by quick and constant intelligence beside their prince or principal potentate who was the person that first accosted me they had a deputy governor for every shire and in every parish they had a house of common use and common resort to the fraternity here their victuals were dressed and their provisions laid in and here also were deposited the spoils of the public which when converted into money was locked in a strong box one tenth for the use of the society on any emergence and the other nine for the benefit of the spoilers in proportion to their respective ranks and merits  before we rose from our late mentioned festival an ancient female fortune tellers chucked me under the chin and said do you know my dear where this same kind landlord lives who robbed you of your money all i know said i is that he lives in a little town at the sign of a white cross and near to a great windmill what cried one of the men my old host jerry gruff he hates that any except himself should prosper by their ingenuity i owe that fellow a fling cried another for once attempting to circumvent me in his own house well my lad says geoffry the old governor his house lies directly in the way of our circuit and for your encouragement i promise you that he shall refund you every penny of the money he took from you  the luggage being now up we set back on the field path by which i came and coming to a great road we divided into small parties who were appointed to meet at the parishhouse where we supped merrily and slept soundly for that night  we set out the next morning by dawn of day and entering soon after upon a common we saw a parcel of horses feeding without a keeper immediately three of the likeliest were taken from the rest out came scissars and other implements with phials of coloring essences and to work went many hands when in less than five minutes had the owners come up they could not have found a single mark of their own property upon them and indeed i have frequently known some of those my ingenious brotherhood so very audacious as to sell in public marker the cattle which they had stolen to the very persons from whom they were taken  as these people were never unprovided of their conveniences the horses were quickly bridled and dispatched by several emissaries several ways to summon the neighboring brotherhood on the third night to meet near the white cross with their appointed apparatus  accordingly on the evening of the night required we arrived on a little hill that stood opposite to the house of my conscientious landlord and soon after we were joined by several parties from several sides amounting to about a hundred and twenty persons with parcels of i knew not what upon asses etc  the packs were quickly opened and from thence were produced black and flame colored gowns flambeaux hoofs and horns and vizards of horrid aspect and terrific dimension in a hurry we were all fitted with our respective dresses and characters a large pasteboard coffin was covered with a white sheet and exalted upon the shoulders of four fiery devils and as night began to fall dark and heavy upon us a light was struck the flams were lighted one was put into every right hand speaking trumpets with other instruments of heartsinking sounds were put to many a mouth and we directly set out on our diabolical procession some roared like bulls others houled and bayed like dogs at a midnight moon while others yelled articulately in the catterwawling gibberish in short the sounds made such a complication of horrors as no mortal ears could abide nor mortal courage support  mean while the town took the alarm and began to be in commotion old and young quitted their houses and hurried hither and thither through the street but as we advanced they made backward and running or climbing or scrambling up hill they gathered all in a body before the windmill in the interim we pushed forward and entered the inn where neither cat nor dog nor living creature was left save goodman gruff who lay impotent of the gout in an upper chamber  while most of the company staid routing and searching the house below signior geoffry led a few of us up stairs he represented the person of lucifer whose name was impressed in flaming characters on his cap on entering the room where landlord gruff lay hark ye jerry says lucifer you sneaking thief you mean pettylarceny villain how came you to rob a child the other day of the money which he gained under my influence and encouragement i have a mind you scoundrel to strike you out of my list of innkeepers o my good lord lucifer cries gruff with a trembling voice in my conscience now i did not think that any kind of robbery would be an offense to your honor you lie you rascal you lie cries lucifer the devil is a gentleman he loves those who rob the great who have robbed the little but he hates your low spirited scoundrels who rob the widow and the fatherless and take from the little ones the little that they have why pray my lord lucifer are you a christian cries gruff a better one rascal than you or any of your tribe for though i tremble yet i believe and i tell thee jerry that i will make this generation to tremble but as i think the devil himself cannot bring them to believe  during this confabulation the whole house drawers and all was gutted as clean as a fowl for supper so without entering into any other habitation away we marched as in our former tremendous procession till coming to some standing water we halted and at a given word we altogether plunged our torches in the pool and instant night fell upon all the world  thus from day to day and year to year while i continued with this people i was witness to a variety of slights deceits impostures metamorphoses and depredations without any instance of their being brought to condign punishment one of them however within my time was detected taken imprisoned brought to the bar tried and brought in guilty and yet found means to evade justice by the most mavelous piece of stratagem that ever was  he was spied in the act of stealing a bay horse fresh suit was made he was seized and loaded with irons in the dungeon of the county gaol on the day of trial the fact was proved by incontestable witnesses and the jury without quitting the box pronounced the fatal word guilty have you any thing to say cried the judge why sentence of death should not be pronounced against you i can truly affirm exclaimed the culprit that i am as clear as the light of this matter that the beast which i took then was and to this hour is my own property and that there must be some wonderful mistake in this business wherefore my lord as i am upon life and death i trust that your charitable indulgence will order this same horse to be brought into court the horse accordingly was brought and the culprit continued now my lord be pleased to order the witnesses to say whether this be the same horse that i stole or not the same the same cried the witnesses by virtue of our oaths be so good then my lord to ask them of what age this horse was at the time that i stole him by virtue of the same oath four years old rising five now my lord if you will continue your gracious indulgence be pleased to order his mouth to be examined by some people skilled in such matters this also was done by two or three jockeys of acknowledged judgment who instantly cried out why my lord this horse is quite passed mark of mouth  hereupon every person that was present looked astonished and silence was in court for some minutes till the culprit resumed there is but one request more with which i shall trouble your lordship it is that you would be pleased to send and examine whether this same horse be a horse or a mare this lastly was done when the examiners cried out a mare my lord a mare without any question  here the surprise and amazement of the court was redoubled the jury looked down abashed the witnesses slunk away in utter shame and confusion and his lordship instantly ordered that the prisoner should be dismissed without fees and that the mare should be restored to him as his proper goods  now the whole mystery of the affair was merely this that some of the fraternity the very night before the trial had picked the lock of the stable and in the place of the horse had substituted this mare whom they found or formed to so perfect a resemblance of him that no eye could discern the smallest distinction  during my sojourn with these wretches may it please your honors i found by dear experience that between the birth and the grave there are but two sorts of happiness of which man is capable the one is that of a conscience void of giving offense the other is that of a conscience that cannot be offended i was therefore perpetually miserable because neither the one nor the other was my state for on the one hand i was conscious that i gave daily offense to god and man and on the other hand my conscience was daily offended thereby i was merry indeed though not happy when in company but ever dejected when left alone so that during my three years incorporation with this fraternity i never once lifted my heart in any appeal to god nor ventured to petition for any kind of favor from him  though these reprobates as i have intimated continued to perpetrate and to glory with a merry and satisfied conscience in their daily iniquities yet hitherto they had not proceeded to blood  on the night wherein i left them we we were overtaken and cut short of our intended rest by a sudden and violent tempest of wind and hail whereupon we took shelter in a waste barn that had belonged to the late farmer of the place  when we had struck on our tinder and lighted a candle we set together what straw and combustibles we could find in the house and had just kindled a fire when one of the company came and whispered that there was a man asleep in the far corner hereupon they took the candle and with softly and cautious steps found a pedlar stretched along with his head on a wisp of straw and his box close beside him they immediately lifted the box and brought it away in silence to the place where i was sitting on opening it with as little noise as possible they found therein a large quantity of silks linens and laces with a rich variety of hard wares and at the bottom a little padlocked chest full of english and spanish pieces of gold in all likelihood the whole amount of the labors of his life  this was a prize not to be thrown down the stream immediately all was in a kind of underbreathing bustle and whispering commotion the great question was how to possess themselves of such a prey with safety to their persons it was objected that the man might waken they were unluckily seen coming that way and it may be entering into that house the country might be alarmed and rise upon them they might be overtaken they might be seized in the very fact  at length a bold villain proposed directly to cut his throat and that then there could be no witness to testify against them but to this it was again objected that the blood itself would be the fearfullest and surest of all witnesses whereupon another proposed to suffocate or strangle him and bury his corpse on the spot to which scheme though many were silent yet no one expressly excepted  during this deadly consultation notwithstanding my long course of evil habit and evil example my blood curdled throughout my body and fear horror and detestation arose in my bosom but when they went as i supposed to put the deed of death into instant execution i crouched and shrunk inward and creeping out at the door the dread of being also seized and murdered gave me strength to get on my feet and feeling along by the wall i got away from the house and made off i neither knew nor cared where or whereto  the tempest still continued the driving of the clouds added to the natural horrors of night i could scarcely discern that i had a road under my foot but though i could not see my pursuers i yet feared that their eyes were better than mine and i still turned and listened to try if the foot of the murderer was behind me  having traveled all night as fast and far as i could from the scene of my terrors on the rising of the day i saw a large town before me and for the first time of three years i lifted up my eyes and inwardly blessed god for his mercy in my escape from so great a wickedness thereupon i felt a pleasure that i had never felt before and i said in my heart if you will once more be my god i will be your true servant and will never offend or transgress any more  i then walked on leisurely and my fatigue went from me and i seemed quite lightsome to myself on entering the suburbs i met a gentleman taking his mornings walk out of town i stopped and looked him wistfully in the face whereupon he also stopped and eyed me with much attention who are you my pretty lad says he an unhappy stranger sir who wants a service or any means of earning a little honest bread and pray what service can you do not much sir i fear but my good will shall strive hard to make up my lack of ability then cried he you shall be my servant all the servants i ever had promised every thing but did little i will now try what may be done by one who promises nothing what is your name my boy david doubtful sir for that was my true name though i had gone by several others and what wages must i give you david just as much sir or as little as you shall please to think i deserve  here he took me to a handsome house where he kept a mercers shop in plymouth his name was felton he had been a widower of some years and had an only son who was then at westminster school in london  my master at first set me to the most servile and vile offices such as cleaning his and the servants shoes sweeping the street before his door and carrying out the dirt of the house but all this i did with willingness and even with pleasure as some little matter of penance for my long course of evil deeds  on my separating from my brethren in iniquity as i have told you i was the proprietor of one hundred and seventy odd pounds which was locked up in the parish chest being my allotted dividend of the fruits of our common knavery for three successive years but in my present turn of mind i would no more have accepted any part thereof than i would have taken a bar of red hot iron into my hand i had also in my pocket a few crowns with some smaller silver but these i secretly distributed among the poor that no part as it were of achans accursed thing might remain about me  in about three weeks my master again changed the whole manner of my service and set me to brush his clothes dress his wigs whet the knives lay the cloth and attend at table but these were matters in which i was quite expert as i had not yet forgotten my employment with my first master  in some time after mr felton asked me if i could read a little in the bible sir said i and can you write too david if you please i will try sir why david this beats the hand of my clerk where in the world did you come by all this learning from a very good master to a very bad servant but pray sir do not enquire the particulars of my naughtiness for indeed you could not desire a severer monitor than my own conscience is to me well my child said the good man i will not put you to pain and so giving me a squeeze by the hand he went out with a glistening eye  from this time my master showed an uncommon respect and attention to me he discharged me from all the menial offices of his household he gave me his burdens of silks and other wares to carry to his several customers and he desired me to take particular notice of the nature and values of what i carried  on this encouragement i became vastly more apprehensive and assiduous than he looked for i attended the shop closely and took notice and private notes of all that was estimated or transacted therein my master looked quite amazed on asking me some questions with respect to his affairs his eldest prentice soon after set up for himself he then placed me behind the counter over his younger apprentice and in joint authority with his journeyman and soon after he gave me the key of his till and the trust of all his treasure i now dined with him at the same table and consulted and conversed with him as his friend and companion he gave me frequent pocketmoney which he told me he would not charge to the account of my wages i walked with him every evening went to church with him every sunday and read to him in the bible every night i was now wholly reconciled to my god and felt him in my soul as a friend and benefactor pleasure played about my heart peace lay under my pillow and my happiness seemed as a ship that after a long and desperate voyage had anchored in a calm and secure haven  i had now been something upward of a year in the service of mr felton when one day i heard a bustling noise in the street and saw people running hither and thither across the window i stepped to the door and looking to the left saw a great crowd about a cart wherein were five criminals going to execution i staid till they came just opposite to me when to my utter astonishment and terror i i saw five of my old acquaintance and in the front of them the bloody villain who had proposed cutting the throat of the unfortunate pedlar instantly i turned all pale as my shirt and dreading that they would know and claim acquaintance with me i shrunk in and running backward threw myself half fainting into a chair  i now reflected that it was happy for me that no one was in the shop to take note of my confusion and endeavoring to assume some courage on the entrance of our journeyman i put on the most unconcerned appearance that i could  mr felton happened to dine abroad that day and did not return till the cloth was laid for supper he took his chair at table and desired me to sit beside him david said he is it not wonderful that people should continue so incredulous notwithstanding the frequent and daily proofs of an allseeing and an alldetecting providence if a sparrow falls not to the ground without the notice of our god how much more will he take account of the life of him whom he formed in his own image the villain trusts to hide his villainy and dares to affirm with the first murderer in the face of god and of man i know not where is my brother but blood has a voice a crying voice david it cries aloud to heaven from the very bowels of the earth no depth can cover it no darkness can conceal it for the light that shines in darkness will bring it forth to the day  about twelve months ago a pedlar or itinerant merchant was murdered in a waste house called fieldings barn the murderers were of the people whom they call gypsies the most subtle and evasive of all sorts of reprobates so that the fact lay a long time in silence this pedlar as it seems had an only brother to whom the reversion of his substance belonged and this brother not seeing or hearing from him of a long time went throughout the whole country and through many parts of the kingdom enquiring after him at length he arrived over night at an inn some miles from hence where he found in the kitchen seven men jovially seated over a bowl of punch he quickly accepted their invitation and having spent the time pleasantly and the house being throng he and one of the company were shown to the same bed  about midnight his companion began to moan most piteously when jogging and asking him why he groaned o fieldings barn he cried fieldings barn fieldings barn again lying still awhile he started and cried you cannot say it you cannot say that my hand was in the murder again he would mutter with a half smothered voice see see how he struggles see how he kicks put put him out of pain o put him out of pain  hereupon the brother rose and dressed as quietly as possible and making way to the next magistrate he returned and seized and carried off his bedfellow before any of his comrades were apprized of the matter  what have you done you villain said the magistrate without preface what have you done with the body of the pedlar whom you murdered in fieldings barn on this question the wretch thinking that all was detected instantly fell on his knees i had neither hand nor heart in the murder sir he cried and if you will get me a pardon i will faithfully tell you the whole affair on his confession the five principal rogues were arrested before they were out of bed and on his evidence and that of their seventh companion they were sentenced and this day executed and are to be gibbeted in the morning  during this narration i could not refrain from expressing by my countenance and gesture the strong compunction i felt on recollecting my long association with those reprobates but my good master as i suppose ascribed my emotions merely to the detestation which i had of their deeds  i had been close upon two years in the service of mr felton and he had lately agreed with me at    l yearly whereof he paid me the last years wages in hand when one evening as i stood behind the counter a young woman came in and desired to see such and such goods while she was cheapening on the one hand and i setting forth the extraordinary value on the other several intelligent glances were exchanged between us whenever her eyes met mine she instantly cast them down with a blushing modesty and yet whenever i looked at her i saw that her eyes had been fixed upon me at length having bought some little matters she made me a bashful courtesy and going out at the door she turned upon me with a significant glance and departed  all that night i felt myself as i had never felt before i turned and turned again from the image of this girl and yet she seemed to stand before me and to look and to look upon me as she had done the day before  for five tedious days she witheld herself from my sight and i feared that i should never behold her any more at length she came and i strove in vain to conceal my joy on her appearance after cheapening and paying for some little matters she cast her eye on a piece of silk which she said she fancied greatly but feared that her pocket would not reach so far o miss said i we shall not quarrel for such a matter provided i know where to call for the money on sarah simper sir said she at such a sign in such a row  as i had three or four spare hours from business every evening i gladly laid hold of the occasion i had gotten for spending that time in visits to my beloved i went indeed without forming any purpose or intention save the pleasure of seeing her her fondness seemed at least to equal my own and though we proceeded at times to toying and dallying yet for three weeks we kept within warrantable limits but this was not always the case our first transgression was succeeded on her part by tears and reproaches and on mine by a depth of sorrow and remorse  as this was my first fault with respect to woman my conscience was yet unsteeled i spent the night in sighs and tears of contrition and i repeated a thousand promises and vows to my god that i never would be guilty of the like again  for five entire days i kept from going to her at length i considered that as i had injured her i ought to make her such recompense as was in my power i put about twelve pounds into my pocket being all that i had left of my last years salary and went and told her that i was come to take my leave of her then pouring the money into her i ap i promised to give her what i should earn from time to time and to marry her whenever i should be enabled to maintain a family here we both fell into tears and from tears we proceeded to caresses and so forth till at last we became as guilty as we had been before  in like manner for the six ensuing weeks i kept on in a course of repenting and sinning and of sinning and again repenting every night i formed resolutions which i imagined would be stronger than any i had made before but whatever force i put on myself whatever strength i exerted i never was able to persevere for three days together when i felt myself drawn to her as by some irresistible chordage i vowed and flattered myself on the way that i would return without transgressing but when i came to her i found it quite as impossible to keep from sinning with her as it was to keep from her thus by frail and falsified vows i daily continued to add to the heap of my guilt till at length i became hopeless of any ability to resist temptation and sinned on with my eyes open and yet with less remorse than before  as i was sitting with her one evening a bailiff entered suddenly and laid an action upon her for fifteen pounds which he said she promised to pay for her mother in her last illness whether the debt was feigned and the caption preconcerted between them i know not but i afterward recollected that she did not seem to be so alarmed as one would have expected on such an occasion on the other hand my soul was filled with bitter and distracting thoughts i could not think of suffering my love to be confined among fellows in a common prison and yet how to come by the money i knew not  offered the man my note payable when my salary should be due but he refused to depart without instant payment hereupon i hurried home and taking out    l of my masters money i returned and discharged the action  from this time my fair one began to extend her appetites and to rise in her passions under color of being with child her longings and fits came frequent upon her and i was in a manner constrained to indulge her till i had taken of my masters money to the amount of fisty pounds  david said she one day it is time to tell you that i must soon quit my mantuamaking business for i am growing too big to appear with decency among my customers so you must take other lodgings for me and provide a sufficient fund to defray the many necessary expenses of childbirth and where my dearest sally may such a fund be provided i have already gone lengths for you that may bring me to the gallows if you had not been a poor spirited fellow says she you could not bear to live in the fears that haunt you so you would long since have made away with that old scoundrel your master here throw this little dust into his broth or his posset and then you may wallow in money without fear of account  here i looked her full in the face when every beauty that had once enchanted me suddenly vanished from my sight and i saw nothing but the dire head of a sneaky medusa however i suppressed my horror as well as i could and putting back the paper no no no no sally said i i would rather die the worst of deaths myself than have a hand in making away with my kind old master and die you shall then she cried for i will not perish alone she then dropped on her knees and vowed with fearful imprecations that she would go directly to mr felton and make a discovery of my robberies that she would also go to the next magistrate and swear a rape against me and that she would poison herself and the bastard within her that she might not bring into the world any part of such a villain  while she spoke her aspect looked livid and deadly and wrath and desperation flashed in fire from her eyes  my dear sally said i lower your passions a little give me that paper again we shall see what may be done and here i leave you my watch as a pledge of my return by to morrow at noon this i did however not with the smallest intention of keeping my promise for i determined never more to look her in the face but i bequeathed to her as it were the only stake of value which remained to me that the wretch whom i had ruined might not be left altogether without means of life  when i got into the street i hastened homeward without deliberating a moment on what i was about or on the consequences that might ensue my master was in a back chamber looking over some letters when i rushed in precipitately and shut the door behind me what is the matter child says he are you not well you look pale and affrighted what is the matter david o sir o sir and i sunk upon my knees i bring to you a villain a reprobate a thief a robber a betrayer of trusts also the vilest sinner that ever sinned against god and against man i got in league with a bad woman who seduced me by her beauty and then prevailed upon me to defraud and rob you and would have persuaded me to murder you but there i stopped short i could not be prevailed upon to murder you my master pray then said he somewhat sternly to what intent are you come to demand justice sir i cried and to appease my own conscience by suffering for my faults tell me then said he mildly and tell me truly of how much money have you defrauded me of fifty pounds sir i answered a few shillings under or over rise then pray rise my david he cried i would not bring you to shame and much less to punishment for five times the value of fifty pounds i owe you for your services very nearly that sum and i forgive you the remainder with all my heart no sir i cried aloud and burst into tears you do not forgive me you cannot forgive me for this your goodness does but heap the heavier guilt upon my soul  he then got up and came to me and raising me to his bosom he embraced me and cried i rejoice over thee my david i rejoice over thee my child as heaven rejoiceth over the one sinner that repents more than over the ninety and nine that have no need of repentance you now know your own frailties you are sensible of your lapses you will be cautious of future falls and you stand upon firmer ground than ever  you know me not i exclaimed you know me not my good master i am wholly irreclaimable the devil has taken possession of me and reigns through all my members i find it quite in vain to strive or struggle against him i have no more strength than a midge against temptation no more power than a weak and fainting man against a torrent that already has borne him far away  i will pray for you my son said the good man vehemently i will wrestle with my god for you and his grace shall be sufficient no sir i replied after that which has happened i never shall be able to look you in the face i will not trust myself i know that i should fall on the first trial will you leave me then he cried will you leave me my son david and he took out his handkerchief and wiped away the falling tear i must i answered i must leave you my dearest master i should be miserable if i staid i will go directly to sea i will confine myself in some ship where i shall be shut from any commerce or communication with mankind and not have it within my reach to wrong or damage any person and indeed i could not bear to stay in one town or even in one kingdom with that bad woman where may she be found david said mr felton ah sir i exclaimed leave her to god and to her own evil conscience i beseech you i believe she is with child by me do not desire my master to hurt a little innocent that has not yet seen the light no my david no i mean nothing but comfort to her i mean to supply her wants and to soften her distresses she will not then be tempted to wish hurt to her benefactor and i will take care of the little wretch which she carries in her body for your sake my david  there was something so affecting gentlemen in such a proof of wonderful goodness as must have struck to the heart of the most abandoned reprobate i was quite overcome thereby i fell suddenly at his feet and i wished to pour out my very soul in the same manner as i poured my tears upon them  as he now found that i was bent and determined on departing david says he since you will go you must not go unprovided a sailor ought to have with him his chest and cheques and jackets with his books and instruments of navigation and so forth and if you will give me your company for three or four days longer i will look out to procure you some little matter of station and get you a good birth in some ship or other mean time i would advise you to set about your preparations for which purpose you must accept these fifty guineas which you may please to return me when some happy adventure shall furnish you with means no no sir i cried putting his purse back with my hand your plan is not the plan of your reprobate servant your good stations and good births are not at all for my purpose i will go as a common sailor the meanest offices and the greatest drudgery will be a penance too little much too little for my transgressions and so saying i turned and went hastily out  i made directly to the quay where i saw a crowd of citizens intermixed with sailors on going up i found that they were enlisting volunteers to whom they offered from one to three guineas per man and what will you give me captain if i go with you he then looked earnestly at me and having eyed me several times from head to foot i will give you my lad said he five guineas in your fist the best mess of pottage the snuggest hammoc to lie in and here is my hand for a hearty welcome into the bargain if your honor then will be pleased to order those five pieces to be laid out for me in cheques and trowsers and such necessaries as you think fitting i live at such a place and shall be ready at a call enough said the captain our ship is a thirty gun called the centurion and your friend david jenkins the commander of her we set out by mornings tide between ten and eleven and if you come without a call you will be the more welcome so saying he gave me a familiar shake by the hand and we parted  i then went directly home and calling mr pelton aside i told him of my success and engagement in the centurion suppressing only the time of my early departure for i felt that i could not stand the parting with him and i thought it best to make it as little painful to him and myself as might be  during supper i endeavored to chat but i could not and as mr felton at times looked affectionately upon me i turned my head aside and a silent tear stole down my cheek  i spent the night in sighs and tears and getting up before day i took my shoes in my hand and stepping softly down stairs would have stolen out at the street door but in that instant the door of a side parlour was opened and before i could look about my master had me in his arms will you leave me then david will you indeed leave me he cried o david david i love you next to my only child stay with me yet my son o stay with me my david and i will do every thing i will do all things that may be done for you  here i sunk and was just fainting under the pressure of his goodness do not kill me my master do not kill me outright i cried you must no longer be burdened by my body of sin and death as god has forsaken me i must leave you my master let him do with me as he will and if i perish i perish so saying i broke from him and away i rushed weeping and sobbing all the way as though my heart would cleave in sunder  the captain received me with great cordiality and at times called me his namesake and was very familiar with me the sailors also after his example began to affect me without any appearance of envy for though i had not been exercised in their profession yet i was strong and hale and active and ready to assist them at every turn  in the mean time please your honors it may appear very extraordinary that though i felt daily compunction and nightly wept many tears for having offended my god throughout the course of my life yet i neither prayed to him nor besought pardon from him nor applied to him for any kind of support or assistance  i was now incorporated with a fraternity whose wickedness was of a species quite different from that of my former brotherhood our sailors were so far from cheating or defrauding that they scarce seemed to have any regard for property and they were as brave a set of fellows as ever trod a deck but then they were as hardened to any sense of religion or piety as the nether millstone and the sacred and tremendous names of god and his christ were of no other import to them than as the balls of a billiard table to be tossed and stricken and bandied about for sport  at first this was a matter of great offense and horror to me can there be a god i would say to myself and can he suffer his tremendous name to be insulted and blaspherned as it is by these wretches but alas i was not as one of the three captives at babylon i could not be cast into the furnace and come forth without a singe in time this profaneness became less irksome to my ears and by degrees i began to relish and to catch the common contagion  at times however some thoughts of god and a savior would come into my mind and the pious impressions of my infancy would return upon me but i did my best to banish them as they served but to torment me  at times again i would silently expostulate as it were with god it is true i would say to him i have been wicked desperately wicked through a long course of sinning but did i not long strive and struggle and fight against temptation if you meant me for yourself why did you not make me with less proneness to evil or why did you not give me greater strength to resist  again shocking and blasphemous thoughts would enter into my gloomy soul as though the gospel were all a fable and religion nothing but priestcraft that all events were of chance that men were good or evil merely according to constitution and that either there was no god or he was too great or too distant to concern himself with the insignificant affairs of mortals but these infusions of the tempter were never of long continuance and again i would return to believing and trembling  our ship had been destinated to protect the trade in the levant within the space of five months we had rescued from their captors six vessels of english built and english property and we had made prize from time to time of three stout frigates of those african pirates who war upon the world when the boy from the mast head cried out a sail we immediately made chase and found by evening that we had gained considerably upon her but as the night came on thick and hazy we slackened our course and in a manner lay by till morning but hung out no lights  at dawn of day we renewed the chase though no sail was then in sight but we had not continued our course above four or five leagues when we clearly discerned the said vessel and perceived that she had tacked about and was bearing down toward us  hereupon we slacked our sails and waited for her but we had not waited long till we perceived a second vessel that seemed in chase of the first and some time after saw a third that seemed in chase of the two former  on this the mate an old and experienced sailor looked somewhat blank and desired that the captain would instantly call a council of war gentlemen says he the many captures we have lately made could not fail of informing our enemies that we are in these seas and i apprehend with great reason that they have made choice of their best means to overreach and overmatch us and to fall with their united forces upon us and indeed ye may already perceive that the ship which we had in chase has slackened her sails and waits to be joined by her two consorts whom she seemed so lately to fear i think as the jockeys say that we have more than foot for them and all the question is whether old england shall make use of her feet to fly while she has any hands left wherewith she may fight at this they cried with one voice no flying no flying let them come on the circumcised dogs as many as may be of them we will neither take nor give quarter they or we must to the bottom to work then my brave lads cries captain jenkins for we are likely to have as warm a bout on it as we could wish  to bustle went all hands every sail was fitted the ropes and pullies were made pliable and for the first time we interlaced and bedded our nettings the captain then ordered all the small arms to be gathered and cleaned and loaded and laid upon deck and choosing from the company a dozen of the best marksmen he disposed them round the ship under the shelter of the gunnel with orders to bring down every enemy who mounted any shroud within the reach of a musket ball  our ship at this time was full manned with about two hundred and seventy spirits all as ready and desirous to go and meet death as a beau to go to a ball or an alderman to a festival  the three consorts were now joined as our mate had foreseen and came down in full sail and a sweeping course upon us and then it was that my sins came crowding into my mind and i believe i was the only person of the ships company who trembled  they all came up with a desperate boldness and while one attacked us in front the others run along side almost close to our gunnel and expecting instantly to sink us poured the thunder of their cannon on either side upon our timber while we raked the ship astern with our chase guns and showerd upon them on either side the burning hail of our small arms this put them into some confusion and they sheered off a little space when in our turn we saluted them with a broadside on either hand which went over the heads of their men but much damaged their rigging to repair this they ran up the shrowds as thick as bees upon a branch but our marksmen brought them down in a shower upon their decks and as we plentifully supplied them with newloaded arms in a short time there was not a man to be seen among their sails  our ship was of english oak and stood their shot to a wonder our metal was also much weightier than theirs but then they outnumberd us three to one in men and in guns  having got out of the reach of our small shot they moved off as intending to make their escape but having repaired their tackle as well as time would allow they returned upon us with twofold resolution and fury  then it was gentlemen that such a scene was opened as was sufficient to strike hell itself with horror  they now entertained us with a new kind of warfare for getting up within pistol shot they tossed their grenadoes or hand shells among us that were filled with broken bottles and with rusty and ragged pieces of old iron these did fearful execution and our deck was quickly covered with blood and brains and pieces of human flesh while the noise of the cannon could scarcely drown the screams of the wounded and the groans of the dying  all enraged and desperate we now tore away the beds and netting that confined their shells to our deck and heaving them overboard we lowered the level of our cannon and poured our grapeshot into the midst of their ships on either side which made horrible havoc and uproar among them whereupon two of them sheered away as fast as their tattered cordage would permit while the third kept playing upon us at a distance  we now had leisure to clear our deck and with sorrowful hearts threw our dead and our dying companions overboard as also all whom we judged to be past recovery among our wounded was one daniel mc daniel who had lost his right hand by the bursting of a shell and while we meant to spare him heave me over heave me over my lads he gallantly cried since i no longer can help you let me not be your hindrance no daniel no i cried you shall not be heaved off such a heart with a left hand may be better to us one day than the two hands of a goliath  having once more set all to rights we moved toward the vessel that continued to annoy us whereupon she veered away and joined her consorts we then bore down on all three but they gave way before us and maintained a running fight and as they levelled their shot almost wholly at our rigging by evening we were incapable of further pursuit for we had scarce a yard of entire shrowding left and our sails fluttered in the wind and fell along by their masts  mean while we had plied them with our cannon as fast as we could load and as it began to wax duskish we perceived the crew of the hindmost in much confusion and they repeated the signals of distress to their consorts soon after we saw them heave out their boat and they had scarce crowded in and moved off a piece when their ship sunk outright and went plum to the bottom hereon we gave a great shout which we repeated on seeing their boat overset but as the moors are excellent swimmers i suppose most of them got safe and were taken in by their companions in the mean space our brave daniel mc daniel was put out of pain by a grapeshot in the temple and our most gallant captain jenkins had his right leg carried off half way up his thigh by a cannon bullet i think it was the last shot the enemy fired  as i stood by my captains side i catched him in my arms before he fell to the board and cried out for the surgeons but the effusion of blood was so great and so impossible to be stanched that we quickly despaired of any life for him  as i supported him on deck with my right arm he found himself growing faint and turned his face to me david said he i am not afraid to die for i am a christian i believe as surely as i am here that christ came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief and he is so great and so gracious that he will not suffer hell or the grave to disappoint him of an end for which he paid so dear a price here my david here is my purse and my watch which i bequeath to your love as my last legacy and here is my diamond ring with which i entrust you as a token to my dear daughter if ever it shall be your fortune to revisit old england and if you should go to london my dear david enquire out my good old friend alderman bicker tell him of my behavior during your service with me and that i beseech him to use his interest with our protector in procuring my pay for my poor sweet child  and that i will right heartily cried out sir thomas i will also speak a word for yourself my lad the protector cannot refuse his favor to one who has had the honor of serving in the action of the centurion whose fame our very enemies have spread through europe but pray proceed in your narration i long to hear of the event and of your future successes  though we greatly grieved for our captain we were still more concerned for the honor of england lest our good ship should fall into the hands of the barbarians for she now lay like a hulk on the face of the water she could neither pursue nor avoid an enemy and though she had been in plight we had not hands left sufficient to work her  night came on apace hostilities ceased on both sides the pirates hung out lights to prevent as we supposed their parting from each other and we mournfully called a muster of our men in the dark whereon we found that of two hundred and seventy odd men we had but fifty remaining twenty of whom were wounded though not disabled  come my lads cried the old mate it is as good to be merry as sad we have wrought enough to day to give us an appetite let us have a piece of pork and a bowl of punch and if we die by morning let us not die with cold hearts and empty stomachs moreover for your encouragement i take upon me to promise that if you will be guided i will make you the masters of one of yonder vessels before sunrise  we engaged compliance to a tittle and after supper and a plentiful draught he ordered our boats to be heaved overboard and let drive with the wind we then set our watch and went down to take a few hours repose  two hours before day we were roused by our mate and the first thing we did was to bore a large hole in the side of our ship about a foot below water for which we had an occasional plug prepared  as soon as the day dawned we set watches at the cabin windows to give us timely notice of the enemys approach and we lay down on our small arms withinside the gunnel quite out of observation  the pirates as we presumed held up their glasses but seeing neither men nor boats in our ship they concluded that we had made an elopement by night and came on without precaution or preparation  as soon as they had arrived within about half a league our watchmen according to order drew forth the plug and getting up stairs crouched down and joined us  the consorts had agreed to board our ship on each side in confidence of a rich and unresisting prize but the moment that we heard the first of them rustling alongside and perceived that they were beginning to ascend our gunnel we jumped up as one man and setting up a great shout and overturning all we met leaped into their vessel  never was amazement like that of the enemy they scarce made any resistance and in less than a minute not a moor was left upon deck  mean time the other pirate had boarded our late vessel and nearly all the crew had now got upon deck they had heared indeed the shout with the clamor and groans of their fellows but did not rightly know what to make of it till moving close round the head of our former ship we shot the few who were left in the second frigate then throwing out our grapplings we towed her a piece off and then bored and sunk her in the face of her owners  they thereupon set up such a yell of despair and horror as was affecting even to the hearts of their enemies at length they turned the cannon of the centurion upon us but every moment we got further and further from their shot till having reached to a distance of about three leagues we saw our good centurion go to the bottom the glorious tomb of her noble captain who had fought her to the last  we now thought that of about a thousand assailants there was not one left to carry tidings to their native country of their defeat but going down to the statecabin i saw a young man richly dressed and of a noble aspect leaning wounded upon a couch with three attendants about him  as i entered he gave me a look that seemed compounded of apprehension and courage and accosted me in mixed english for he had traveled much and resided for a season in london  i know said he that i am your prisoner i also know what i am to expect draw your cutlass then and let me join my countrymen no sir i replied you have nothing to fear from me a man who deserves that name owes nothing but love to man except when he is assaulted the brave see no enemy in the feeble or the conquered  where have you learned he cried the sentiments of my own soul but your generosity shall lose you nothing demand what ransom you please and it shall be paid you i am not commander in chief i answered but as far as my influence reaches you are free as air and shall be bound to us by nothing but your affections then stretching forth his arm your hand my brother he cried and giving me a kind squeeze the tear came into his eye  i went directly on deck and informed our little crew now reduced to thirty three of what had passed between the noble moor and myself and told them i hoped they would be so generous as to make my promise good to this the greater number gladly assented but some of them murmured hereupon i remonstrated that we were already rich enough for we had taken all the plate and money with what was most valuable and portable out of our own ship beside the treasure in the pirate frigate which we had not yet divided i further represented that we knew not what the events of war or fortune might be and that it would not be imprudent to make a friend on the african coast who in all appearance was a person of high consideration and with these reasons at length all appeared to be satisfied  i then carried the pleasing tidings to my new friend and took with me our only surviving surgeon who dressed the wound in his thigh which had been made by a musket ball  as soon as the surgeon had withdrawn the noble osmyn of petra for so he was called presented me with his purse and a carbuncle ring of extraordinary value and pressed them earnestly upon me but i as peremptorily refused them and this refusal appeared to distress him greatly  during the five days in which we continued together i had him as tenderly and as honorably attended as our circumstances would admit and i spent with him all the time i could spare from my duties and great fatigues upon deck as all the hands we had were kept busily employed in splicing the ropes refitting the mangled sails and rigging and in repairing the breaches of the vessel for our cannon had bored her sides quite through in several places  on these accounts we sailed but heavily still making toward the straits and daily wishing to meet or be overtaken by some english ship of force to which we might safely confide ourselves and our treasures  on the sixth morning having arrived within twenty leagues of the mouth the day discovered to us that we were almost within shot of a ship of english built and that carried english colors hereat we rejoiced with exceeding great joy and slackening our sail and heaving out a small boat ten of us slipped into it and away we rowed with all our might as we approached we saw numbers in english dresses walking to and again on deck and getting alongside they threw ropes over to us and we mounted with great alacrity  hitherto we were so intoxicated with joy that we had not the precaution to hail them till we found ourselves in the very thick of our enemies i looked round and seeing none but tawny and hostile faces about me i civilly demanded who and of what country they were when a ruffian gathering his spittle spirted it full in my face and at the same time gave me a buffet on the side of my cheek then i did not once reflect either where or among whom i was but with one stroke of my fist i stretched him stiff along the deck then throwing up the heels of another who had raised his arm against me he fell with his head foremost across his fellow and twisting round on a third who had seized me behind by the shoulder i dragged him under me and we fell together upon the board here a crowd of them gathered over me and each helping to hold a leg or an arm i was bound with cords that crushed my flesh to the very bone and then tumbled with kicks like a dog along the deck  mean time my nine companions who had offered to interpose were also seized and bound and cast into the hold  for about three hours i lay in excessive anguish though through a sort of stubborn pride i endeavored to suppress my groans in the interim i felt the ship begin to move and soon after i perceived all in bustle about me for i could see nothing that happened withoutside the gunnel again i heared from within and without several discharges of small arms and as i saw several moors fall lifeless or convulsed and biting the deck around me i rightly concluded that the ships were engaged i gave a long and deep groan and i cried aloud o my countrymen my brave countrymen why am i not with you why have i not the happiness of dying with you and for you and my heart was so wrung that i fainted quite away  i afterward learned that my true and valiant fellows had refused to submit upon summons that the pirate seeing them so few and being desirous of saving the frigate for their own use had attacked them with small arms which were warmly answered on our part when having dropped or disabled above half of our brave english with two of osmyns attendants who happened to be upon deck they entered and mercilessly butchered the remainder among whom was our old mate and surgeon  mean space i lay insensible to all that passed till a ruffian seeing me pale and lifeless in all appearance gave me a wring by the nose hereupon i awaked to the bitterest sensations i remembered me of my gallant messmates who had so loved and caressed me above my merits and my tears without sigh or groan went in a river down my cheeks  at length i heared a voice a known voice as i thought crying where is my friend where is my brother david and turning my head a little i saw my noble osmyn just entering the ship  o gentlemen be not apt to judge hardly of all who have not learned christ by the form and by the letter osmyn my osmyn proves that he may be in the heart of those who never acknowledged his name although they have felt his power and indeed as the apostle writes those who never learned his law yet having his law or rather himself in their hearts shall be justified  having instantly cast an eye of searching love around he spied where i lay and coming and throwing himself beside me he put one arm about me and cried o my brother my brother david is it thus that my people use you i grieve that you christians should beat us all to nothing in honor and humanity he then took out his knife and having tenderly cut my cords he strained his own ability to help me to rise  he then called for the captain who came bowing to him with great respect their discourse was long and earnest at length osmyn rose high in passion and gave the captain a back stroke with his hand across the face i observed his choler swelling almost to suffocation but he suppressed his indignation and retired in silence i heard osmyn then giving some orders to the men but as i was a stranger to their language i knew not the purport of any thing that passed soon after however i saw my nine companions brought from the hold and unbound and osmyn turning to me desired me to tell my people that they were all free and that as soon as we landed in barbary he would take the first means of sending them with honor to their native country ah my lord i cried i am sorry that you struck the captain he has many adherents here and will certainly seek some method of revenge he dare not he dare not replied my friend the villain would have disputed with me the property of my own frigate which i manned and fitted out at my own expense but if i hear or see any more of his insolence as soon as we land i will complain to the dey my uncle and have the rogue impaled alive  he then ordered out the long boat and turning to me said i am going david to take an account of what effects are left in my ship and i would take you with me if you were in a condition to go but i will soon return and in the mean time order the surgeon to do his best for allaying the swelling in your limbs  during his absence the ships company and even the captain whose name was barbar behaved themselves toward me and my fellows with great though silent civility and a plentiful mess was served up to us for dinner but during our repast i observed that the captain called such and such of his men to the quarter deck where he held with them a long and whispering kind of conversation  these fellows as it seems were the most barbarous and bloody of all their barbarous and bloody countrymen having taken the ship wherein we then were a merchantman carrying about twenty guns they had massacred every creature on board and then dressed themselves in the clothes of the english in order to inveigle others into the like calamity while they dispatched their own frigate back to tunis to get recruits  my noble friend did not return till late in the evening he then ordered supper to be got ready and the statecabin to be prepared for him and i to lie in but i whispered and besought him to excuse me for declining that honor as i perceived that the favors which he did me had already given much umbrage and offense to his countrymen  i know not whence or for what purpose forebodings may come but all that night my spirits were exceedingly sad and depressed and though my fellows and i were put to lie in a part of the ship the most remote from my friend yet i imagined that i heard secret treadings and mutterings and again at dead of night that i heard the distant sound of trampling and struggling as of people in doing and receiving violence  i was still sore from the tyings and the bruises which i had received when toward the end of a sleepless night a gang of armed ruffians entered the place where we lay and loaded us with irons they then took away all our clothes and treasures and threw to each of us a canvas shirt and drawers as slaves prepared for the market  the moment they laid their hands upon me it occured that they would not have dared to do it if they had not first made away with my dear friend and patron at which thought my soul grew instantly sick and a dark cloud of sorrow fell heavily upon it  sore and shackled as i was i got immediately on deck and looked wistfully out to sea but could discover no frigate i then shuffled along as fast as i could to the cabin where i had parted the night before with my osmyn and looking in at the door i cried aloud where are you lord osmyn where are you my master my friend my dear osmyn where are you where are you  when no answer could be had i returned wild with rage and grief and notwithstanding my chains had i not been disabled by my contusions i should have done my best to throttle every man i met but all i could do was to wring my hands and roar aloud to all around yet butchers ye cutthroats ye villains of all villains what have ye done with your lord what have ye done with your master what have ye done with my friend with my osmyn my osmyn  for two nights and two days i tasted nothing but water which i drank in large quantities as my soul as well as body was in a ferment and a fever on the third day the captain fearing that i would die of grief and that he should lose what he proposed to get by my sale sent a kind of interpreter to me to let me know that on the night in which i parted with osymn he and the captain soon after had some warm words concerning their rights in the frigate and in the english now on board whereupon osmyn swore that he would not remain any longer in his ship and that taking with him a number of hands he reimbarked in the frigate and directly set sail  as this tale carried with it some face of a fact i grew easier in my mind and on the very day following having anchored in the bay of algiers my fellows and i were taken into the town and sold at public market  i happened to be bought by one of the deys factors who immediately sent me to the work at his country palace  this work was a most stupendous undertaking above five hundred men had been daily employed in it for two years past and yet a third of it was not done when i arrived  a large lawn extended itself in the front of the palace and here the dey had ordered a great canal to be dug and from its excavation a mount to be raised whose base measured three hundred yards in circumference the ascent was easy and spiral much resembling the prints you have seen of the tower of babel the border of this ascent was adorned all the way with lofty cedars interlaced with all sorts of aromatic and flowering shrubs and from the top before i left it was to be seen the bay the shipping the city and country all around while distant mountains on the one hand and an extent of ocean on the other alone bounded the prospect  you will think it very extraordinary gentlemen when i assure you that till i was in a state of slavery my mind never was free hitherto i had been the slave of sin and of appetite of passions and of fears but here i counted to set up my rest for life i had no parents no wealthy kindred no friend upon earth to whom i might look for a pennyworth of ransom there was therefore no further prospect for me there was nothing further left to excite my desire or to excite my concern and i sunk gradually as it were down into the peace of my own nothingness  i had been lately the possessor of the value of some thousands and now i had not wherewithal to purchase a morsel of bread but i looked back on the many scenes of my very many wickednesses and i did not look up but looked down to my god and cried not enough it is not yet enough o lord something sharper something heavier some punishment that may expiate and reconcile me to my god  one night as i lay on my bed of stubble i looked up to god through the cloud of my own iniquities and said in life o my lord lay what thou please upon me but in the hour of death save save me from the judgment whereupon something within me said fear not thou vile wretch fear not thou worm david for nothing shall be able to pluck thee out of my hands this gave me great consolation and consolation was followed by peace and peace was followed by pleasure insomuch that i possessed more of the sweetness of heartfelt enjoyment than came to the share of twenty sensualists  the dey or regent then being was called ali eben buchar he was a great warrior and yet a man of an amiable character which is rarely the case with moorish governors he had been at constantinople when i was enslaved and on his return he was so solicitously engaged in matters of state that he was not at leisure to come and see our works toward the end of the second year of my servitude he arrived with a pompous train and in a chariot drawn by tigers he was a portly and comely personage though his complexion was a deep olive he expressed high delight on surveying what we had done and he ordered a festival of three days to be proclaimed for his laborers with sports and martial exercises and prizes for the victors  great preparations were made for this entertainment in a plain on the left of the palace a square of half a mile diameter was enclosed with pales within which none were permitted to enter save the dey and his train with those who labored in his several works amounting to about a thousand men on one side within the pales a throne was erected with two seats and lower benches were placed on either hand  early on the morning of the first appointed day the festival was opened by the sound of trumpets and horns and other martial instruments  it had been a custom among us of the laborers who were young and active when the days work was over to divert our fellows with various exercises and feats such as wrestling running leaping and tossing or trundling leaden balls and so forth i was therefore up among the soonest in hopes of distinguishing myself on the occasion  by the dawning the city was emptied of its inhabitants and crowds came on after crowds from all parts of the country so that the pales were soon circled by an innumerable concourse  then came ali with his attendants and entering the pale ascended his throne his favorite sultana was placed on his left and his concubines took their places on either side and his courtiers and guards arranged themselves behind  then were exalted on poles the prizes that were to be given to such of the slaves or laborers as excelled in tossing the javelin or in hitting a distant mark with the bow or with the sling but as i had not been practiced in these matters i contented myself for this day with being a spectator some of the candidates on this occasion were extremely expert and would send an arrow or sling a stone more directly to the mark than any european could shoot a musket bullet accordingly the generous ali added freedom to the prizes which they had won and immediately preferred them among his troops  after this ali to entertain his people ordered a dozen of his courtiers to run at the ring immediately a number of neighing steeds richly caparisond were led by lackeys into the lists the young nobles without stirrup or saddle vaulted lightly into their seats and turning and winding their fiery horses with wonderful command and address gave high delight to the spectators each of them then caught a javelin which was tossed to him by an attendant and setting out successively almost at their speed three of them in mid course bore off a small ring of brass from the thread by which it hung on the point of his lance  after this again a great number of burlesque comedians entered the pales in order to act one of their african drolls or pantomimes some of them represented men some tigers hogs and bears others ghosts and others goblins but i could make nothing of such a jumblement of intention although it gave great diversion to the populace and thus ended the sports of the present day  while the people retired homeward several wagons were drawn in heavy laden with victuals and liquors wherewith all the slaves and laborers were plentifully regaled  the second day was ushered in with the like pomp as the former and prizes were set up for lifting the weight for tossing the colt and for pitching the bar  at a little distance from the front of the throne a ring was fastened to a leaden mass that weighed about five hundred pounds and above fifty adventurers successively attempted to lift but not a man of them could move it i then advanced bowing lowly toward the throne and putting my right hand in the ring and exerting my powers i raised it fairly from the ground whereupon a great shout was suddenly given by all my companions who wrought with me at the mount hereupon a black came up of herculean bulk and brawn and desiring that fifty pounds more should be added to the lead he lifted and swung them in the air with apparent ease and the prize was accordingly adjudged to him  a large iron coit was then given to the competitors and about a dozen of them tossed it to a distance that was thought extraordinary i then took it up and threw it three foot beyond the furthest but again the black slave came up who was not of our company and tossed it two foot beyond my cast and consequently achieved the second prize  a long and massive bar was then presented to us but all refused to take it in hand till the same black seized it and putting one end to his foot pitched it off to a distance that raised a cry of admiration i then took my turn and giving my whole strength and action to this single cast i pitched it some inches beyond the throw of my rival whereupon another shout was given and repeated the black then was wholly enflamed by envy and resentment and reclaiming the bar and exerting all his force he threw it to a length that on admeasurement was judged to exceed my cast and he proudly laid hold on the third prize  the great ali then ordered me to be brought before him i went and bending on my knee laid my head to the earth rise said he i obeyed and he surveyed me with long and earnest attention young man he cried you have been this day something unfortunate but you have not the less merit put this ring on your finger it discharges you henceforth from all kind of labor but it does not enfranchise you because for the present i do not choose to part with you i respectfully took the ring and again bowing to the ground retired in silence  a tournament of the young nobles then ensued wherein great feats of action and prowess was shown and the day ended with another droll to which i gave no heed  the morning of the third day was opened as usual and prizes were exhibited for wrestling for running and for leaping  immediately the black champion stepped formidably forth and challenged any to approach who desired to be crushed to death but not a man accepted this charitable invitation unwilling then that this boaster should carry off the prize without a contest i stepped from my rank depending more upon action than force to cope with him we both stripped to our canvas drawers and his looks and gestures menaced me with instant destruction i advanced however to essay him and he stretched his arms toward me as a vulture would reach his pounces to seize upon a chicken when springing instantly up to him i put a hand upon each of his shoulders and vaulting lightly over his head i turned nimbly upon him threw up his heels and laid him sidelong on the earth  as the contrast of our colors had rendered us remarkable to all the spectators a shout was set up that rent the very elements but the black rose and roared aloud with his lionlike voice for justice and the judges on weighing the matter appointed me to another trial forbidding further fraud  again we prepared to engage and again my black adversary stretched forth his arms with eyes flashing fire and features distorted with rage when retiring from him as if dismayed i shot forward like lightening and springing from the ground i pitched the whole weight of my body into his bosom this staggered him some steps backward when continuing to press upon him i put one foot behind and he fell under me with a horrible squelch upon the sand and dashing my hand against his forehead i sprung up lightly on my feet  here the people repeated their clamours which were echoed for a long space from side to side while i proposed to the judges that if my rival was not yet satisfied i would give him the other venture but the black was so far from being in plight for a third engagement that he could not rise without help on either hand and the prize being a fine turban with a diamond button was put upon my head  the competitors for the race then came from among the crowd being fifteen in number lightly equipt for the purpose and i also put on a thin canvas waistcoat that came close to my body  in the front of the throne a long pole was set up from whence we were to start and another pole was erected on the further side round which we were to run and so return to the post from whence we set out  we were all arranged in a line and ali himself was to give the word when one of our fellows either thinking or pretending to think that the word was given started away the rest followed and i was left alone quietly standing by the post why dont you set out said ali when your highness shall be pleased to give the word away then he cried and away i sprung  as i found that i was gathering them up very fast i suspended my speed and lingered behind the hindmost till they had all turned the post and extended in a long line before me i then started away and passed one and then another till having passed them all i left the oremost at a distance behind me and seized the goal whereon ali himself gave a cry of admiration which was answered from all sides by all his people  i was then presented with a velvet tunic embroidered with gold and some smaller matters were given to the two who came next to me in speed  the candidates for the third prize then rose from the ground where they had sat to repose themselves for they were the same persons who had been competitors in the race a scarlet girdle was stretched along the grass as a mark from whence the rivals were to set off on their leap and each of them took a run till they came to the appointed limit and then sprung forward with their utmost agility  as this of all others was the article of bodily exercise wherein i excelled i stood by as an unconcerned spectator till the contest was over i then measured with my eye the length they had passed then taking two men i set them in midspace and placing a pole upon their heads i took a run and throwing myself head foremost over the pole i turned in the air and alighted six inches beyond the furthest leap whereupon i was presented with a collar adorned with gems of great luster  ali then ordered two troops of his lightest horse to come forward accordingly they entered the pale and dividing they retired to opposite sides of the lists the populace then fell back and cleared the mean space and the young officers set forward on a half gallop at the head of their troops  never did i see such action such horsemanship the officers as they rode swiftly forward would toss their lances aloft and then catch them in mid air and again they would cast them to a distance before them and stooping take them from the ground in the midst of their speed  the troops then met as should seem in mortal opposition and breaking their frail lances against each other they drew their wooden sabres and each passing his adversary gave a back stroke to his neck with such force and agility as was truly alarming their ranks then appeared to be broken on either part and instantly forming themselves into little rhombs or squares or wedges they fought and mixed together as in a country dance with the most regular confusion that ever was beheld  this was justly delightful to all the spectators and i regretted their departure with the ridiculous entrance of a third pantomime  while this droll was preparing i received an order from ali to dress myself in the prizes which i had won and to attend him  i obeyed and presented myself before him what is your name young man david so please your highness are you of christ or of mahomet david my will is with christ so please you but while i confess him with my lips my whole life has denied him then david if you will but forsake christ and turn to mahomet you shall be the friend of ali and he will heap treasures and titles and great honors upon you ah my lord i cried out though i hold my christ but by a frail and feeble thread yet i would not quit that thread for a chain of golden links that should bind the whole wealth of the world to my possession and why would your highness desire the service of a traitor he who proves a traitor to his god so please you can never prove true to any master  well david said he mildly we may talk of these matters hereafter in the mean space before i do you any grace i ought at least to do you justice you have already received the rewards of your valor and your action but you have not yet received the reward of your obedience you were the only one brave david who at the risque of your own honor attended on my word and here i give you an earnest of the recompense that i intend you  so saying he presented me with a large and massive sabre whose handle was studded with gems of great value i received it on my knee and he then continued ask me now david what further gift you demand except your dismission and it shall be granted you to a tenth of the treasure in my coffers  when he had spoken my eye was caught by one of his retinue and immediately i recollected the features of the pirate barbar  i instantly cast myself prostrate before his throne and cried aloud ah generous ali may god multiply to you treasures and blessings a thousand fold i ask none of your treasures or possessions o ali i only ask the head of that traitor the head of barbar i ask but blood for blood let him restore to me my friend my brother my lord osmyn he is a murderer a traitor and such i will prove him by night or by day by sea or by land at any weapons against any odds i will prove him a traitor  while i spoke thus impassioned all about appeared under the utmost consternation and barbar trembled and turned pale but did not dare to quit his station  rise david said ali and tell me what friend what osmyn thou do mean all i know of him my lord is that his name was osmyn of petra and that he was nephew to some great prince in this part of the world  why you dream surely david replied the regent osmyn of petra was my own nephew and he perished with all his crew by the hands of the english  he did not perish by the hands of the english i cried the english were his preservers his friends his attendants and he perished by the hands of his own countrymen and more especially by the hands of this traitor barbar  well said ali we have not leisure at present to examine into the truth of these allegations guards take that barbar into safe and close custody till we are better informed touching the facts with which he is charged mean time do you david follow in my train for you must take up your lodging with me this night  the place though it appeared one uniform edifice was divided into two by an impassable barrier the one was the occasional habitation of ali and his attendants and his wives with their eunuchs were lodged in the other where it was impalement for any man save ali himself to enter  the generous ali was not of a jealous temper he gave his women uncommon liberties as you have seen for though they were kept by their veils from the eyes of the vulgar yet those veils were of so very thin a gauze that they could clearly discern every object about them  for three days and nights after i entered his palace though i was treated with an attention that gave me much uneasiness yet i had not the honor of being called to his presence  at length i was conducted by a private door to his cabinet my friend david said he what have thou to tell me concerning my dear and brave nephew osmyn i then minutely and at large recited to him the particulars above related and we shed many tears that were mutually provoked by the tears of each other  having closed my narration he cast his eyes down awhile as in deep meditation and raising them again he said the presumptions are strong very strong against this man and yet there is a possibility that he may be guiltless and though osmyn is my nephew my blood and almost my bowels yet honor humanity demands of us david that nine criminals should escape the punishment they deserve rather than one innocent person should perish in his righteousness but the great alla may give us further lights in this business  in about five days after a convict was to be gaunched for the rape and murder of a free woman he was to be thrown from the top of a high tower from whose walls projected several sharp and shagged instruments resembling hooks scythes tenters etc at certain distances some below others  he fainted several times as he was carrying to execution and then being in an agony he said he had a matter of the highest consequence to impart to the great ali and prayed to be brought directly into his presence  i was on the spot when he was led in and looking earnestly at him recollected that he was the ruffian who had spit in my face and given me a buffet when i entered barbars ship  wretch cried the dey what have thou to say to ali that i am guilty answered the convict of crimes more heinous and capital than that for which i am to suffer of crimes that nearly concern yourself o ali but which you shall never know unless you swear to me by mahomet to mitigate the manner of my death i do swear it said the regent provided the discovery which you make shall be found of due import  he then deposed that on the night in which osmyn disappeared the captain with ten confederated ruffians of whom he was one entered the princes cabin and having muffled the faces of him and his attendant to prevent their crying out bound them hand and foot and heaved them through the window into a boat that waited for them that then getting into the frigate they massacred the seven moors to whose care she had been left and rifling her of all the money and plate and valuables that they could find they got into their boat and sinking the frigate with osmyn and his attendant in her they made way with oar and sail to the nearest shore where they divided their plunder and staving the boat made separately off to different regions  here barbar was sent for and came in chains and attended by guards into the presence but as soon as he saw the face of the convict without waiting to be confronted by his evidence he rushed violently with his head foremost toward the opposite marble and if a man who was at hand had not caught him by the chain he would instantly have dashed his skull to shivers  ali hereupon without further examination ordered the head of the convict to be struck off in the morning and barbar to be impaled in the face of the people  never was joy like mine on hearing this sentence pronounced against barbar and i rose early the next morning in order to have the pleasure of being at his execution  he was so enfeebled by his panicks that they were obliged to draw him on a sled to the stake and the muscling of his countenance had all the impressions of death despair and hell represented upon it  this however did not affect me with any other sensation than of that delight which is naturally felt on the gratification of revenge till the executioners with unfeeling hearts and merry tauntings began to take the wretch in hand but when i saw them with difficulty and great violence thrusting the stake through his body which they run up withinside the spinal bone and so out at the back of his neck in order to avoid his bowels and keep him the longer in anguish when i saw him writhing in agony and heared his horrible roars and groanings all my revenge was quickly turned into terror and compassion his pangs and sufferings as it seemed were transferred to my own person and had i not turned away i should have fainted on the spot  the dey from this time became extremely fond of me and familiar with me he allotted me an affluent pension with slaves horses and attendants he said i should be to him in the place of a nephew and of a son and he called me by the name of davidosmyn  some time after tidings were brought that caled amurath of fez was making mighty preparations to invade his dominions we will more than meet him half way cried the gallant ali perhaps we may even prevent his threatened expedition he then summoned his forces from all quarters i was present when he made a general muster of them his foot were more formidable for their numbers than their discipline but his horse were perfectly trained and made a most brilliant appearance  the day before he set out i threw myself at his feet i will go with you my master i will go with you i cried i will not have any command or post of preference or honor i only desire permission to fight by your side that you may witness how greatly i shall dare in your cause how ready i shall be to take to my own bosom all the weapons that shall be aimed at your bosom my father  no david he replied my people know you are still a christian i could not refrain from showing the love i have for you and that might be matter of jealousy and discontent to my captains i will leave you here a band of soldiers with whom you are to encamp within sight of my palace and to keep these walls from violence and my women from pollution but while you are their guardian beware that you do not turn an invader david i would pardon you any thing but this i would not pardon you the invasion of my bed davidosmyn no my lord i cried aloud i cannot prove ungrateful though your women were as obvious to my walks as yonder pavement and though adorned with more graces than their first mother in paradise they should have no temptation for me my master  the next morning ali began his march and having escorted him a piece on his way i returned to my charge  that night as i lay in my tent i began to call myself to account david said i to my soul thou have now gotten preferment and riches and honors thou art as it were the second man in the realm and all this people have thee in high estimation but art thou the better or the happier man for all this david far otherwise far otherwise o frail and vain heart these gauds and these glories have taken hold upon thee and they have drawn a painted veil between me and my god to my chain and my straw and my nakedness return me to them o lord return me to my slavery return me to my labors i was not then indeed gaining conquests and winning prizes but i was near to obtaining the prize of the high calling my body was not then adorned with gold and pearl but my spirit rejoiced in the pearl of mighty price  in about five weeks after as i was taking by moonlight my evenings walk of meditation on the marble that checquered the pavement before the palace muley an old black and chief of the eunuchs of the seraglio came up and accosted me osmyn said he taking a bundle from under his arm i have here a present for you that would make proud the greatest emperor upon earth it is a complete suit wrought purposely for you by the fingers of the sultana as also by the fingers of her fair and princely sisters they saw your great atchievments during the festival and they send you this in return for the pleasure which you gave them  so saying he unfolded the robes to the moon they were flowered with needled gold and inlaid with pearl and gems of such a vivid luster as reflected her beams with tenfold brightness  and what is required of me muley i demanded in return for this inestimable honor and bounty nothing said muley but a single hours attendance to give them a short sketch of your life and adventures take back your presents i cried there is poison and death in them i will not betray the trust that our master has reposed in me nay said muley i affirm to you that there is no such intention our ladies are all women of the severest chastity i will undertake to conduct and reconduct you back in safety neither can our master be betrayed in any degree they all live together they love like sisters and no one keeps a secret from the other however they desired me to tell you that if you are of a fearful temper they will not insist on the favor so much expected  here i felt myself piqued no muley i cried i am no coward i can dare all honest dangers i will attend you but i will not stay muley i will let your ladies know that in the cause of honor and virtue i can resist all temptations  i then called a distant slave who waited my orders and giving him the bundle desired him to lay it within my tent where now muley said i i will show you said muley  he then led me to a large bucket wherein water was accustomed to be raised by pullies to the balcony and there to be emptied into vessels that stood upon the leads  you must not enter any door of the lower story said muley for there our domestics inhabit and might probably observe you but if you get into this bucket in a minute or two after i will raise you by the pullies and take you gently in  muley then went from me and was admitted on striking at a distant door while i stood by the bucket and observing its first motion jumped in and was conveyed to the top of the palace  muley there received me in darkness and silence and taking me by the hand led me down by a few steps into a narrow apartment that was scarcely enlightened by a glimmering lamp he there left me again giving me only a whispering promise that he would quickly return i waited for him long however under great impatience of getting speedily back again at length he came and taking me by the hand without speaking a word he led me through a long and dark entry till coming to a folding door he touched a spring whereupon the door flew open on either side and threw a sudden blaze upon my dazzled eyes  the saloon upon which it opened was profusely illuminated and most sumptuously furnished but my attention was quickly called from such inferior objects in the midst a board was covered with an elegant collation of little matters around it were placed a great number of small sofas and behind each sofa stood a lady richly adorned but veiled from the head to the waist  again muley led me to the further end while i made low obeisance as i passed the company he then compelled me to sit where by a small turn of my head i could have a full prospect of each fairone at table then as by one motion they were all instantly seated and again as by one motion they all instantly threw up their veils and i had like to have fallen backward with the suddenness of the luster that flashed upon my spirit  all the ladies smiled and seemed delighted at my astonishment the sultana adelaide sat nearest to me on the right and was no way distinguished from her sisters but by a small coronet of feathered diamonds that was inserted in her lovely locks osmyn said she you seem something surprised were you never in a seraglio before have you no seraglios in your country osmyn no madam i replied we have no seraglio in our country but sure no seraglio upon earth ever produced such and so many beauties as now strike my eyes heaven alone can exhibit such a constellation of luminaries  would you not wish then said adelaide to have such a seraglio of your own no madam i answered without love in my judgment there can be no true enjoyment if ever i love it can be but the one object and her i shall love with my whole heart true love will admit of no division here she looked at me with a tenderness that sunk into my soul and taking out her handkerchief she wiped away a swelling tear  another lady then demanded if we had not a woman market and if they were not slaves in my country as they were here no madam i replied our fairones ones there are not the subjects of merchandise but the objects of admiration no woman in england can be bound to any lover save by her own affections there it is death for any man to have more than one wife and that after a suit perhaps of several years a lady there of equal beauties to the least excellent in company would be followed by hundreds of humble and sighing adorers in england our actions are as free as our hearts and the sensibilities of mutual love between those of the sexes who feel the tender and enchanting passion constitute the principal happiness of which life is capable  happy englishwomen happy englishwomen was echoed all around  alas cried the lovely adelaide how very different is our fate we are sold like servile brutes to any brute of a master we neither love nor are beloved as you now have convinced me osmyn we are subjected to vile desires which we at once detest and suffer and when those desires are gratified we are cast away as common lumber to make room for some new comer even high as i sit here the favored sultana of my lord i may tomorrow be appointed to the meanest offices of his household this surely cannot be a marriage for as you have intimated osmyn and as i feel in my own soul marriage can only consist in an union of hearts love cannot be bought or sold it is of too precious a nature nothing can purchase nothing compensate save its value in love alone  here they pressed me to tell them my story and here i confess to my shame that however vile i appeared in my own eyes i was ambitious of appearing as honorable and deserving as possible in the eyes of the fair adelaide i therefore suppressed what was black glossed over what was offensive and enlarged on every thing that i deemed advantageous in my own character  the night was far spent by the time i concluded and the sultana arising proposed to show me the curiosities of an adjoining cabinet i accordingly attended her and was astonished at the luster the richness and profusion of the jewels as well as at the miracles of art that she displayed before my eyes  on our return we perceived that our company had absconded adelaide grew all crimson and cast down her eyes i also was confused my heart began to throb and i looked about for some pretense to make a quick escape but  but  in short gentlemen neither my resolutions nor religion nor honor nor gratitude were of any avail against such a temptation they fell together an easy victim to the allconquering adelaide  adelaide was the first to press my retreat it was not yet day i found muley in waiting we came by the way we went i stepped into the bucket and he let me gently down  as i approached the pavement i felt a hand behind that seized me violently by the shoulder i sprung out and seizing the wretch by the throat would instantly have plunged my poniard into his bosom but some power as suddenly arrested my arm and said to my heart beware that thou add not murder to adultery david  while i hesitated a number rushed upon me unaware they griped me by each arm and wresting the poniard from me they bound my hands behind and led me to the cells of the imams that stood something aloof from one end of the palace  as soon as they had brought lights what osmyn exclaimed their chief can this be our renowned osmyn is it thus that you repay the favors of your generous and kind master you are a christian cried another has your christ then taught you to betray the confidence and trust that is reposed in you this was a home stab it went through my heart but i stood in a shamefaced sullenness and opened not my lips  here they went apart and having consulted awhile returned osmyn said their chief you are a brave and a wonderful man and it is a pity to lose you your secret is yet with us and we swear to you by our holy prophet and by the terrible alha that if you perform the single condition we enjoin we will bury what we know in a depth below the grave and we will recommend you to the love of ali and the acclamations of all the people and we will have you loaded with preferments and riches and honors name it quickly i cried whatever it may be at the risque at the loss of my life i will perform it it is said he no more than to abjure christ and to confess mahomet whose priests we are and all the blessings of his paradise shall be showerd down upon you  here i gave a deep groan and casting down my head and shedding a silent tear without daring to lift my thoughts to heaven no no i cried though christ is nothing to me though i have no interest in him though he spurns and has rejected me for time and for eternity though i have daily denied him by every action of my life yet my tongue shall never deny him in poverty and nakedness in dangers and in dungeons in death here and in hell hereafter my mouth shall confess him  here they went apart again and returning told me that i should have two days to deliberate on their proposal but that if i did not comply i should be impaled alive on the third morning with all the additional tortures that art could invent  they then put me into a covered kind of a wagon and conveyed me to  where i was cast into a noisome dungeon bolted down to the ground with irons sustained with coarse bread and water and not allowed a ray of light to divert my thoughts from the darkness and horrors of my situation  mean time i endeavored to reinforce my resolution by repeating to myself the sacred promise where christ says whosoever will confess me upon earth him will i confess before my father which is in heaven mine indeed said i is but a verbal confession but even that with what i am about to suffer for his sake may serve to make me less criminal if not acceptable in his sight  i then longed to be brought to the test while i shuddered at the thoughts of it at length the day arrived the imams came and once more repeated the question but i still persisted though in terms that were scarcely intelligible for my tongue cleaved with terror to the roof of my mouth  they then stripped me to these drawers out of which also they took my money with other valuables and every thing except this insignificant walnut and having tied me to a sled i was dragged to the place of execution  the chief imam once more asked if i would renounce the son of david but i made him no answer for i was unable to speak i had seen the preparations the stake in the hands of the executioners the fires kindled about me with horrid instruments ready to be put therein for the tearing of my frying and quivering flesh from the bones  could i then have had the confidence to have turned my soul to god and to have besought his assistance in that trying and terrible hour i make no question but he would have given me strength from on high to defy all that man or devils could do unto me and i might now in the regions of his bounty and his blessedness have been pouring forth my existence in the grateful and astonished sense of his mercy to such a sinner  but when i reflected on the wrythings of barbar the bare sight of which my spirit was not able to support when i saw such an apparatus of additional torments and when they took me in hand for instant execution i utterly lost my senses i shrunk inward with fear my hairs stood on end with horror my tongue found sudden utterance and i cried stay stay i will say i will do whatever you enjoin  the imam then began to pronounce a form of renunciation which he ordered me to repeat after him but i was so panting and breathless that they were obliged to get a cordial for me to keep me from swooning  as soon as my spirits were something restored the imam again began his impious ceremony and i make no question but i should have gone through it however abhorrent to my soul but in that instant we heard distant shouts and cries as of many people the sound of the clamours drew nearer and nearer and soon after we saw numbers hurrying to and hurrying from the city their words became now as distinct as they were audible ali is slain ali is slain was all the cry and amurath comes in full march upon us  here all turned suddenly from me and flying several ways left me unbound and alone sitting close by the stake seeing this i began to recover from the fearful and faint condition in which i was and rising i made the best of my way to the port there i saw a long boat just about to set off with a number of fellows much in my own plight and taking a run i sprung from the beach into the midst of them  a man then demanded in english if i was one of the ransomed yes ransomed ransomed i cried wonderfully ransomed indeed whereupon without further question they set up their sail and in about two hours we reached the ship which the consul had appointed to take them in  for the remainder of that day i continued in a state that is hard to be conceived my head and stomach at times were disordered by sick fits and my soul hovered in an astonished and fearful kind of doze as one not rightly awaked from a dream of horror  toward evening i threw myself down in the hold and sunk into a state of utter oblivion as i had not slept for the three foregoing nights and days  the day following i found my body something refreshed but the situation of my mind was like that of a disturbed and tumbling sea after a raging storm i looked around for comfort but no comfort was near i looked afar off for hope but no hope came in prospect the sense of existence became a misery under which i was not able to bear up and could i have had my wish creation would again have been uncreated  during the whole of our voyage i continued very nearly in this distemper of spirit for though at times i would enter into the frolics and jovial humors of the crew yet my merriment at such seasons was a merriment to madness and i would again sink precipitately into a depth of despondence whose darkness would admit no ray of consolation  the tempter would then urge me by dagger or by drowning or by any means to get rid of a being that only served to torment me but again the dread that i might not get rid of that being and that death might plunge me into a perpetuity of those pangs in which i saw the wretched barbar agonizing this deterred me from hastening the day of my horrid doom and so i waited in a gloomy and fearful looking out for judgment  i would then call myself at dead of night before that terrible judgment thou fiend david i would say wherefore art thou sunk in guilt above all that ever were guilty it was thy fortune to get three good and kind masters good and kind above thy wants and even up to thy wishes and all these thou have deceived thou have spoiled and betrayed them even the master of all masters the master who was my freedom in the midst of my captivity i was on the brink of denying the jesus also nay i did reject i did deny him i promised i engaged to reject and deny him and he will reject thee through time and through eternity he will deny thee david  one evening a fearful tempest arose and while most of the crew gave some of their little matters to the providore for liquors and sat drowning the sense of danger and profanely carousing at one end of the ship my companions who are present were praying or singing glory to god in the other both parties invited me to join them but i refused to be partaker with either for i could not abet in others that wickedness which i condemned and detested in myself and i could not think of taking into my execrable mouth the sacred name of that christ to whom i had so lately turned a false apostate in the mean time i held myself as the refugee jonas whose crimes had brought perdition on all in the vessel and i was on the point of advising the mariners to cast me out  at length the tempest abated but my perturbations did not abate i wished to repent but i deemed myself past the possibility of repentance and thus i continued in a state of dissatisfaction and enmity against myself against my god against man and woman kind  when the constables entered and by the order of sir thomas laid hold on such a number of my late associates though i thought that i did not care what became of me yet nature began to reassert her rights i trembled and turned exceeding pale as i suppose all my crimes came rushing together into my memory i imagined that they were exposed before your eyes also and i expected each moment to be seized like my fellow culprits and thrown into a dungeon but when i found that instead of punishment you proposed to load me with your bounties all my sins appeared to me the more exceedingly sinful your goodness came in a heap upon the heap of my own guilt and i fell prostrate at your feet as under the weight of a mountain  as soon as he had closed his story take courage and comfort to you david i cried your case is not near so desperate as your conscientious fears have formed it your error lay in trusting to your own sense of duty and to the strength of your own powers for resisting temptation and the best man that ever breathed with no better a dependence must inevitably have fallen as you did david you now know your own weakness you are taught by repeated experience that in or of yourself you no more can stand against the enemies of your soul when they assail you than a tree severed from its root and barely set on end can stand the assaults of a coming tempest keep therefore to your root david never dare in your own strength to oppose yourself to a reed apply to the rock my friend from whence you were hewn cling to him repose upon him put your whole confidence in him and then your weakness shall become stronger than an army with banners and neither life nor death nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come shall be able to separate you from the love of god which is in christ jesus  while i spoke his eyes began to glisten the cloud of his countenance cleared his aspect assumed a cheerful serenity he could scarce have been known for the same person and he cried i will i will once more seek to my god do you my master pray him to permit my approach and in life or in death i never will let go my hold of him any more he then would again have cast himself at my feet but i hastened to prevent him  david said i i am going for france and before i set out i should be greatly pleased to see you in some decent way of livelihood now instead of the twenty pounds of which you held yourself so unworthy here are two hundred to make a kind of beginning for you and i should be glad to know the use you propose to make of this money  in the first place sir said he i will refund to my two masters all the money of which i defrauded them with full or double interest amounting as i suppose to seventy or eighty pounds and in the next place i will return to your honor every penny of the remainder for indeed you shall not persuade me to trust myself with it in my present way of thinking it would be of no more use to me than the stones or dirt of the street my state of slavery and labor was the only state of happiness that i have known since my birth and i dread i shudder at the apprehension of affluence i am already but too rich in having my liberty i am now in a free country and therefore lord of my own earnings matter of labor is but matter of play to me the pay of a porter on the spot where i am will be too much of opulence it will give me a further sufficiency to supply the wants of the needy and the cravings of the beggar  my good david my beloved penitent said the worthy sir thomas and so saying he took him most cordially by the hand how came you by that same walnut the only remnant of all your treasures which you called insignificant and have yet retained to this day you are as pharaoh to his chief butler sir said david you bring my faults fully into the remembrance of your servant  while the sultana as i told you was showing and displaying to me the treasures of her cabinet she desired me to take thereout whatever i held most rare or most estimable but as my covetous fit was not then upon me i turned my eye on a few walnuts that i saw in a corner and taking one of them said that i would keep it for her sake swear to me then she cried that you will never break or open it till you get into your own country this was an easy condition and i instantly complied with it  did you love the sultana david yes sir to excess as i am also persuaded that she loved me and we vowed to intermarry if ever it should be our fortune to regain our liberty and bound or free never to marry another  let me look at your walnut david said sir thomas you are now under no further injunction concerning it do not break it i beseech you then sir said david because i intend never to part with it i will not break it david i will only open it with my knife and a little matter of isinglass may soon repair the breach  sir thomas then took the walnut and having poised it for some time in his hand i will give you a hundred guineas david said he for your hazard of what this shell contains i would take a hundred pence sir said david if i was inclined to take your money without giving value sir thomas then took his knife and dividing the shell with the utmost caution i have a strong fancy david said he that i must soon raise the market and instantly produced a diamond of the first water and magnitude  we all started back and looked astonished and david was the only person in company who neither by word or look expressed the smallest joy or satisfaction on the occasion  sir thomas who was a jeweller having inspected the stone awhile with much delight and admiration mr david said he i would offer you seventeen hundred pieces for this diamond if i did not think my offer considerably under the value but i shall be a better judge when i have put it in the scales keep it keep it sir cried david and heartily welcome return me only the shell it is all i will accept of then turning to me a pale and alarmed aspect ah sir said he this is questionless another device of the tempter i fear that i am not to get quit of my old associate so soon as i looked for i do not think with you david in this matter i replied i rather conceive that providence has sent you this treasure at a time that he sees you will make a worthy use of it oh sir he cried if it shall ever again be my case to fall off from my god i shall certainly run mad or make away with myself why so david said i you must not expect all on a sudden to jump into a sinless state such a state is only for those who have already fought the good fight who have finished their course who have kept the faith such a state is only for those in whom the babe of bethlehem is not only conceived but grown up and become mature these indeed cannot sin but run with a joyful and free will into all sorts of goodness as a stream is prone to run to its kindred and parent ocean but as for such as you and i brother david we must be content to struggle on and to fall and rise by turns and though we should fall an hundred times a day yea and be sore wounded also my david yet we should not despond but turn as often to our helper in total diffidence of ourselves and full confidence in his mightiness for he is almighty to lift us up whenever he thinks good and the balm of calvary is better than the balm of gilead to heal all our woundings  i will tell you another secret david which i learned from a saint who is now deceased that the humbling state of frequent and conscious lapses is more eligible and tending to higher blessedness for man than the firmness and rectitude of an unfallen angel because it saps selfconfidence and creaturely dependence and throws one wholly on the base that pillars up eternity  here he catched at my hand and pressing his lips upon it what shall i render you my master what shall i render you he cried for the peace and comfort which you have shed abroad through my bosom i may now draw near to the throne of compassion heavy laden with all my sins that is to say with all myself and i will trust to free mercy for removing the burden and to free grace alone for any good that shall ever be in me  as it now grew late we agreed that sir thomas should take david home in his own coach and that i should take thomas with me in a hackney and i gave their remaining comrades an order for a hundred and fifty guineas per man  when we were just upon separating thomas caught david about the neck o my dear david said he i shall surely never dare to judge any man again for i held you to be a very reprobate when you were fifty times over a better man than myself hereupon i wished sir thomas and david a good night and making tirlah and thomas go into the coach before me my two servants lighted us home with each a torch in his hand  as i entered the house mrs tirrel met me with a sudden joy in her countenance my dear sir she cried i began to be in trouble about you i have kept supper back this long time then said i let us have it as soon as you please for i have here brought a dear friend home with me  i placed the twins directly opposite to each other at table and i made tirlah and young james sit down along with us  while i was pleasingly employed in observing the mutual emotions of the brother and sister they looked eagerly at each other they both changed countenance and neither of them offered to taste a bit mr thomas said i why dont you eat thomas thomas cried the sister in a quick and passionate accent it may be  it may be  o  my brother  so saying she gave a jump which for the world she could not have done at any other time over tumbled the table meat dishes and plates while she catched and clung about her brother without casting a thought away upon the ruins that she had wrought o my tommy o my nelly my tommy my nelly was all that was uttered in the midst of their caresses they saw no one but each other they heard no one but each other and i would gladly lose or give a thousand suppers to be feasted as i was at that season  when mr clinton came to this part of his story a messenger entered in fearful haste and delivered a letter to lady maitland as soon as she had run it over my dearest sir she cried i must leave you this instant i lately made you an offer of a hundred thousand pounds and now i know not that i have so many shillings upon earth i am here informed that the trustee of all my affairs has absconded and made his escape to france but i must hurry to town and enquire into this business so saying she courtesied and suddenly withdrew without giving her cousin time to make a tender of his services  the next morning mr clinton ordered his chariot to the door and hastened to attend her ladyship at her house in london but there he was told that she had set out for dover about an hour before and he returned much dejected and grieved on her account  in about three weeks after mr clement with his young pupil came home quite lightened of the money they had taken abroad mr fenton for so we shall call him again gave clement a friendly embrace and took harry to his caresses as though he had returned from a long and dangerous voyage  well clement said mr fenton what account have you to give us of your expedition an account sir that would be extremely displeasing to any man living except yourself in short our young gentleman here has plunged you above a thousand pounds in debt over the large sums that we carried with us i hope the objects were worthy said mr fenton wonderfully worthy indeed sir i never saw such tender and affecting scenes then i shall be overpaid and enriched by the narration  here harry enquired impatiently for mrs clement and his friend ned and being told that they were on a visit to the widow neighbourly he took a hasty leave for the present and away he flew to embrace them  as soon as he was gone sir said mr clement i cannot think that there is in the world such another boy as yours i will leave to himself the detail of our adventures in the several prisons they had such an effect on his heart that they cannot but have made a deep impression on his memory so i shall only tell you of what happened in our way to london  as we were chatting and walking leisurely along the road a poor man before us happened to drop in a fit of the falling sickness when harry saw the writhings and convulsions in which he lay he turned pale and looked vastly frightened and seizing me under the arm he cried come come away and hurried me off as fast as he could but we had not gone far till his pace began to abate and stopping and hesitating let us turn let us turn mr clement he cried let us go back again and help the poor man we then returned hastily and raising his head we kept him from bruising it against the ground i then forced open his clenched hands and having chafed the palms awhile he began to recover and soon came to himself meanwhile harrys fright was not yet quite over he seemed willing to get away from the object of his terror and putting his hand in his pocket and giving him all the silver he had he wished him better health and away we went  we had not gone above half a mile further when i saw a little girl in a field on the right hand endeavoring to drive a cow through a small gate into the road in order to be milked as i suppose by her mother but the cow kicked up her heels and proved wanton and refractory and ran hither and thither and would not be guided the poor child then set up a cry of as bitter distress as if all that was valuable in the world was going to ruin harry gave a ready ear to the sound of lamentation and seeing the plight that the poor thing was in he suddenly crossed the road above ankle deep in dirt and leaping the ditch he proved nimbler than the cow and driving her through the pass he turned her into the way that the child would have her go  that morning indeed was to harry a morning of petty adventures by the time that we approached the suburbs we had nearly overtaken a grown girl who carried a basket of eggs on her head a great lubberly boy just then passed us by at a smart pace and tripping up to the girl gave the basket a tip with his hand and dashed all the eggs into mash against a stoney part of the road and again taking to his heels run on as before immediately harrys indignation was kindled and setting out at top speed he soon overtook him and gave him several smart strokes with his little cane across the shoulders the fellow then turned upon harry and gave him a furious blow with his fist over the head while i hastened to his relief as i perceived that the other was quite an overmatch for him but before i arrived our hero had put a quick end to the combat for springing from the ground he darted his head full into the nose and mouth of his adversary who instantly roared out and seeing his own blood come pouring down he once more took to flight while harry continued to press upon him and belabored him at pleasure till he judged that he had beaten him to the full value of the eggs  meanwhile the poor girl wholly unmindful of what passed remained wailing and wringing her hands over the wreck of her merchandise the voice of a siren could not so powerfully have attracted and recalled harry from the length he had gone he returned with speed to her and i followed my poor girl says he where were you going with those eggs to market master says she and what did you expect to get for them about five shillings sir and i had promised my daddy and mammy to lay it out in shoes and stockings for my little brothers and sisters and so i must now hear all the blame of the poor things going barefoot here she again set up her wailings and her tears poured down afresh  harry then desired me to lend him ten shillings and turning to the mourner hold out your two hands my poor girl he cried then putting five shillings into each hand here is the payment for your eggs said he and here are five shillings more though i fear it is too little to pay you for all the tears they cost you  never did i see so sudden so great a change in any countenance surprise gratitude ecstasy flashed from her eyes and gave a joyous flush to the muscling of her aspect she hurried her money into her bosom and dropping on her knees in the dirt and seizing hold of harrys hand she squeezed and kissed it repeatedly without being able to utter a word while harrys eyes began to fill and endeavoring to disengage himself he made off as fast as he could from such thanks as he thought he had no way deserved  this sir was the last of our adventures going to london but had you seen us on our return about two hours ago you would have wondered at the mirey plight into which we were put by helping pasfengers up with their bundles that had tumbled into the dirt or by assisting to raise cattle that had fallen under their carriages for master harry would compel me to be as busy and active in matters of charity as himself  however sir i am to tell you that master harry with all his excellencies of person heart and understanding will be accounted a mere idiot among people of distinction if he is not permitted to enter into some of the fashionable foibles and fashionable vices of the age  we were taking a walk in the mall when we were met by the earl of mansfield who expressed great joy at seeing master harry his old acquaintance as he called him and he pressed us so earnestly to dinner that we could not in manners refuse him  there was a vast concourse of company more especially of the little quality of both sexes who came to pay their respects to young lord bottom and his sister the lady louisa  harry was received and saluted by lady mansfield and the young lord without any appearance of the old animosity some time after dinner a large packet of letters was brought into the earl and making his excuse to harry alone he rose from the table and retired to his closet  lord bottom and his sister then led the young males and females to an adjoining apartment where several cardtables were laid and i began to tremble for the credit of my pupil on the occasion as i knew him to be a novice in such matters  in the mean time the remaining ladies and gentlemen divided into two or three parties at ombre and i saunterd about the room admiring the prints of the ariadne and the aurora that were taken from guido as also some capital paintings that the earl had brought from italy  i had spent above an hour in this pleasing amusement and had nearly made the tour of the whole dining room when as i stood at a little distance behind my ladys chair seemingly inattentive to any thing that passed lord bottom entered on tiptoe and tripping up to his mother and tittering and whispering in her ear what do you think mamma said he sure master fenton is a fool a downright fool upon my honor he does not know a single card in the whole pack he does not know the difference between the ace of hearts and the nine of clubs i dont think either that he knows any thing of the difference or value of coin for as we passed through the hall to day a beggar asked for a halfpenny and i saw him slip a shilling into his hand indeed mamma he is the greatest fool that ever i knew and yet poor fellow he does not seem to know any thing of the matter himself  during this oration of lord bottom on the virtues of his new friend i felt my whole body glow and tingle with concern and soon after harry entered with the rest of the small quality master fenton cries my lady i beg to speak with you dont you know the cards my dear no indeed madam cannot you play at dice no madam can you play draughts or polish or chess not at all madam why then my dear i must tell you that all your fathers fortune will never introduce you among people of any breeding or of any fashion can you play at no kind of game master harry a little at fox and geese madam and pray my dear said my lady smiling which of the parties do you espouse the part of the geese madam i thought as much pertly cried out my lord bottom whereupon a loud laugh was echoed through the room  here my lady chid the company and calling harry to her again for he had gone something aloof tell me i pray you said she why you espouse the part of the geese because madam i always wish that simplicity should get the better of fraud and cunning  the countess here looked astonished and having gazed awhile at him and caught and kissed him eagerly you are a noble fellow she cried and all must be fools or mad that ever shall take you for the one or the other  the elder gentry here laid their cards aside and desired the young ones to set about some play lady louisa proposed drawgloves or questions and commands and to it they went  among the females was one miss uppish sole heiress to a vast fortune though her person was deformed her face was the very picture of confident disdain and scarce any one could speak to her or look at her without being told of the contempt she had for them by the sideglance of her eye the writhing of her neck and tossing up of her head  in the course of the play our harry was commanded to put the candle into the hand of miss uppish and then to kiss the candlestick which command he obeyed literally by giving her the candle and kissing the candlestick which he held in his own hand  hereupon a great shout was set up in the young assembly and o the fool the senseless creature the fool the fool the fool was repeated throughout while lord bottom laughed and danced about in the impatience of his joy  i was amazed that harrys countenance seemed no way disconcerted by all this ridicule at length lady mansfield called him to her how my dear could you be guilty of such an error she said did not you know that when you gave the candle into the hand of the young lady she became the candlestick and it was her you should have kissed harry then approached to her ladyships ear and in a pretty loud whisper said i did not like the metal madam that the candlestick was made of again lady mansfield looked surprised and said you are a sly rogue a very sly rogue upon my honor and have sense enough to dupe the wisest of us all  jemmy bottom cried my lady aloud come here i cannot but tell you jemmy that you have behaved yourself extremely ill to your young friend here who might have improved you by his example as much as he has honored you by his visit i must further tell you jemmy bottom that whenever you pique yourself on degrading master fenton you only pride in your own abasement and glory in your shame hereupon i got up and leaving our compliments for the earl i carried off my young charge for fear of our falling into any further disgrace  while harry is abroad said mr fenton be pleased to give me a general sketch of the manner in which you disposed of your money in the first place sir answered clement you will find by this list that for little more than the five hundred pounds allotted we released ninety five prisoners whose debts amounted from forty shillings to about twelve pounds per man these in the general had been journeymen tailors or weavers or professors of other inferior crafts and as they wanted means or encouragement for exercising their respective occupations in gaol they subsisted on the pence which they got by begging at the grates or on their dividends of occasional sums which were sent for their relief by charitable individuals nearly all of them were thin in flesh and extremely shabby in clothing and yet they could hardly be said to excite compassion as they appeared so cheerful and unfeeling of their own wretchedness neither was there one of them that i could learn a single circumstance of whose story was worth reciting  some however were of a quality much superior to this class among others there was a french marquis and a german prince the prince had been put under arrest by his caterer and the marquis by his tailor so that something less than fifty pounds set them both at liberty  while the keeper of the fleet prison was making out a list for us of the principal debtors harry and i took a turn about the court and observed two fellows in liveries bearing several smoking covers up the stone stairs to a front dining room this surprised me and gave me the curiosity to enquire what prisoner it could be who lived in so expensive and superb a manner sir said the under keeper there are few men now at liberty near so wealthy as this gentleman who has done us the honor to set up his staff of rest in our house his name is sink he is an attorney and an old bachelor turned of sixty years of age he is in for several sums amounting to upward of nine thousand pounds and he is reputed to be worth above double that money  during the last twenty years he behaved himself with the strictest probity toward all men and with the strictest appearance of piety toward god in the dark in frost and snow and all inclemencies of weather he never missed attending morning service at church he was equally solicitous to be at evening prayer and whatever company he chanced to have with him or how important soever the business in which he was engaged the moment he heard the bell ring he would huddle up his papers and break away without ceremony he was eager in his enquiries to know where the sacrament was soonest to be administered and he never missed receiving at least once in the week whenever he heard any profaneness or obscenity in the streets he would stop to reprove and expostulate with the offender in short he so perfectly counterfeited or took off as they call it the real christian that many looked to see him like enoch or elijah taken alive into heaven  this perpetual parade of sanctity gave him such an eclat and unmeasurable credit that he was left trustee and executor in a multitude of wills and numbers also deposited their substance in his hands in order to be laid out at interest on securities and so forth  three months since about the dawning as his butcher happened to pass by his door he heard it open and turning saw a number of porters come out heavy laden this gave him a kind of suspicion he let them all pass and walking softly after he stepped up to the hindmost and offered him half a crown on condition of his telling him where they were carrying those parcels that i will said the porter for the secret if such it is is nothing to me you know in short we are carrying them to the wharf to be put on board a boat that waits to take them in  the butcher said no more but hurried away to the baker and as they both run to the office they met the brewer by the way they took out their respective actions and taking a constable with them they seized on good mr sink as he was stepping into a coach and six to make the best of his way to dover he would have paid them their money and discharged their actions on the spot but here the master in whom he trusted happened to leave him in the lurch as he had turned all his effects into money and his money into paper he had not at hand wherewith to pay his instant creditors so they hurried him to gaol and before the banks were open the matter was blown and action after action came pouring fast upon him  when he found himself thus at bay he cast aside his disguise and set them all at defiance his creditors have since offered to accept ten shillings and some of them to accept five shillings in the pound but he swears that he will never pay them a groat for he is now as liberal of his oaths and impious execrations as he was lately of his more impious profanation of gospel phrases and thus he daily revels in the sensual consumption of those wretches whom he has so inhumanly defrauded while hundreds of orphans and widows and other miserables perish for want of the sustenance which one infernal appetite devours without remorse nay several of his creditors are at this very time famishing in this prison while they see him feasting so lavishly upon their spoils  the gorge of my soul cried mr fenton the very gorge of my soul rises against this demon can nothing be done to bring him to punishment our parliament will surely interfere in such a calling exigence they will send to the several banks and take up all the deposits that have been made in his name alas sir said clement he was already aware of such possibilities and has entered all his lodgments in feigned names and to bearer upon demand  indeed continued clement i heartily wished at the time that the laws of the grecians and romans had been in force among us where the debtor was given up to be set to labor whipped or tortured at the pleasure of the creditor  god forbid god forbid exclaimed mr fenton  when we see mankind divided into the rich and the poor the strong and the weak the sound and the sickly we are apt to imagine that health strength or opulence was given to those and infirmity want or weakness appointed to these as marks of the peculiar favor or disfavour of providence  god however knows that there is nothing permanently good or evil in any of these things he sees that nothing is a good but virtue and that nothing is a virtue save some quality of benevolence on benevolence therefore he builds the happiness of all his intelligent creatures and in this our mortal state our short apparatus for a long futurity he has ordained the relative differences of rich and poor strong and weak sound and sickly etc to exercise us in the offices of that charity and those affections which reflecting and reflected like mutual light and warmth can alone make our good to all eternity  benevolence produces and constitutes the heaven or beatitude of god himself he is no other than an infinite and eternal good will benevolence must therefore constitute the beatitude or heaven of all dependent beings however infinitely diversified through several departments and subordinations agreeable to the several natures and capacities of creatures  god has appointed human power and human wealth as a ready and sufficient fund for human want and weakness to which fund therefore they have as good a right to resort as any other creditors have to respective trust or deposits for though poverty and weakness are not creditors by the laws of man they are creditors by the eternal laws of nature and equity and must here or hereafter bring their debtors to account  every man when he becomes a member of this or that society makes a deposit of three several sorts of trusts that of his life that of his liberty and that of his property  now as every man in his separate or independent state has by nature the absolute disposal of his property he can convey the disposal thereof to society as amply and absolutely as he was in his separate right entitled thereto  this however cannot be said of his life or of his liberty he has no manner of right to take away his own life neither to depart from his own liberty he cannot therefore convey to others a right and authority which he has not in himself  the question then occurs by what right it is that the legislative and executive powers of community appoint some persons to death and others to imprisonment my answer is short and follows  it is the right perhaps the duty of every man to defend his life liberty and property and to kill or bind the attempters this right he can therefore convey and on such conveyance it becomes the right and duty of the trustees of society to put to death or imprison all who take away or attempt the life liberty or property of any of its members  this right however extends to criminal matters only and it does not yet appear to me upon what reason or right rule founded in nature or policy the several societies of mankind have agreed to deliver up their members to slavery to stripes tortures or imprisonment for matters merely civil such as debts  several of the states of greece though accounting the rest of the world as barbarians and even the roman republic during the times of its most boasted policy and freedom gave up insolvent debtors without enquiring into the causes or occasions of such insolvency as slaves or absolute property into the hands of their creditors to be sold at will or put to labor or starved macerated or tortured in order to give value in vengeance which they could not give in coin or other equivalent commodities  the jewish or mosaic law though allowing sufficiently as christ says for the hardness of that peoples hearts yet gave perfect enlargement to all jews who were bondmen and perfect remission to all jews who were personal debtors on every seventh or sabbatical year and on every seventh sabbatical year or jubilee all prisons were thrown open all slaves though foreigners or aliens set at liberty and even the lands were enfranchised however mortgaged or laboring under debt and execution that all things animate or inanimate might have an earnest of that immunity and perfect freedom which god originally intended and keeps in store for his creatures  the laws of egypt permitted no member to deprive the public of the life liberty or labor of any other member except he were a criminal not fitting to live or to be suffered to walk at large in all cases of debtor and creditor they equitably appointed value for value as far as the substance of the debtor could reach and in case of insufficiency the insolvent party was obliged to leave in pledge the mummies or preserved bodies of his deceased ancestors till by industry or good fortune either he or his posterity should be enabled to redeem them a matter of refined as well as charitable policy as nothing was held more infamous among the egyptians than their inability to produce the mummies of their forefathers  the laws of holland by their late qualifications seem to acknowledge the iniquity or inadequateness of depriving a man of the possibility of earning merely because he has not an immediate ability to pay sensible therefore that all men are debtors to god and reciprocally debtors and creditors to each other they have ordained that he who imprisons an insolvent debtor shall pay the proper penalty of his malevolence or indiscretion by maintaining the party from whom he takes the ability of maintaining himself  it must be admitted that were our laws less severe with respect to debtors were people less afraid of a jail on failure of payment there would be less credit and consequently less dealing in this so wonderously wealthy and trading a nation but if our credit were less should not our extravagance lessen also should we see such princely tables among people of the lower class should so much claret spirits and ale intoxicate a kingdom should we see the value of a german princes ransom gorgeously attiring each of our belle dames if neither merchant butcher brewer laceman mercer milliner nor tailor would trust  many of our poor city dealers are yearly undone with their families by crediting persons who are privileged not to pay or whose remoteness or power places them beyond the reach of the law for by the return of non invent generally made upon writs one would be apt to imagine that no single subsheriff knew of any such thing as a man of fortune within his respective county throughout the kingdom of great britain  when i was last at paris i had the honor to be introduced to messieurs thimble and goose two tailors of quality in the course of conversation it happened to turn as usual on the dullness of the times the deadness of trade and delays of payment says monsieur thimble i had the misfortune to make interest for the new clothing of the last regiments that were transported to canada but interest was again to be made for the payment and before that could be done the officers were shipped off with greater value of my gold and silver on their backs than i am sure they carried of their own in their pockets ambition cried monsieur le goose ambition has brought me to the very brink of ruin i scorned to work for any thing under the degree of nobility and be poxd to me and the nobility are a sort of people whom we can never set our eyes on except at the time we are fitting on their clothes  before money became the medium of commerce the simple business of the world was carried on by truck or the commutation of one commodity for another but when men consented to fix certain rateable values upon money as a ready and portable equivalent for all sorts of effects credit was consequently introduced by the engagements of some to pay so much money in lieu of such commodities or to deliver such or such commodities on the advance of so much money and states found it their interest to support such public credit by enforcing the performance of said engagements  by the common law of england no person except the king could take the body of another in execution for debt neither was this prerogative of the crown extended to the subject till the statute of marlbridge chapter    in the reign of henry iii  many contract debts through vanity or intemperance or borrow money or take up goods with the intention of thieves and robbers never to make return when such suffer they suffer deservedly in expiation of their guilt but there are unavoidable damages by water by fire the crush of power oppressive landlords and more oppressive lawsuits death of cattle failure of crop failure of payment in others with thousands of such like casualties whereby men may become bankrupt and yet continue blameless and in all such cases one would think that the present ruin was sufficient calamity without the exertion of law to make that ruin irreparable  as all the members of a community are interested in the life liberty and labors of each other he who puts the rigor of our laws in execution by detaining an insolvent brother in gaol is guilty of a fourfold injury first he robs the community of the labors of their brother secondly he robs his brother of all means of retrieving his shattered fortune thirdly he deprives himself of the possibility of payment and lastly he lays an unnecessary burden on the public who in charity must maintain the member whom he in his cruelty confines  however since the severity of law is such that he whose misfortunes have rendered him insolvent must make satisfaction for so the savages esteem it by surrendering his body to durance for life it is surely incumbent on our legislators and governors to make the condition of the unhappy sufferers as little grievous as may be  but this most christian duty this most humane of all cares is yet to come when a debtor is delivered up into the phangs of his jailer he is consigned to absolute and arbitrary slavery and woe be to the wretch whose poverty may not have left him a sop for cerberus how more than miserable must be the state of those unhappy men who are shut in from all possible redress or appeal against the despotic treatment of their savage keepers whose hearts are habitually hardened to all sense of remorse and whose ears are rendered callous by incessant groans  we are credibly informed that it is usual with such keepers to amass considerable fortunes from the wrecks of the wretched to squeeze them by exorbitant charges and illicit demands as grapes are squeezed in a vine press while one drop remains and then to huddle them together into naked walls and windowless rooms having got all they can and nothing further to regard save the return of their lifeless bodies to their creditors  how many of these keepers exact from their distressed prisoners seven and eight shillings per week for rooms that would not rent at a third of that sum in any other part of this city at times nine of those wretched prisoners are driven to kennel together in a hovel fit only to stable a pair of horses while many unoccupied apartments are locked up from use even a sufficiency of the common element of water is refused to their necessities an advantage which the felons in newgate enjoy public and private benefactions are dissipated or disposed of at the pleasure of the keepers regardless of the intention or order of the donors and the apartments appointed to these miserable men are generally damp or shattered in the flooring and exposed by breach or want of windows to the inclemency of night air and all the rigor of the seasons  but what avail their complaints if the legislature have not authorized or made it the duty of some especial magistrates to examine into and redress these crying abuses  but tell me continued mr fenton were there any prisoners of consideration among the confined debtors a few sir of note and many who had been well to pass in the world among these indeed it was that every scene and species of misery was displayed there you might see as you have said numerous families of wretches whose thin and tattered garments but ill defended their shivering bodies from the inclemency of elements that blew through shattered windows or came pouring from unstaunched roofs  these people fared incomparably worse than those of the vulgar herd for being ashamed to beg at the grates they had nothing to subsist on save their scanty portion of such charities as happened to be sent in from time to time and this scarcely supplied them with a sufficiency of water black bread and offal while the recollection of their former affluence added sharp and bitter poignancy to the sense of their present wants  but here comes my pupil he will be more particular on scenes with which his heart was so meltingly affected  harry then entered with mrs clement caressing him on the one side and his old dependant ned hanging about him on the other  as soon as clement and his arabella had embraced and that all were settled and seated well harry said mr fenton will you favor us with some account of your expedition have you ever a pretty story for me my harry several stories sir said harry that were sweet pretty stories when i heard them but mr clement had better tell them they would be sadly bungled if they came through my hands dada the company will make allowances replied mr fenton let us have these stories in your own way harry just as your memory may happen to serve you  on the second day dada as my tutor and i were walking in the court yard of the fleet prison who should i spy but my old master mr vindex walking very sad to and again by the wall he was so pale and shabby and so fallen away that i did not rightly know him till i looked at him very earnestly my heart then began to soften and warm toward the poor man for it told me that something very sorrowful must have happened before he could have been brought to that condition so i went up to him with a face i believe as melancholy as his own  how do you do good mr vindex said i i should be glad to see you if i did not see you look so sad he then stared at me for some time and at length remembering me he looked concerned and turned away to shun me but i took him lovingly by the hand and said you must not leave me mr vindex will not you know your old scholar harry fenton yes says he casting down his mournful eyes i know you now master i know i used you basely and i know why you are come but reproach me and insult me as much as you please all is welcome now since i cannot lie lower till i am laid in the earth  i do not mean to insult you this tear will witness for me that i do not mean to insult you my dear mr vindex and so i wiped my eye here are twenty guineas to put warm clothes upon you in this cold weather little and low as i am myself i will try to do something better for you and so give me one kiss in token that we are friends  the poor dear man then opened his broad eyes in a wild stare upon me with a look that was made up half of joy and half of shame he then kneeled down as i supposed that i might reach to kiss him and taking me into his arms you are not born of woman you are an angel an angel he cried and so he fell a crying and cried so sadly that i could not for my heart but keep him company  i did all i could to pacify and make him cheerful and getting him up at last you must not part with me mr vindex said i we must dine and spend the day together here is mr clement my tutor you and he too must be friends  i then led him by the hand into a large ground room that mr close the chief keeper had appointed for us and i ordered dinner to be hastened and brought up as soon as we were all seated i began to laugh and joke after my foolish way in order to make poor mr vindex merry when i found that it would not do mr vindex said i be so kind to let me know what the money may come to for which you are confined a terrible sum indeed my darling said he no less than a hundred and fifty two pounds i then put my hand in my pocket and taking out two bills and a little matter of money that made up the sum i put it into his hand saying my friend shall never lie in gaol for such a trifle as this  having looked for some time at the bills with amazement he turned to my tutor with a doubtful and shamed face is this young gentleman sir said he duly authorized to dispose of such vast matters as these he is said mr clement he is the carver and disposer of his fathers fortune at pleasure and i am confident that his father will think himself doubly paid in the use that his noble son has made of his privilege this day  a gleam then like that of sunshine broke through his sad countenance as through the clouds of a dark day and are you the one he cried are you the one master harry whom i treated so barbarously you may forgive me my little cherubim you indeed may forgive me but i never i never shall forgive myself o mr vindex said i i would very nearly undergo the same whipping again to do you twice the kindness and make you love me twice as much as you now love me  dinner was now served and calling for wine i filled him a bumper in a large glass which he drank to the health of my glorious dada as he called you sir upon this we grew very merry and friendly among one another and when dinner was over i begged him to tell me how he came to be put into confinement  o master harry he cried i have suffered all that i have suffered very justly very justly for my harsh and cruel usage of you master harry  after the affair of the hobgoblins as you know the shame to which i was put by my fright and by my scourging began to be whispered and then to be noised about the town the boys at length catched the rumor and began to hoot at me and the more i chastised them the more they gathered about me and shouted after me a rod for the flogger a rod for the flogger  no disease is so deadly no blasting so baneful as contempt to a man in the way of his profession my boys grew disorderly and behaved themselves in school without respect to my person or regard to my government even my intimates shunned me and would cast at me a side glance of smiling scorn as they passed my school then melted from me like snow in a fog even my boarders forsook me i stood at a high rent my effects were seized by the landlord it was in vain that i solicited payment from the parents of my scholars no one who was indebted to me would give me a penny while all that i owed came like a tumbling house upon me and so i was cast into this prison from whence your bounty has set me free  my poor broken hearted wife would have accompanied me to gaol but as i had not wherewithal to give her a morsel of bread i sent her to an old aunt who had the humanity to take her in  alas alas poor mr vindex said i had i guessed any part of the mischiefs that our unlucky pranks have brought upon you i would have put both my hands into the furnace of nebuchadnezzar rather than have act or part in such a wickedness for herein we acted the fable of the frogs and the boys that which was play to us was death to you mr vindex  in conscience now we are indebted to you for every misfortune we caused you and as you are not yet paid for the half of your sufferings i here give you my hand and word to make up a hundred and fifty pounds more for you and for this i will not accept the smallest thanks as i think it is no more than an act of common honesty and i cried mr fenton i hold myself indebted to you a thousand pounds my noble harry for that single sentiment that is well that is well dada cried harry leaping up and clapping his hands i shall now be clear in the world with all my poor creditors  thus dada continued he it rejoiced my heart greatly to send poor mr vindex away in such triumph while my tutor and i went two or three doors off to see a mighty pretty young creature who was said to be confined with her ancient father and i will tell you their story with two or three other stories more on account of the incidents that happened while we were there than of any thing else that was wonderful or uncommon in them  on tapping at the door we were desired to walk in and saw a female with her back to us waving bone lace on a cushion while an elderly man with spectacles on read to her in thomas a kempis they both rose to salute us mr clement then stepped up and seeing what they were about cried god cannot but prosper your work good people since you employ your time to his purposes both on earth and in heaven as an earnest of his kindness to you he sends you by us a considerable charity which you shall receive as soon as you inform us who and what you are and how you came here blessed be the messengers of my god cried out the father whether they come with happy or with heavy tidings i say with old eli it is the lord let him do what seems him good  o dada i was quite charmed when the daughter turned to me there was such a sweetness such a heavenly harmlessness in her face that i could have kissed her and kissed her again and again  as i had brought a glass and the remainder of our bottle with me we all got about a board that was half stool and half table and after a round or two the good man began his story  my fathers name was samuel stern he had a clear estate of nine hundred and fifty pounds a year in sussex and had by my mother three daughters and four sons of whom i was the second  my father unhappily was a loyalist and when the troubles broke out between king charles and the parliament he took up all the money he could at any interest and raised a company at his own cost which he headed on the part of his royal master  after some successful skirmishes his head was split in two by the broadsword of a trooper at the battle of naisby immediately all our servants forsook us each carrying away with them whatever came to hand and quickly after the soldiers of the commonwealth came carried off all the cattle and left nothing of our house except the bare walls  in the mean time we poor children huddled together into the garden and there separating ran and crept under bushes and hedges as so many chickens endeavoring to gain shelter from the kite  as soon as the noise of the tumult was over we rose and looked about fearfully and getting together again we helped one another through the garden hedge and made as fast as we could to the cottage of a neighboring farmer who had been our fathers tenant here we were received coldly and fared but very hardly for that night on the next day however in order to get quit of us as i suppose the man went among our relations and prevailed on one to take a son and on another to take a daughter till we were all divided among them and so we entered on a kind of service to our kindred a service as i believe that is found on experience to be much harder and more insulting than any service to a stranger  i forgot to tell you gentlemen that our mother deceased before our father engaged in arms insomuch that we became orphans in all respects i fell to the share of an uncle by my mothers side he had a small estate of about a hundred and twenty pounds yearly income with one son and a daughter whom i thought very lovely  my uncle appointed me overseer of his laborers as also his occasional clerk for casting accounts and inditing his letters etc but when it was intimated to him that there was a secret liking between his daughter and me he called me aside and taking up a book of profane poems he kissed it and swore by the contents thereof that if ever i married his daughter he would not give us a groat  if you ever knew what love was said he to mr clement you must know that it breaks over stronger fences than these in short we were wedded and turned out of the house without any thing to live upon except about the value of twenty pounds in small matters which had been given to my wife from time to time by lady goodly her godmother  we made the best of our way to london my wife understood needlework and as i knew that my fatherinlaw was quite irreconcilable i joined myself to a house painter to whom i gave my time for nothing on condition of his giving me a sight into his business  in the third year my dear wife brought this poor creature into the world but happily she did not encumber mankind with any more of our wretched and depending progeny  all our care and delight was fixed on this our little daughter and we thought nothing of any pains or labors that might serve to introduce her like herself into the world  as soon as charles the iid had ascended the throne our relations were fully assured that we should be restored to our ancient rights and possessions and they contributed as it were for their own credit to set us forth in a suitable manner for appearing at court there accordingly we attended from time to time for the space of twelve months and got a number of woeful memorials presented to his majesty but his majesty was so deeply engaged in his pleasures or so fearful of offending the enemies of his house that he gave no attention to our wrongs there may also be something in the breasts of the great that excites them to acts of bounty rather than acts of justice for these as they apprehend might be accepted as matter of debt and not as matter of favor  being tired of a fruitless suit i returned to my former employment and by industry and frugality i lived with my little family quite happy and contented  about ten months ago two men came to our lodgings the one was in a rich livery and having enquired for my daughter presented her with a note to this effect  lady diana templar sends diana stern the enclosed bill of twenty five pounds in order to put her into some little way of livelihood  as my poor dear child had no cause to suspect any fraud or evil intention in the case she desired the men to return her most humble thanks and duty to her ladyship and away they went  as this lady was a distant relation of my wifes father my daughter in a few days dressed herself in her best and went to return thanks to her ladyship in person but was told that she was gone to her seat in the country  in the mean time she laid out her supposed bounty in furnishing a little front shop with some millinary wares and was already beginning to get some custom when one evening two bailiffs entered laid an action upon her and taking her up in their arms hurried her into a coach that drove up to the door  my wife and i had rushed out on hearing our child shriek and seeing a coach set off with her at a great rate we ran after as fast as we could shouting and screaming and crying stop the coach stop the coach a rape a rape at length a bold fellow who was passing caught one of the horses by the bridle and while the coachman lashed at him he took out his knife and cut the reins in two a mob then began to gather whereupon a well dressed man who was in the coach leaped out and made his escape but the coachman was not so lucky the people pulled him from the box and having beaten and kicked him they dragged him through the kennel  mean while we got our child out and then the mob overturned the coach and jumping upon it broke and dashed it all to pieces we then thought that we had nothing further to apprehend and taking our child between us we turned back and walked homeward but alas we were not permitted to enter the two bailiffs met us and producing their writ again arrested our daughter at the suit as they said of jonathan delvil esquire for the sum of twenty five pounds which he had lent her on such a day so they conducted her here while my wife and i accompanied her weeping and sobbing all the way  i then took these poor apartments to cover us from the weather and as my wife grew suddenly sick and faint i hastened back to our lodgings and had our bedding brought hither  it was now evident that the pretended gift of lady templar was no other than a diabolical scheme of the villain delvil to get the person of my darling within his fangs and i cursed my own stupidity for not perceiving it at first but blessed be my god however in all events that my lamb was still innocent was still unsullied  what with grief and the fright together my dear wife took to her bed from whence she never rose but expired on the fifth day blessing and pressing her daughter to her bosom my poor infant then fell as dead beside her mother and could not be recovered from her fit in many hours and indeed it was then the wish and the prayer of my soul that we might all be laid and forgotten in one grave together  as soon as my darling was recovered however i again wished to live for her sake that i might not leave her without a comforter or protector in the midst of a merciless and wicked world  in order to pay the nursekeeper the doctor and apothecary as also to defray the funeral expenses i left my child with the nursekeeper and going to our former lodgings i sold all her millinary matters at something under a third of prime cost and having discharged the lodgings and paid my gaol debts i prepared to lay my precious deposit in the womb of that earth which is one day to render her back incorruptible to eternity  when the corpse was carrying out at the door my child fell once more into fits and i was divided and quite distracted about what i should do whether to stay with the living or pay my duty to the dead but i will no longer detain you with melancholy matters since all worldly griefs with all worldly joys also must shortly be done away  as soon as i understood that lady templar was returnned to town i waited upon her and giving her an abridgment of our manifold misfortunes i produced the note that had been written in her name but she coldly replied that it was not her hand and that she was not answerable for the frauds or villainies of others  meanwhile my dear girl accused herself as the cause of all our calamities and pined away on that account as pale as the sheets she lay in she was also so enfeebled by her faintish and sick fits that she was not able to make a third of her usual earnings and as i on my part was also disqualified from laboring in my profession since i did not dare to leave my child alone and unsheltered we were reduced to a state of the greatest extremity  one day word was brought me that a gentleman a few doors off desired to speak with me and as they who are sinking catch at any thing for their support my heart fluttered in the hope of some happy reverse accordingly i followed the messenger his appearance in dress and person was altogether that of the gentleman  he ordered all others out of the room and requesting me to sit beside him in a half whispering voice he began i am come mr stern from one whom you have great reason to account your greatest enemy i come from mr delvil at whose suit your daughter now lies in prison i started  be patient sir he said he knows your distresses he knows all your wants he knows also that he is the author of them yet i tell you that he feels them as if they were his own and that it was not his enmity but his love that occasioned them  he depends on his old uncle dimmock for a vast fortune in expectation he saw your daughter and loved her he saw her again and loved her to madness he enquired her family her character and found that he had nothing to expect from any licentious proposal he feared however that all must love her as he did and to prevent other pirates he made use of the stratagem which contrary to his intentions has brought you here he never meant any thing dishonorable by your daughter had he carried her clear off you might all have been happy together at this day and if you consent he will marry her here in the presence of a few witnesses who shall be sworn to secrecy till his uncles death and he will instantly pay you down three hundred pounds in recompense for your sufferings and will settle one hundred pounds annuity on your child for life  i must own that to one in my circumstances this proposal had something very tempting in it but who is this mr delvil said i i know him not i never saw him  i am the man sir said he i would have discharged my action as i came to this place but i dare not permit your daughter to get out of my custody for at the loss of my fortune at the loss of my life i am determined that no other man living shall possess her i then promised him that i would make a faithful narration to my child of all that had passed but told him at the same time that i would wholly subscribe to her pleasure and so we parted  as soon as i represented this matter to my diana o no my papa she cried it is impossible it never can be i would do any thing suffer any thing but this for your relief would you act the marriage of the lamb and the wolf in the fable if such have been the consequences of this gentlemans affection for us what have we not to expect from the effects of his aversion i would prefer any kind of death to a life with such a man and then my mother she cried and burst into tears my dear mother whom he has murdered though he were worth half the world and would marry me publicly in the face of the other half it will not be it cannot be indeed my papa  hereupon i writ mr delvil almost a literal account of my daughters answer it is nearly five weeks since this happened and we have not heard any thing further from him  in this time however we got acquainted with a family at the next door whose converse has been a great consolation to us there is a father and mother with seven small children boys and girls they are very worthy people and of noble descent but how they contrive to live at all i cannot conceive for they have no visible means of making a penny had we not known them we should have thought ourselves the poorest of all creatures we must own them more deserving of your charity than we are  here poor mr stern ended and you cannot think dada how my heart leapt with love toward him on his recommending others as more deserving than himself so i resolved at once what to do and taking two  0 l notes from my pocketbook you shall not be under the necessity mr stern says i of marrying your pretty lamb here to the ugly wolf so here is fifty pounds to pay your action and fees and other small debts  on taking the note dada he looked at it very earnestly and when he saw it was a true note he opened his eyes and his mouth so wide and stood so stiff without stirring hand or foot that he put me in mind of lots wife who was turned into a pillar of salt however i did not seem to mind him but turning to his daughter and showing her the other note miss diana says i here is fifty pounds for you also in order to set you up in your little shop again but you shall not have it without a certain condition what condition master said she smiling the condition says i of putting your arms about my neck and giving me one or two sweet kisses she then looked earnestly at me with eyes swimming in pleasure and starting suddenly to me and catching me to her bosom she kissed my lips and my forehead and my head again and again and then set up as lamentable and loud a cry as if her father had lain a corpse before her  mr stern then lifted up his eyes and dropping on his knees o my god he cried how bountiful art thou to a wretch who is not worthy the least of all thy mercies hereupon the daughter turned and seeing the posture of her father she fell on her knees before him and throwing her arms about him he folded her in his also and they wept plentifully upon each other  how comes it dada that crying should be so catching however it be mr clement and i could not contain and i shall love him the better during life for the tears that he shed on that occasion  on hearing a smart rapping mr stern rose and opened the door where a footman almost breathless delivered him a letter the letter was to the purpose that mr delvil was ill of a quinsy that he had but a few hours to live and requested mr stern to bring his daughter to him that by marriage he might give her a lawful title to his fortune no papa cried diana living or dead nothing shall ever bribe me to give my hand to a man who has had a hand in the death of my dearest mother  mr clement however thought it advisable that mr stern should attend the messenger to see if mr delvil was really ill or whether this might not be some new contrived treachery  this was a day of successes to poor mr stern we had promised to stay with his diana till his return and he had not been long gone till some one tapped at the door i opened it and saw an exceeding old and reverend man he was dressed all in black and his white head looked like snow on the feathers of the raven is tom stern here said he no sir said i he is gone into town i thought he was a prisoner no sir it is not he but his daughter who is under confinement will you give a feeble old man leave to sit with you gentlemen and so down he sat come here to me child says he to diana are you a daughter of tom stern i am sir so please you and what was your mothers name anne roche sir but alas she is not living i was the cause of her death she broke her heart good sir on my being put to gaol i hope child said the old gentleman that you were not imprisoned for any thing that was naughty no sir no cried mr clement it was her honesty alone that brought and kept her here had she been less virtuous she might have been at liberty and flaunting about in her coach  the old man then put on his spectacles and ordering her to draw nearer he took a hand in each of his and looking intently in her face what is your name my dear said he diana honored sir that is a pretty and chaste name for an unchristian name indeed diana you are a sweet babe and the prettiest little prisoner that ever i saw i will pay all your debts and give you a thousand pounds over if you will come along with me and be my prisoner diana ah sir cried the girl it is too much to have broken the heart of one parent already i would not leave my dear father for any man with all the money in all the world you do not leave your father he cried by going with me diana i am your true father the father of nanny roche the father of her who bore you your own grandfather my diana  here she sunk on her knees between his knees begging and beseeching his blessing while his hands and eyes were lifted in prayer over her he then raised her and placing her gently on his knee clasped her in his aged arms while she threw hers about his neck and joining her cheek to his sobbed aloud and poured her tears into his bosom the old gentleman however did not express his concern by word or sob or even any change of his countenance and yet his tears fell fast down his reverend and delighted features upon his grandchild  this dada was a very pleasing though a very affecting sight as soon as the height of their passion was something abated miss diana turned her eye toward me and said you were pleased my grandpapa to promise that you would pay my debts but that is done already this angel here was sent to prevent all others and he further presented me with this bill of  0 l to set me up in a better shop than i kept before  i rejoice cried the old man i rejoice to find that so much of heaven is still left upon earth but you my diana are now in a condition rather to give charity than receive it from any your dear uncle jeremy who traded to the west indies lately died of the smallpox on his passage homeward you are the heir of his fortunes and the heir of my fortune you are the whole and sole lady of all our possessions but tell me how much did this young gentleman advance in your favor a hundred pounds sir  he then took out a bank note of a hundred pounds and having offered it to me i did not dare to refuse it for fear of offending the honor of the respectable old gentleman so i held it in my hand after a doubting manner my dear miss diana says i i will not be put to the pain of taking this back again but on the condition of your telling me to whom i shall give it o she cried out instantly to the babies to the sweet babies at the next door i wish to heaven i had as much more to add to it for their sakes  i then enquired the name of her favorite family at the next door and being told that it was ruth i looked over my list and found that mr ruth was in for above seven hundred pounds this grieved me very much as such a sum nearly amounted to the half of our whole stock however i comforted myself with the hope that god would send some one else to make up to this poor family what should be wanting on my part  mr stern just then returned i beg pardon said he gentlemen for detaining you so long but i could not avoid it the unhappy man is actually dying a very terrible death indeed in his full strength and almost in his full health stifling and gasping for air which the swelling of his glands will not suffer to pass  as soon as i entered he beckoned to me and put this paper sealed into my hand and again observing that i was agitated and deeply concerned for the state under which he labored he reached out his hand to me and grasping my right hand put this ring upon my finger  this paper contains under his hand and seal a discharge of the action which he laid upon my daughter as also a conveyance to us of the cash notes enclosed amounting to three hundred pounds in consideration as he recites of our losses and unjust sufferings and so my dear master fenton i here return you your  00 l with all possible acknowledgments and a sense of the obligation that will never leave me during life  sir said i you must excuse me i am already paid that gentleman yonder compelled me to accept of the very sum you offer  mr stern then started and turning he saw his uncle and eying him inquisitively at length recollected who he was he then stepped up and falling on his knees before him o sir he cried your pardon your pardon it is all i presume to ask i dare not hope for your blessing  tom said the old gentleman i wanted to be even with you i wanted to seduce your daughter as you seduced mine but your daughter tom though come of very rebellious parents would not be seduced howsomever as i have taken a liking to her she must come along with me whether she will or no and as jacob said to joseph concerning ephraim and manasseh she shall be mine and not thine tom and my name and the name of my fathers shall be named upon her according to her inheritance but if you have any affection for this my child tom and are unwilling to part with her you may follow her and welcome  soon after we got up and having congratulated this happy family on the blessing of their meeting and reconciliation i stepped to the old gentleman and catching him about the neck tenderly took my leave of him as i did also of mr stern but when i went to take leave of the fair diana she drew some steps backward and her eyes and sweet features beginning to swell she again run forward and catching me in her dear arms o my darling my darling my darling she cried am i then going to lose you it may be never to see you more were it but once in a week in a month in a year to behold you even that would keep me alive for all the remainder o my best my most generous my first preserver it is you who might be the seducer who might make me and others to run after you barefoot but if we must part my little angel do but promise to know me in heaven and there your poor diana will meet you never to part any more  what could i say or do dada in answer to the dear girl my heart swelled almost to bursting while she caressed and wept over me at length with words as well as my tears would give me leave to pronounce them i demanded the name of the place to which she was going and promised to pay her a visit as soon as possibly i could we then parted very melancholy notwithstanding all our success and going out i wiped my eyes and begged mr clement to order tea and coffee with a comfortable entertainment for the family at the next door while i should go in and introduce myself as well as i could  having tapped gently at the door it was opened by a little ragged boy of about five years old mrs ruth sat full in my view and her three little daughters stood before her while she examined them in the old testament questions of who was the first man and the wisest man and the strongest man and the oldest man and above all the man after gods own heart  mrs ruth was a fine woman and had a great deal of humbled dignity about her i bowed to her as i entered and going familiarly up i took her by the hand and kissed it allow me madam said i to introduce a little neighbor to you i lodge within a few doors and shall think myself happy in being acquainted in your family alas my dear says she there are very few who seek acquaintance with calamity they who wish to relieve it seek acquaintance with it madam  having eyed me all over with an earnest kind of surprise you look my love said she to be very goodnatured and i dare say will be very charitable when you come to have the ability the little ability i have madam shall be strained for your service in the mean time pray pardon the freedom i have taken in ordering tea and coffee into your room with some cakes and sweetmeats for these pretty misses i will only trouble you madam with one guest more it is mr clement my tutor who good man has been no stranger to poverty or distress  here she called mr ruth from an inner room give me leave my dear says she to introduce a young stranger to you from what world he comes i know not but i am sure that he is not wholly of the world that we have lived in  mr ruths countenance spoke at once the meekness of moses and the patience of job having saluted we both sat down mr ruth said i i have a message to you and your lady from your sweet pretty neighbor miss diana stern in token of her respect and affection for you she presents you with this cash note of a hundred pounds diana stern cried out mr ruth why master she is nearly as poor as ourselves by no means sir i assure you her grandfather is come to town she is worth several thousands besides a considerable estate to which she is heiress o the dear creature the dear angel cried mrs ruth i will instantly go and pay her my acknowledgments so up she got and out she run before i could prevent her  as soon as she was gone mr ruth says i my dada is much fonder of me than i deserve he has given me a little money to dispose of at pleasure among the confined debtors and though i may not have enough to answer your occasions yet my dada is so very good and so very generous that if you give me the sum of your debts with the story of your distresses his heart i am sure will melt and he will set you clear in the world  he made no answer however to this my offer but lifting up his eyes he cried well might thou say great savior of the simple suffer little children to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven o thou babe of the manger thou first born of many brethren here indeed is a dear and true little brother of thine but he speaks in his simplicity and not according to knowledge then turning toward me can you guess my darling said he what you undertake to do for me i question if the charities of all this nation would be sufficient when united to effect my deliverance nothing nothing but the arm of the almighty can do it he will do it indeed in death but what then shall become of my wife and seven infants that truly is terrible is worse than death to think of  while we were speaking two sweet little fellows came in the eldest very nearly of my size but both clad in very thin and poorlooking apparel having kneeled for their fathers blessing they slipped behind us and turning my head to observe them i was quite ashamed and drew it back again on perceiving that the poor things were unlading their pockets of old crusts and broken meats which i supposed they had begged for the family  mrs ruth just then returned and her countenance looked something dejected she took her seat by her husband and continuing a while silent she put her handkerchief before her eyes and began in broken words can you guess my dear said she what sort of a creature this is whom we have got among us this little heavenly impostor to lighten our obligation would have persuaded us that the hundred pounds was the gift of another but it is all his own bounty it is all his own graciousness come my daughters come my children kneel down and return your thanks to this your patron your benefactor your little father here  o dada you would have pitied me sadly had you seen me at that time the poor dear things came all in a cluster pressing and catching and clasping and clinging about me while my love and my very heart was torn as it were to fritters among them so i took them one by one in my arms and kissed and embraced them very cordially calling them my brothers and sisters i then took out another hundred pound note and giving it to the eldest of the daughters here my dear said i i always loved the little misses better than the little masters here is for yourself and your sisters to clothe you in a way more becoming your family and then taking a note of equal value i gave it to the eldest son for himself and his brothers as i said to help to educate them in a manner more agreeable to the house from whence they came  mr and mrs ruth looked so astonished at me and at each other that for a while they were not able to utter a syllable and just as they began to make their acknowledgments i cried hush hush here comes my tutor  mr clement just then entered followed by several servants who carried a tea equipage cold fowl baked meats with other pastries and some wine  having introduced mr clement we all got round the table and after tea and a further regale i besought mr ruth to give us the story of his misfortunes  my father said he was baron of frankford he left my brother with the title four thousand five hundred pounds a year entailed however upon me in case of his dying without male issue and he left me a small inheritance of four hundred pounds yearly to support in some measure the appearance of a gentleman  as my concern bordered on my brothers estate we saw one another every day and continued for several years in strait and tender amity  being both invited one day to dine with other company at the house of a neighbor called mr heartless a question happened to be started over the bottle whether the method of setting an egg on end was originally the invention of columbus or whether it was communicated to him by some other and i unhappily espoused the opinion that was opposite to that of my brother  now though the question was not worth the very shell of the egg about which we debated yet we entered as warmly into it as though a province had lain at stake for it is not truth or instruction that disputants seek after it is victory alone that is the object of their contention  after some warm words and personal retorts had passed between my brother and me he started into sudden passion and gave me the lie whereupon reaching across the table i gave him a tap on the cheek with the flat of my fingers then rising furiously from his seat he swore a fearful oath and cried i will ruin you harry though it cost me my estate i will ruin you harry ruth with all who are yours  the very next day he mustered his tenants and laborers and coming upon me with a little army he laid most of my fences level with the earth  when i complained of this violence to my next neighbors mr heartless and mr hollow they protested they would stand by me against such outrageous proceedings to the last of their fortunes they then advanced me between them five hundred pounds for the purpose i immediately commenced suit against my lords tenants but though i cast them all with costs i unhappily found that nearly all my money was sunk in the contest  meantime scarce a day passed wherein i was not served with a subpoena from chancery to answer such or such a bill to which my brother had procured me to be made a party and he also entered a suit against me himself in order to invalidate my fathers will whereby i claimed my little patrimony  when i told this to my friend mr hollow he broke into a loud laugh your title cried he the world cannot invalidate your title mr ruth i will let you have a thousand pounds upon it to morrow and this i was under the necessity of accepting soon after  contention serves with mutual hands to shut every door against reconciliation the more i had loved my brother the more i now detested him instead of any submission or overture to appease him my lips uttered in daily invectives the overflowings of my heart as i also was assured that on his part he wished me nothing less than eternal perdition thus we burned on both sides with unquenchable fire and the kingdom of satan was fully opened within us  at length my body was imprisoned at the suit of my neighbor heartless for   0 l and my lands were taken under execution at the suit of my neighbor hollow for the sum of  000 l but i soon was informed that all this money was my brothers who had advanced it from time to time to those his clandestine correspondents in order to hasten and deepen my destruction when i understood this i raged i was all on fire and i took a horrid pleasure in the notion of having the fangs of a tiger that i might tear my brother piecemeal and my false friends limb from limb and feast my spirit on their pangs and mine eyes on their carnage  but when i turned a look on my wife and seven infants grief joined with rage to tear me by a double distraction i cursed the lot to which i was appointed upon earth and i should have sought some desperate means of putting an end to my torments and existence together but that i dreaded by my death to give pleasure to my brother ten times more than i dreaded the pain of death itself  o my friends had all that ever were sainted come and preached to me the peace of our lord christ at that season it would have been no more than beating the air or striving with so many spunges to make an impression on a block of marble it is distress alone that by oppression makes impression that preaches the internal doctrine of sensible mortification and humbles a proud spirit by plucking away all its props  at first i was as a worm under the foot of my god i turned and struggled and writhed and fought with all my force against the crusher but alas all was in vain he was too mighty for me and opposition served only to add to my anguish  at length i was compelled to acquiesce rather through the want of power than the want of will to resist and i lay as it were without motion under his dispensations at the same time that my heart reproached him in secret  having sold all our movables and even our wearing apparel for sustenance we were reduced to the necessity of sending our eldest boys to beg fragments of victuals at kitchen windows to keep us from utterly famishing this i held to be such a further shame and disgrace as stung my soul to the quick i therefore began to kick against these pricks also but finding that the more i spurned the stronger i was held and pressed into the dust i gave up all resistance and contented myself with grieving and weeping under the hand of the almighty  from hence i gradually sunk into a state of resigned serenity which although without sunshine was yet without disturbance my fury smoothed its crest my passions subsided and i felt nothing more of rancour against my brother or resistance against my god  the activity of the soul will find itself employment as i had now no further prospect or concern upon earth i began to turn my thoughts and attention toward heaven i locked myself into yonder closet i threw myself into the dust i have sinned i cried i have greatly sinned o god i am nothing i am crushed even lower than the nothing that i am spare spare me from a deeper perdition i beseech thee  i felt that my prayer was heard peace descended upon me like dew upon the night theday star began gradually to dawn to my soul the dark kingdom of satan gave way before the kingdom of the son of light and love and i would no more have entertained any one of my former passions than i would have taken burning coals and have buttoned them up in my bosom  i was greatly delighted dada with this part and some more of mr ruths story and i got him to repeat it over and over that i might remember it the better  i now continued he i now pitied my brother as much as ever i had hated him i grieved for having caused the loss of his peace i wished to restore it to him i wrote a penitential acknowledgment of my faults i besought his pardon in the humblest manner for the unfortunate blow i subscribed to the justice of my consequent sufferings and i sent my son here to attend his lordship with my lowly address  the triumph which this humiliation gave to my brother supplied him with patience to go through my memorial but then conceiving as i suppose that it was dictated by mercenary meanness and hypocrisy he tore it to pieces and dashed it into the fire then returning to my child the box which had so enflamed the soul of his lordship he kicked my poor little fellow out of his house  my child came home to me weeping sadly but i consoled him the best i could and mingled my tears with his not in any resentment for the treatment received but through grief for the inveteracy of my unhappy brother o my god i cried i no longer repine at my abasement at the weight of my sufferings and mortifications i bless thee for them o god they have proved my best friends my most salutary physicians cruel and stern indeed is the porter who stands at the iron gate of pain but o it opens upon regions of inward delight for he who clothed himself with the cross is all glorious within  my happy experience of this truth opened for me a new prospect into the mystery of gods dispensation to mortals and threw a number of shining lights on those very articles of gospelredemption which had formerly appeared to me so exceptionable and gloomy if god said i to myself has suffered man to fall he has also provided for him every possible means of recovery and restoration  wherefore when sin came into the world god also sent suffering its inseparable attendant to be a cure and an antidote to the poison thereof if sin therefore has thrust the kingdom of heaven from within us suffering comes as gods forerunner it relaxes and unfolds the brazen gates of our polluted temple that christ our righteousness may enter the very hem of whose garment is salvation to every soul that lays hold upon it  here i took mr ruth about the neck and kissing him said that i was sure my dada would be willing to pay his whole debt in return for the sweet instructions which he had given to his harry you speak of your dada my dear said he as though he were the representative of god in the gospel who forgave to his servant ten thousand talents what you have given me already master is beyond any human bounty that ever i heard of i shall therefore lay by two of these notes till i am better informed how far your good father may be satisfied with the donation  soon after we took leave for the present of this honorable family we then went among the other principal debtors whose distresses indeed were great though their stories except one had little singular in them in order to make our money go as far as we could we hurried here and there through the town compounding with the several creditors from eight to ten and twelve and fifteen shillings in the pound so that for about six hundred pounds we discharged a number who were indebted to the amount of a thousand  on tuesday about noon in the last week i stepped to mr ruths to see if the family had been decently clad agreeable to my request there i found him and his four sons clothed in warm and clean though very coarse apparel and he told me that his wife had gone abroad with her three daughters in order to put them also into a suitable condition  while i sat with him a young woman came in of a very genteel appearance though in a plain dress dont you remember the girl sir said she to mr ruth who used to come to you over night in a green kerchief and a little red mantle i should be very ungrateful indeed said he if any change of dress could conceal from my remembrance that sweet and charitable countenance o sir she cried the few shillings that i brought you from time to time came from a very affectionate hand though from a hand you would little suspect of any affection toward you they came from your loving niece belinda ruth who has shed many a shower of tears on your misfortunes may heaven be her portion cried out the good man since earth has nothing equal to so much goodness indeed sir continued the girl the little that your niece sent you was procured with much difficulty and danger to herself for from the time that on her knees and with a deluge of tears she petitioned her father in your behalf he kept a watchful eye over her and took from her all family trusts so that she had nothing wherewith to supply you except the price of some cast gowns and of other little matters that she feigned to have lost moreover my lord swore vehemently that if ever she furnished you with the value of a farthing or kept any kind of correspondence with you or with yours he would disown and turn her into the public streets  you alarm me greatly cried out mr ruth is any thing amiss has any thing happened to my dear child she was a lovely little lamb a little angel from her cradle though i should not know her now if she stood erect before me i hope i say  tell me  proceed i beseech you  there was a servant sir a man whom your niece thought very faithful and therefore entrusted with the secret of my coming to you that he might attend and see me safe back again this fellow presuming on the confidence that was placed in him would this morning have taken indecent liberties with his young mistress this she resented in a becoming manner and threatened to complain of his insolence to her father the revengeful villain instantly ran and told the affair to his lord with many aggravations as though his daughter was robbing him of all his substance thereupon she was hastily called and having in part confessed the charge my lord drew his sword in his fury whereupon giving a shriek and a sudden spring she got out of his presence and has sent me to know sir if you will be pleased to receive her  yes cried mr ruth to my bosom to my heart with the same pleasure and welcome that a convict receives pardon on the hour of execution  just then mrs ruth entered with her three daughters who running up to their father dropped together on their knees before him for a blessing  while his hands and eyes were raised in prayer over them the young stranger stepped earnestly up and falling on her knees beside the daughters she broke into tears and cried aloud bless me bless me also o my father i am your niece your belinda my father is no more yours my lord is the title yours all the possession i now in my turn depend on your bounty for a morsel of bread my brother my brother dead exclaimed mr ruth he is my lord she replied he was suffocated by his rising choler and expired on the spot  while the young lady spoke mrs ruth looked as quite terrified by the tidings of such a sudden elevation and clapping her hands together and lifting her eyes she cried it cannot be it is impossible ours the title ours the fortune  o my god  o my husband  o my children  and down she dropped  end of the third volume just
