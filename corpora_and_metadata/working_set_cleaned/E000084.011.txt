james warren to james warren mount vernon   october      dear sir the assurances of your friendship after a silence of more than six years are extremely pleasing to me friendship formed under the circumstances that ours commenced are not easily eradicated and i can assure you that mine has undergone no diminution every occasion therefore of renewing it will give me pleasure and i shall be happy at all times to hear of your welfare the war as you have very justly observed has terminated most advantageously for america and a fair field is presented to our view but i confess to you freely my dear sir that i do not think we possess wisdom or justice enough to cultivate it properly illiberality jealousy and local policy mix too much in all our public councils for the good government of the union in a word the confederation appears to me to be little more than a shadow without the substance and congress a nugatory body their ordinances being little attended to to me it is a solecism in politics indeed it is one of the most extraordinary   things in nature that we should confederate as a nation and yet be afraid to give the rulers of that nation who are the creatures of our making appointed for a limited and short duration and who are amenable for every action and recallable at any moment and are subject to all the evils which they may be instrumental in producing sufficient powers to order and direct the affairs of the same by such policy as this the wheels of government are clogged and our brightest prospects and that high expectation which was entertained of us by the wondering world are turned into astonishment and from the high ground on which we stood we are descending into the vale of confusion and darkness that we have it in our power to become one of the most respectable nations upon earth admits in my humble opinion of no doubt if we would but pursue a wise just and liberal policy towards one another and keep good faith with the rest of the world that our resources are ample and increasing none can deny but while they are grudgingly applied or not applied at all we give a vital stab to public faith and shall sink in the eyes of europe into contempt it has long been a speculative question among philosophers and wise men whether foreign commerce is of real advantage to any country that is whether the luxury effeminacy and corruptions which are introduced along with it are counterbalanced by the convenience and wealth which it brings with it but the decision of this question is of very little importance to us we have abundant reason to be   convinced that the spirit for trade which pervades these states is not to be restrained it behoves us then to establish just principles and this any more than other matters of national concern cannot be done by thirteen heads differently constructed and organized the necessity therefore of a controlling power is obvious and why it should be withheld is beyond my comprehension the agricultural society lately established in philadelphia promises extensive usefulness if it is prosecuted with spirit i wish most sincerely that every state in the union would institute similar ones and that these societies would correspond fully and freely with each other and communicate all useful discoveries founded on practice with a due attention to climate soil and seasons to the public    it would afford me great pleasure to go over those grounds in your state with a mind more at ease than when i travelled them in      and      and to unite in congratulating on the happy change with those characters who participated of the anxious moments we passed in those days and for whom i entertain a sincere regard but i do not know whether to flatter myself with the enjoyment of it the deranged state of my affairs from an absence and total neglect of them for almost nine years and a pressure of other matters allow me little leisure for gratifications of this sort mrs washington offers her compliments and best wishes to mrs warren to which be pleased to add those of dear sir yours c   george washington    october      mount vernon patrick henry to patrick henry governor of virginia mount vernon    october      sir your excellency having been pleased to transmit to me a copy of the act appropriating to my benefit certain shares in the companies for opening the navigation of james and potomac rivers i take the liberty of returning to the general assembly through your hands the profound and grateful acknowledgments inspired by so signal a mark of their beneficent intentions towards me i beg you sir to assure them that i am filled on this occasion with every sentiment which can flow from a heart warm with love for my country sensible to every token of its approbation and affection and solicitous to testify in every instance a respectful submission to its wishes with these sentiments in my bosom i need not dwell on the anxiety i feel in being obliged in this instance to decline a favor which is rendered no less flattering by the manner in which it is conveyed than it is affectionate in itself in explaining this observation i pass over a comparison of my endeavors in the public service with the many honorable testimonies of approbation which have already so far overrated and overpaid them reciting one consideration only which supersedes the necessity of recurring to every other when i was first called to the station with which i was honored during the late conflict for our liberties to the diffidence which i had so many reasons to feel in accepting it i thought it my duty to join a firm resolution to shut my hand against every pecuniary   recompense to this resolution i have invariably adhered and from it if i had the inclination i do not feel at liberty now to depart whilst i repeat therefore my fervent acknowledgments to the legislature for their very kind sentiments and intentions in my favor and at the same time beg them to be persuaded that a remembrance of this singular proof of their goodness towards me will never cease to cherish returns of the warmest affection and gratitude i must pray that their act so far as it has for its object my personal emolument may not have its effect but if it should please the general assembly to permit me to turn the destination of the fund vested in me from my private emolument to objects of a public nature it will be my study in selecting these to prove the sincerity of my gratitude for the honor conferred on me by preferring such as may appear most subservient to the enlightened and patriotic views of the legislature with great respect and consideration i have the honor to be c    george washington  0 november      mount vernon george william fairfax to george william fairfax mount vernon  0 november      my dear sir       the two youngest children of mr custis—the oldest a girl of six years—the other a boy a little turned of four live with me they are both promising children but the latter is a remarkable fine one—and my intention is to give him a liberal education the rudiments of which shall if i live be in my own family—having promised this let me next my good sir ask if it is in your power conveniently to engage a proper preceptor for him—at present and for a year or two to come much confinement would be improper for him but this being the period in which i should derive more aid from a man of letters and an accomptant than at any other to assist me in my numerous correspondences and to extricate the latter from the disordered state into which they have been thrown by the war i could usefully employ him in this manner until his attention should be more immediately required for his pupil— fifty or sixty pounds sterling pr ann with board lodging washing and mending in the family is the most my numerous expenditures will allow me to give   but how far it may command the services of a person well qualified to answer the purposes i have mentioned is not for me to decide to answer my purposes the gentleman must be a master of composition and a good accomptant—to answer his pupils he must be a classical scholar and capable of teaching the french language grammatically—the more universal his knowledge is the better— it sometimes happens that very worthy men of the cloth come under this description men who are advanced in years and not very comfortable in their circumstances such an one if unencumbered with a family would be more agreeable to me than a young man just from college—but i except none of good moral character answering my description if he can be well recommended— to you my dr sir i have offered this my first address but if you should think my purposes cannot be subserved in your circle upon the terms here mentioned i beg in that case that you will be so obliging as to forward the enclosed letter as it is directed—this gentleman has written to me upon another subject  favored me with his lucubrations upon education which mark him a man of abilities at the same time that he is highly spoken of as a teacher and a person of good character in scotland we all know that education is cheap and wages not so high as in england—but i would prefer on account of the dialect an englishman to a scotchman for all the purposes i want   we have commenced our operations on the navigation of this river and i am happy to inform you that the difficulties rather vanish than increase as we proceed—james river is under similar circumstances and a cut between the waters of albermarle in no carolina and elizabeth river in this state is also in contemplation—and if the whole is effected and i see nothing to prevent it it will give the greatest and most advantageous inland navigation to this country of any in the union—or i believe in the world—for as the shannondoah the south branch monocasy and conogocheague are equally capable of great improvement they will no doubt be immediately attempted and more than probable a communication by good roads will be opened with the waters to the westward of us by means of the no branch of potomac which interlocks with the cheat river and yohoghaney branches of the monongahela that empty into the ohio at fort pitt—the same is equally practicable between james river and the greenbriar a branch of the great kanhawa which empties into the same river  00 miles below that place by means whereof the whole trade of that territory which is now unfolding to our view may be drawn into this state—equally productive of political as commercial advantages as i never ride to my plantations without seeing something which makes one regret having continued so long in the ruinous mode of farming which we are in i beg leave tho i am persuaded it will give you trouble to recall your attention to the request of my   former letter the duplicate of which you now have—miscarriages and where this is not the case delays of letters must be my apology for reiterating the matter that there may be time for decision before the intervention of another year the marriage mentioned in my last is celebrated but a fit of the gout prevented colo bassett from beeing at it—consequently i am to lay a little longer out of your kind present mrs washington who has very indifferent health joins me in the sincerest and best wishes for every blessing which can be bestowed on mrs fairfax and yourself with great esteem c p s since writing the above  foregoing i have seen mr battaile muse who looks after your estate  upon enquiry of him am authorized to inform you that your negroes and everything under his care are tolerably well  your prospect of a crop midling which is saying a good deal this year i have the pleasure also to inform you that your brother and his family were very well a few days ago when i was there attending the business of the potomac company at the great falls your sister and family are likewise well—i saw her three oldest daughters last week—the elder of them milly is on the eve of matrimony with a mr ogden throckmorton—a match not very agreeable it is said to her friends  kept off by mrs bushrod till her death which happened some three or four months ago—but now is yielded to by her parents  0 george washington  0 november      mount vernon lund washington to lund washington mount vernon  0 november      dear lund i know as little of g ws plans or wishes as you do never having exchanged a word with him upon the subject in my life—by his advertisement and from what has frequently dropped from fanny he is desirous of getting a place in this country to live at— before their marriage he and fanny were both told that it would be very agreeable to mrs w and myself that they should make this house their home till the squalling and trouble of children might become disagreeable—i have not repeated the matter since because it was unnecessary—an offer once made is sufficient—it is hardly to be expected that two people young as they are with their nearest connexions at extreme points would like confinement—and without it he could not answer my purposes as a manager or superintend unless i had more leisure to attend to my own business which by the by i shall aim at let the consequences in other respects be as they may these however are no reasons for detaining you a moment longer in my employ than suits your interest or is agreeable to your inclination and family concerns but as the proposition is new and hath never been resolved in my mind it will take some time to digest my own thoughts upon the occasion before it is hinted to another in the mean while if i can do with the aids you offer and for which i sincerely thank you i will ask    your constant attention no longer than this year—at any rate not longer than the next—the inexplicitness of this answer cannot i presume put you to much if any inconvenience as yet because retirement from  not a change of business is professedly your object— however unlucky i may have been in crops c of late years i shall always retain a grateful sense of your endeavors to serve me—for as i have repeatedly intimated to you in my letters from camp nothing but that entire confidence which i reposed could have made me easy under an absence of almost nine years from my family and estate or could have enabled me consequently to have given not only my time but my whole attention to the public concerns of this country for that space i am c  george washington  0 november      mount vernon james madison to james madison mount vernon  0 november      dear sir receive my thanks for your obliging communications of the   th i hear with much pleasure that the assembly are engaged seriously in the consideration of the revised laws a short and simple code in my opinion though i have the sentiments of some of the gentlemen of the long robe against me would be productive of happy consequences and redound to the honor of this or any country which shall adopt    a code so short plain  simple i hope the resolutions which were published for the consideration of the house respecting the reference of congress for the regulation of a commercial system will have passed  the proposition in my opinion is so selfevident that i confess i am unable to discover wherein lies the weight of objection to the measure we are either a united people or we are not so if the former let us in all matters of general concern act as a nation which has a national character to support if we are not let us no longer act a farce by pretending to it for whilst we are playing a double game or playing a game between the two we never shall be consistent or respectable but may be the dupes of some powers and the contempt assuredly of all in any case it behoves us to provide good militia laws and to look well to the execution of them but if we mean by our conduct that the states shall act independently of each other it becomes indispensably necessary for therein will consist our strength and the respectability of the union     it is much to be wished that public faith may be held inviolable painful is it even in thought that attempts should be made to weaken the bands of it it is a dangerous experiment once slacken the reins and the power is lost and it is questionable with me whether the advocates of the measure foresee all its consequences it is an old adage that honesty is the best policy this applies to public as well as private life to states as well as individuals i hope the port and assize bills no longer sleep but are awakened to a happy establishment the first with some alterations would in my judgment be productive of great good to this country without it the trade thereof i conceive will ever labor and languish with respect to the second if it institutes a speedier administration of justice it is equally desirable    from the complexion of the debates in the pennsylvania assembly it should seem as if that legislature intended their assent to the proposition from the states of virginia and maryland respecting a road to the youghiogany should be on the condition that permission be given by the latter to open a communication between the chesapeake and delaware by the way of the rivers elk and christiana which i am sure will never be obtained if the baltimore interest can give effectual opposition the directors of the potomac navigation have sent to the delegates of this county to be laid before the assembly a petition which sets forth the reasons for relief in the depth of the canals which it may be found necessary    to open at the great and little falls of the river as public economy and private interest equally prompt the measure and no possible disadvantage that we can see will attend granting the prayer of it we flatter ourselves no opposition will be given to it to save trouble to expedite the business and to obtain uniformity without delay or an intercourse between the two assemblies on so trifling a matter we have taken the liberty of sending the draft of a bill to members of both assemblies which if approved will be found exactly similar with the greatest esteem and regard i am dear sir c george washington    december      mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton mount vernon    december      dear sir i have been favored with your letter of the   th of november by major farlie sincerely do i wish that the several state societies had or would adopt the alterations that were recommended by the general meeting in may     —i then thought and have had no cause since to change my opinion that if the society of the cincinnati mean to live in peace with the rest of their fellow citizens they must subscribe to the alterations which were at that time adopted that the jealousies of and prejudices against this society were carried to an unwarrantable length i will readily grant and that less than was done ought to have removed the fears which had been imbibed i am as clear in as i am that it would not have    done it but it is a matter of little moment whether the alarm which seized the public mind was the result of foresight—envy and jealousy—or a disordered imagination the effect of perseverance would have been the same wherein there would have been found an equivalent for the separation of the interests which from my best information not from one state only but from many would inevitably have taken place the fears of the people are not yet removed they only sleep and a very little matter will set them afloat again had it not been for the predicament we stood in with respect to the foreign officers and the charitable part of the institution i should on that occasion as far as my voice would have gone have endeavored to convince the narrowminded part of our countrymen that the amor patriæ was much stronger in our breasts than theirs—and that our conduct through the whole of the business was actuated by nobler and more generous sentiments than were apprehended by abolishing the society at once with a declaration of the causes and the purity of its intention but the latter may be interesting to many and the former is an inseparable bar to such a step  i am sincerely concerned to find by your letter that the baron is again in straightened circumstances—i    am much disinclined to ask favors of congress but if i knew what the objects of his wishes are i should have much pleasure in rendering him any services in my power with such members of that body as i now and then corrispond with—i had flattered myself from what was told me some time ago that congress had made a final settlement with the baron much to his satisfaction    george washington    december      to the trustees of the alexandria academy    december      gentlemen that i may be perspicuous and avoid misconception the proposition which i wish to lay before you is committed to writing and is as follows it has long been my intention to invest at my death one thousand pounds current money of this state in the hands of trustees the interest only of which to be applied in instituting a school in the town of alexandria for the purpose of educating orphan children who have no other resource or the children of such indigent parents as are unable to give it the objects to be considered of and determined by the    trustees for the time being when applied to by the parents or friends of the children who have pretensions to this provision it is not in my power at this time to advance the above sum but that a measure that may be productive of good may not be delayed i will until my death or until it shall be more convenient for my estate to advance the principal pay the interest thereof to wit fifty pounds annually under this state of the matter i submit to your consideration the practicability and propriety of blending the two institutions together so as to make one seminary under the direction of the president visitors or such other establishment as to you shall seem best calculated to promote the objects in view and for preserving order regularity and good conduct in the academy my intention as i have before intimated is that the principal sum shall never be broken in upon the interest only to be applied for the purposes abovementioned it was also my intention to apply the latter to the sole purpose of education and of that kind of education which would be most extensively useful to people of the lower class of citizens namely reading writing and arithmetic so as to fit them for mechanical purposes the fund if confined to this would comprehend more subjects but if you shall be of opinion that the proposition i now offer can be made to comport with the institution of the school which is already established and approve of an incorporation of them in the manner before mentioned and thereafter upon a full consideration of the matter should conceive    that this fund would be more advantageously applied towards clothing and schooling than solely to the latter i will acquiesce in it most cheerfully and shall be ready as soon as the trustees are established upon a permanent footing by deed or other instrument of writing to vest the aforesaid sum of one thousand pounds in them and their successors for ever with powers to direct and manage the same agreeably to these my declared intentions       george washington   february      mount vernon benjamin lincoln to benjamin lincoln mount vernon   february      my dear sir your favor of the  th of january never reached me till yesterday or the receipt of it should have had an earlier acknowledgment let me in the first place thank you for your kind attention to my inquiries and in the next pray you to know precisely from mr lear upon what terms he would come to me i am not inclined to leave matters of this kind to after discussion or misconception whatever agreement is previously made shall be pointedly fulfilled on my part which will prevent every cause of complaint on his mr lear or any other who may come into my family in the blended characters of preceptor to the children and as a clerk or private secretary to me will sit at my table will live as i live will mix with the company who resort to the house and will be    treated in every respect with civility and proper attention he will have his washing done in the family and may have his linen and stockings mended by the maids of it the duties which will be required of him are generally such as appertain to the offices above mentioned the first will be very trifling till the children are a little more advanced and the latter will be equally so as my correspondences decline which i am endeavoring to effect and after my accounts and other old matters are brought up to descend more minutely into his avocations i am unable because occasional matters may call for particular services but nothing derogatory will be asked or expected after this explanation of my wants i request mr lear would mention the annual sum he will expect for these services and i will give him a decided answer by the return of the stages which now carry the mail and travel quick a good hand as well as a proper diction would be a recommendation on account of fair entries and for the benefit of the children who will have to copy after it     george washington  0 march      mount vernon samuel purviance to samuel purviance esq mount vernon  0 march      sir your letter of the  th instant is this moment put into my hands was it in my power i would cheerfully answer your queries respecting the settlements  0 on the kanhawa the nature of the water and quality of the soil but of the first i only know from information that colo lewis is settled there from his own mouth i learnt that it was his intention to do so  to establish a town in the fork of the two rivers where he proposes to fix families in the vicinity on his own lands of the second i never could obtain any distinct account of the navigation it has been variously represented favorably by some—extremely difficult by others in its passage thro the gauley mountain which i presume is the laurel hill—but the uncertainty of this matter will now soon be at an end as there are commissioners appointed by this state to explore the navigation of that river and the communication between it and james river with a view to a portage this equally with the extension of the potomac navigation was part of my original plan and equally urged by me to our assembly for my object was to connect the western and eastern or atlantic states together by strong commercial ties i am a friend therefore on this principle to every channel that can be opened and wish the people to have choice—the kanhawa and james river if the obstacles in the former are not great are certainly the shortest and best for the settlers thereon for those on the ohio below above perhaps as high as the little kanhawa and for the country immediately west of it the monongahela and yohoghaney with the potomac are most convenient for all the settlers from the    little kanhawa inclusively to fort pitt and upwards  west as far as the lakes susquehanna and the alleghany above fort pitt some distance will accommodate a third district of country and may for ought i know be equally convenient to the trade of the lakes all of them therefore have my best wishes for as i have observed already my object  my aim are political if we cannot bind those people to us by interest and it is no otherwise to be effected but by a commercial knot we shall be no more to them after a while than g britain or spain and they may be as closely linked with one or other of those powers as we wish them to be with us and in that event they may be a severe thorn in our side with respect to the nature of the soil on the kanhawa the bottoms are fine but the lands adjoining are broken—in some places the hills are very rich in others piney and very poor but the principal reason as i conceive why the settlement has not progressed more is that the greater part if not all the good lands on the main river are in the hands of persons who do not incline to reside thereon themselves and possibly hold them too high for others as there is a surrounding country open to them this i take to be my own case and might be an inducement to concur in any well concerted measures to further a settlement which might ultimately not at too great a distance subserve my interest in that quarter the great kanhawa is a long river with very little interruption for a considerable distance—no very large waters empty into it i believe elk river coal    river and a creek called pokitellico below the falls and green river above them are the most considerable i am glad to hear that the susquehanna canal is so well advanced i thank you for the offer of mr nielsons services in the western country and am with very great c george washington   st march      mount vernon cols fitzgerald gilpin to cols fitzgerald and gilpin mount vernon   st march      gentn yesterday mr brindley in company with a mr harris manager for the james river company the latter having been sent for the former by the directors thereof left this on their way to richmond from whence mr brindley expects to be returned as far as alexandria in seven days from the date hereof i have engaged him to call upon colo gilpin on his rout back mr brindley  and mr harris took the great falls in their way down and both approve of the present line for our canal—the first very much he conceives that   0ths of the expence of the one fifth proposed will be saved by this cut the work altogether as secure and the entrance into the river by no means unfavorable he thinks however that a good deal of attention and judgment is required in fixing locks there the height of which he observes is always governed by the ground—they frequently run from four to eighteen feet and some times are as high as twenty four    the nature and declination of the ground according to him is alone to direct—and where this will admit he thinks the larger the locks are made the better because more convenient with respect to this part of the business i feel and always have confessed an entire incompetency—nor do i conceive that theoretical knowledge alone is adequate to the undertaking locks upon the most judicious plan will certainly be expensive and if not properly constructed and judiciously placed may be altogether useless it is for these reasons therefore that i have frequently suggested though no decision has been had the propriety of employing a professional man nevertheless whether the expense of obtaining one in and bringing him from europe has been thought unnecessary or too burthensome for the advantages which are to be expected i know not but as it is said no person in this country has more practical knowledge than mr brindley i submit to your consideration the propriety of engaging him to take the falls in his way back to examine level and digest a plan for locks at that place if it shall appear good and his reasons in support of the spots and sizes conclusive it will justify the adoption if palpably erroneous there is no obligation upon us to follow him and the expence in that case is the only evil which can result from it—this for the chance of a probable good i am not only willing but desirous of encountering and if colo gilpin has not already made the trip to that place which he proposed at our last visit and disappointment there it    would give me great pleasure if it could be so timed as to accompany mr brindley this would not only give countenance to the measure but aid also and might serve to remove the little jealousies which otherwise arise in the minds of our own managers taking mr brindley to the works now may ultimately save expence—at the same time having a plan before us enable us at all convenient times to provide materials for its execution i am c p s if my proposition is acceded to it would be better to fix at once what mr brindley is to receive and i will readily subscribe my name to what you two gentlemen shall agree to give him george washington    april      mount vernon robert morris to robert morris mount vernon    april      dear sir i give you the trouble of this letter at the instance of mr dalby of alexandria who is called to philadelphia to attend what he conceives to be a vexatious lawsuit respecting a slave of his which a society of quakers in the city formed for such purposes have attempted to liberate the merits of this case will no doubt appear upon trial from mr dalbys state of the matter it should seem that this society is not only acting repugnant to justice so far as its conduct concerns strangers but in my opinion extremely impoliticly with respect to the state the city in particular and without being able but by acts of tyranny and oppression to accomplish its own ends he says the conduct    of this society is not sanctioned by law had the case been otherwise whatever my opinion of the law might have been my respect for the policy of the state would on this occasion have appeared in my silence because against the penalties of promulgated laws one may guard but there is no avoiding the snares of individuals or of private societies and if the practice of this society of which mr dalby speaks is not discountenanced none of those whose misfortune it is to have slaves as attendants will visit the city if they can possibly avoid it because by so doing they hazard their property or they must be at the expense and this will not always succeed of providing servants of another description for the trip i hope it will not be conceived from these observations that it is my wish to hold the unhappy people who are the subject of this letter in slavery i can only say that there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than i do to see a plan adopted for the abolition of it but there is only one proper and effectual mode by which it can be accomplished and that is by legislative authority and this as far as my suffrage will go shall never be wanting but when slaves who are happy and contented with their present masters are tampered with and seduced to leave them when masters are taken unawares by these practices when a conduct of this sort begets discontent on one side and resentment on the other and when it happens to fall on a man whose purse will not measure with that of the society and he loses his property for want of means to defend it it is oppression in such a    case and not humanity in any because it introduces more evils than it can cure i will make no apology for writing to you on this subject for if mr dalby has not misconceived the matter an evil exists which requires a remedy if he has my intentions have been good though i may have been too precipitate in this address mrs washington joins me in every good and kind wish for mrs morris and your family and i am c george washington  0 may      mount vernon marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette mount vernon  0 may      my dear marquis       the letter which you did me the favor to write to me by mr barrett dated the  th of february together with the parcel and packages which accompanied it came safely to hand and for which i pray you to accept my grateful acknowledgments the account of and observations which you have made on the policy and practice of great britain at the other courts of europe respecting these states i was but too well informed and convinced of before unhappily for us though their accounts are greatly exaggerated yet our conduct has laid the foundation for them it is one of the evils of democratical governments that the people not always seeing and frequently misled must often feel before they can act right but then evils of this nature seldom fail to work their own cure it is to be lamented nevertheless    that the remedies are so slow and that those who may wish to apply them seasonably are not attended to before they suffer in person in interest and in reputation i am not without hopes that matters will take a more favorable turn in the federal constitution the discerning part of the community have long since seen the necessity of giving adequate powers to congress for national purposes and the ignorant and designing must yield to it ere long several late acts of the different legislatures have a tendency thereto among these the impost which is now acceded to by every state in the union though clogged a little by that of new york will enable congress to support the national credit in pecuniary matters better than it has been whilst a measure in which this state has taken the lead at its last session will it is to be hoped give efficient powers to that body for all commercial purposes this is a nomination of some of its first characters to meet other commissioners from the several states in order to consider of and decide upon such powers as shall be necessary for the sovereign power of them to act under which are to be reported to the respective legislatures at their autumnal sessions for it is to be hoped final adoption thereby avoiding those tedious and futile deliberations which result from recommendations and partial concurrences at the same time that it places it at once in the power of congress to meet european nations upon decisive and equal ground all the legislatures which i have heard from have come into the proposition and have made very judicious appointments     much good is expected from this measure and it is regretted by many that more objects were not embraced by the meeting a general convention is talked of by many for the purpose of revising and correcting the defects of the federal government but whilst this is the wish of some it is the dread of others from an opinion that matters are not yet sufficiently ripe for such an event  the british still occupy our posts to the westward and will i am persuaded continue to do so under one    pretence or another no matter how shallow as long as they can of this from some circumstances which had occurred i have been convinced since august      and gave it as my opinion at that time if not officially to congress as the sovereign at least to a number of its members that they might act accordingly it is indeed evident to me that they had it in contemplation to do this at the time of the treaty the expression of the article which respects the evacuation of them as well as the tenor of their conduct since relative to this business is strongly marked with deception i have not the smallest doubt but that every secret engine is continually at work to inflame the indian mind with a view to keep it at variance with these states for the purpose of retarding our settlements to the westward and depriving us of the fur and peltry trade of that country your assurances my dear marquis respecting the male and female asses are highly pleasing to me i shall look for them with much expectation and great satisfaction as a valuable acquisition and important service the jack which i have already received from spain in appearance is fine but his late royal master tho past his grand climacteric cannot be less moved by female allurements than he is or when prompted can proceed with more deliberation and majestic solemnity to the work of procreation—the other jack perished at sea the benevolence of your heart my dear marquis is so conspicuous upon all occasions that i never  0 wonder at any fresh proofs of it but your late purchase of an estate in the colony of cayenne with a view of emancipating the slaves on it is a generous and noble proof of your humanity would to god a like spirit would diffuse itself generally into the minds of the people of this country but i despair of seeing it some petitions were presented to the assembly at its last session for the abolition of slavery but they could scarcely obtain a reading to set them afloat at once would i really believe be productive of much inconvenience and mischief but by degrees it certainly might and assuredly ought to be effected and that too by legislative authority i give you the trouble of a letter to the marquis de st simon in which i have requested to be presented to m de menonville the favorable terms in which you speak of mr jefferson gives me great pleasure he is a man of whom i early imbibed the highest opinion i am as much pleased therefore to meet confirmations of my discernment in these matters as i am mortified when i find myself mistaken    george washington    may      mount vernon john jay to john jay mount vernon    may      dear sir in due course of post i have been honored with your favors of the  d and   th of march  since which i have been a good deal engaged and pretty much from home for the enclosure which accompanied    the first i thank you mr littlepage seems to have forgot what had been his situation forgot what was due to you and indeed what was necessary to his own character and his guardian i think seems to have forgotten every thing  i coincide perfectly in sentiment with you my dear sir that there are errors in our national government which call for correction loudly i would add but i shall find myself happily mistaken if the remedies are at hand we are certainly in a delicate situation but my fear is that the people are not yet sufficiently misled to retract from error to be plainer i think there is more wickedness than ignorance mixed in our councils under this impression i scarcely know what opinion to entertain of a general convention that it is necessary to revise and amend the articles of confederation i entertain no doubt but what may be the consequences of such an attempt is doubtful yet something must be done or the fabric must fall for it certainly is tottering ignorance and design are difficult to combat out of these proceed illiberal sentiments improper jealousies and a train of evils which oftentimes in republican governments must be sorely felt before they can be removed the former that is ignorance being a fit soil for the latter to work in tools are employed by them which a generous mind would disdain to use and which nothing but time and their own puerile or wicked productions can show the inefficacy and dangerous    tendency of i think often of our situation and view it with concern from the high ground we stood upon from the plain path which invited our footsteps to be so fallen so lost it is really mortifying but virtue i fear has in a great degree taken its departure from our land and the want of a disposition to do justice is the source of the national embarrassments for whatever guise or colorings are given to them this i apprehend is the origin of the evils we now feel and probably shall labor under for some time yet with respectful compliments to mrs jay and sentiments of sincere friendship i am dear sir c george washington  0th may      mount vernon henry l charton to henry l charton mount vernon  0th may      sir the letter which you did me the favor to write to me from philadelphia on the  th inst came safely to hand and i should have given it an earlier acknowledgment had not frequent calls from home  unavoidable business prevented it i do not perceive upon recurring to the subject that i can be more explicit in the description of my lands on the big kanhawa  on the ohio between the two kanhawas than i was when i had the pleasure of seeing you at this place—if i recollect rightly i then informed you that from the accounts given me of them by the surveyor from what i had seen of them myself especially the tract on the big kanhawa from every other source of information  from    my best knowledge  belief there can be no finer land in that or any other country or lands more abounding in natural advantages the whole of them are washed by the rivers i have mentioned—are furnished with land streams fit for water works of various kinds—stored with meadow ground wch may be reclaimed in the cheapest  most expeditious manner imaginable by only cutting away trifling banks of earth which have been formed by the beaver and abound in fish  wild fowl of all kinds as well as every other sort of game with which the country is filled with respect to the quality of the soil it may be conceived that none can exceed it when i relate a single fact namely that it was the first choice of the whole country thereabouts after a thorough research of it by an excellent judge the late colo crawford as to the situation of them none can be more advantageous for living about midway between the upper  lower settlements on the ohio the trade must pass within sight of those lands whilst the occupants of them equally convenient to both might embrace the inland navigation of either potomac or james river as soon as they are made to communicate with the western waters which no doubt will soon be effected i think too i should not be mistaken were i to add that ere long a town of some importance will be established in the vicinity of them—viz—at the confluence of the big kanhawa  ohio which is the point at which the trade to richmond  that which is carried to the northern parts of this state     to maryland  pennsylvania must separate but to go into a more minute detail in writing of what has before been the subject of oral conversation would be more tiresome than interesting especially as it is by no means my wish that any purchase whatever—should rely upon my accot of this matter or on those of any others—but judge for himself or themselves in all things when you asked me if i was disposed to sell these lands i answered and truly that i had never had it in contemplation because i well knew they would rise more in value than the purchase money at the present time would accumulate by interest consequently under these circumstances it would be difficult in the present moment to fix on a price which would be acceded to that would be an equivalent for them hereafter however as i had no family wished to live easy  to spend the remainder of my days with as little trouble as possible i said i would part with them if a good price could be obtained and that my sense of their value might easily be ascertained by the terms on which i had proposed to rent them  which i think you told me you had seen one of which amounting in fact to an absolute sale being on a lease of     years renewable was at ten pounds this currency per hundred acres which at   p ct—the legal interest in this state would have come to  0s like money pr acre for the land on purchase but i added that if any one person or sett of men would take the whole i would make the terms of payment easy and abate considerably in the price i    therefore now inform you that the lands the patents  plats of which i shewed you the titles to which are uncontrollable—free from those clashing interests and jarring disputes with which much of the property in that country is replete are in quantities  situation as follows—  st—     on the ohio river three or four miles below the mouth of the little kanhawa  d—     acres on the said river abt sixteen miles below the former  d—     acres on ditto just above the great bend in it  below the other two  th— 0  0—on the big kanhawa west side beginning within two or three miles of its conflux with the ohio  extending up the former    miles  th—     acres a little above this on the east side of the same river kanhawa  th— 000 acres higher up the kanhawa west side in the fork between coal river and it  th—   0 acres opposite thereto on the east side in all       acres on both rivers for these lands i would take thirty thousand english guineas of the proper weight or other specie current in the country at its equivalent value—two thousand five hundred of which to be paid at the execution of the deeds  the remainder in seven years therefrom with an interest of five pr ct pr ann regularly paid at my seat till the principal shall be discharged i am not inclined to part with any of these lands as an inducement to settle the rest my mind is so    well satisfied of the superior value of them to most others that there remains no doubt on it of my obtaining my own terms as the country populates and the situation  local advantages of them unfold these terms have already been promulgated but i have not a copy of them by me or i could send it to you they were inserted in dunlaps  claypooles gazette about two years ago at whose office it is probable a copy might be had —one of the conditions was if my memory serves me an exemption from the payment of rent three years whilst the tenements were opening  improvements making this i am still inclined to fulfill the rents were different according to the term for which leases were to be granted if for twenty one years only they were to commence  end at £  pr hundred for in that case the stipulated improvements being made i knew that almost any rent might be had for the tenement thereafter if on leases renewable every ten years forever the rents were in that case to advance in a certain ratio to keep pace with the encreasing value of the land and if given in the first instance for     yrs as has been mentioned before then the rent was to commence at ten pounds pr hund acres which being in fact an alienation of the property shewed my ideas of its present value  purchase money as mentioned already these as far as i can recite from memory were the terms on which i offered to rent and from which i feel no disposition to relax unless as in the    case of a purchase some one or more persons would take the whole off my hands at once  become responsible for the rent in which case being influenced by similar principles i might abate accordingly i should have great pleasure in giving such letters as you have asked to the marquis de la fayette and chevr de la luzerne but conceive they could only have an embarrassing operation it is certainly as consistent with the policy of one country to discourage depopulation as it is for another to encourage emigration considering the matter in this point of view i cannot suppose however well disposed either of the above gentlemen may be to serve this country that they would do it at the expence of  perhaps hazard of censure from their own one of these gentlemen too being in the diplomatic or ministerial line would undoubtedly be very cautious in expressing a sentiment favorable to a business of this kind—my best wishes however will follow you thro all the stages of it and with esteem i am c p s i shoud be glad to know whether this letter found you in philadelphia george washington   june      mount vernon james tilghman to james tilghman mount vernon   june      dear sir i have just had the honor to receive your favor of the   th ulto— of all the numerous acquaintances of your lately deceased son   amidst all the sorrowings that are mingled on that melancholy occasion i may venture    to assert that excepting those of his nearest relatives none could have felt his death with more regret than i did because no one entertained a higher opinion of his worth or had imbibed sentiments of greater friendship for him than i had done that you sir should have felt the keenest anguish for this loss i can readily conceive—the ties of the parental affection united with those of friendship could not fail to have produced this effect it is however a dispensation the wisdom of which is inscrutable and amidst all your grief there is this consolation to be drawn—that while living no man could be more esteemed and since dead none more lamented than colo tilghman as his correspondence with the comtee of new york is not connected with any transactions of mine so consequently it is not necessary that the papers to which you allude should compose part of my public documents but if they stand single as they exhibit a trait of his public character and like all the rest of his transactions will i am persuaded do honor to his understanding and probity it may be desirable in this point of view to keep them alive by mixing them with mine which undoubtedly will claim the attention of the historian—who if i mistake not will upon an inspection of them discover the illiberal ground on which the charge mentioned in the extract of the letter you did me the honor to inclose me is founded—that a calumny of this kind had been reported i knew—i had laid my acct for the calumnies of annonymous scribblers but i never before had conceived    that such an one as is related could have originated with or have met the countenance of capt asgill whose situation often filled me with the keenest anguish i felt for him on many accts and not the least when viewing him as a man of honor  sentiment how unfortunate it was for him that a wretch who possessed neither should be the means of causing in him a single pang or a disagreeable sensation my favorable opinion of him however is forfeited if being acquainted with these reports he did not immediately contradict them—that i could not have given countenance to the insults which he says were offered to his person especially the grovelling one of erecting a gibbet before his prison window will i expect readily be believed when i explicitly declare that i never heard of a single attempt to offer an insult and that i had every reason to be convinced that he was treated by the officers around him with all the tenderness and every civility in their power—i would fain ask captn asgill how he could reconcile such belief if his mind had been seriously impressed with it to the continual indulgencies and procrastinations he had experienced he will not i presume deny that he was admitted to his parole within ten or twelve miles of the british lines—if not to a formal parole to a confidence yet more unlimited—by being permitted for the benefit of his health and recreation of his mind to ride not merely about the cantonment but into the surrounding country for many miles with his friend and companion maj gordon constantly attending him would not these indulgencies have pointed  0 a military character to the portrait from whence they flowed did he conceive that discipline was so lax in the american army as that any officer in it would have granted these liberties to a person confined by the express order of the commander in chief unless authorized to do so by the same authority and to ascribe them to the interference of count de rochambeau is as void of foundation as his other conjectures for i do not recollect that a sentence ever passed between that general and me directly or indirectly on the subject i was not without suspicions after the final liberation and return of capt asgill to new york that his mind had been improperly impressed or that he was defective in politeness the treatment he had met with in my conception merited an acknowledgment—none however was offered and i never sought for the cause this concise acct of the treatment of capt asgill is given from a hasty recollection of the circumstances—if i had had time and it was essential by unpacking my papers and recurring to authentic files i might have been more pointed and full it is in my power at any time to convince the unbiased mind that my conduct through the whole of the transaction was neither influenced by passion guided by inhumanity or under the control of any interference whatsoever i essayed everything to save the innocent and bring the guilty to punishment with what success the impartial world must and hereafter certainly will decide with very great esteem c     george washington    june      mount vernon henry lee to henry lee in congress mount vernon    june      my dear sir       the advantages with which the inland navigation of the rivers potomac and james are pregnant must strike every mind that reasons upon the subject but there is i perceive a diversity of sentiment respecting the benefits and the consequences which may flow from the free and immediate use of the mississippi my opinion of this matter has been uniformly the same and no light in which i have been able to consider the subject is likely to change it it is neither to relinquish nor to push our claim to this navigation but in the mean while to open all the communications which nature has afforded between the atlantic states and the western territory and to encourage the use of them to the utmost in my judgment it is a matter of very serious concern to the wellbeing of the former to make it the interest of the latter to trade with them without which the ties of consanguinity which are weakening every day will soon be no bond and we shall be no more a few years hence to the inhabitants of that country than the british and spaniards are at this day not so much indeed because commercial connexions it is well known lead to others and united are difficult to be broken and these must take place with the spaniards if the navigation of the mississippi is opened clear i am that it would be for the interest of the western settlers as low down the ohio as the big kanhawa and back to the lakes to bring their produce    through one of the channels i have named but the way must be cleared and made easy and obvious to them or else the ease with which people glide down stream will give a different bias to their thinking and acting whenever the new states become so populous and so extended to the westward as really to need it there will be no power which can deprive them of the use of the mississippi why then should we prematurely urge a matter which is displeasing and may produce disagreeable consequences if it is our interest to let it sleep it may require some management to quiet the restless and impetuous spirits of kentucky of whose conduct i am more apprehensive in this business than i am of all the opposition that will be given by the spaniards  mrs washington  george and his wife join me in compliments and good wishes to your lady with great esteem and regard i am dear sir c    george washington    july      mount vernon william grayson to william grayson in congress mount vernon    july      dear sir is it not among the most unaccountable things in nature that the representation of a great country should generally be so thin as not to be able to execute the functions of government  to what is this    to be ascribed is it the result of political manœuvre in some states or is it owing to supineness or want of means be the causes what they may it is shameful and disgusting in a word it hurts us our character as a nation is dwindling and what it must come to if a change should not soon take place our enemies have foretold for in truth we seem either not capable or not willing to take care of ourselves for want i suppose of competent knowledge of the connecticut claim to western territory the compromise which is made with her appears to me to be a disadvantageous one for the union and if her right is not one of the motives according to your account for yielding to it in my humble opinion is exceedingly dangerous and bad for upon such principles might not right must ever prevail and there will be no surety for any thing     i wish very sincerely that the land ordinance may answer the expectations of congress i had and still have my doubts of the utility of the plan but pray devoutly that they may never be realized as i am desirous of seeing it a productive branch of the revenue that part which makes the waters and carryingplaces common highways and free for all the states is certainly valuable i thank you for the other articles of information such as you have disclosed confidentially you may rest assured will proceed no further till it becomes public through other channels and this shall always be the case with paragraphs which are so marked the answer to the memorial of mr adams by lord carmarthen i have seen at large it was impolitic and unfortunate if it was not unjust in these states to pass laws which by fair construction might be considered as infractions of the treaty of peace it is good policy at all times to place ones adversary in the wrong had we observed good faith and the western posts had then been withheld from us by great britain we might have appealed to god and man for justice and if there are any guarantees to the treaty we might have called upon them to see it fulfilled  but now we cannot do this though clear i am that the reasons assigned by the british ministry    are only ostensible and that the posts under one pretence or another were intended to have been detained though no such acts had ever passed but how different would our situation have been under such circumstances with very sincere regard and affection i am dear sir c george washington july      mount vernon wakelin welch to wakelin welch esq mount vernon—july      sir since my last of the   th of novr i have been favored with your letters of the   th of feby    th of march and have receivd the paper hangings and watch by capt andrews with the last mrs washington is well pleased and i thank you in her name for your attention to the making of it if the stocks keep up and there is not a moral certainty of their rising higher in a short time it is my wish and desire that my interest in the bank may be immediately sold and the money arising therefrom made subject to my drafts in your hands some of which at  0 days sight may soon follow this letter the footing on which you have placed the interest of my debt to you is all i require to stand on equal ground with others who owe money to the merchants in england and who were not so prompt in their payment of the principal as i have been is all i aim at whatever the two countries may finally decide with respect to interest or whatever general agreement or compromise may be come to between british creditors    and american debtors i am willing to abide by nor should i again have touched upon this subject in this letter had you not introduced a case which in my opinion has no similitude with the point in question you say i have received interest at the bank for the money which was there—granted—but besides remarking that only part of this money was mine permit me to ask if g britain was not enabled by means of the bank to continue the war with this country whether this war did not deprive us of the means of paying our debts and whether the interest i received from this source did or could bear any proportion to the losses i sustained by having my grain my tobacco and every article of produce rendered unsaleable and left to perish on my hands however i again repeat that i ask no discrimination of you in my favor for had there been no stipulation by treaty to secure debts—nay more had there even been an exemption by the legislative authority or practice of this country against it i would from a conviction of the propriety and justice of the measure have discharged my original debt to you but from the moment our ports were shut and our markets were stopped by the hostile fleets and armies of great britain till the first were opened and the others revived i should for the reasons i have tho very cursorily assigned have thought the interest during that epocha stood upon a very different footing i am much obliged by the trouble you have taken to enquire into the nature of the connexion between    the house of messrs hanbury  co and balfour  barrand i had no sanguine hopes of redress from that quarter but as it seemed to be the only chance i was willing to try it i am c george washington   august      mount vernon chevalier de la luzerne to the chevalier de la luzerne mount vernon   august      dear sir the letter you did me the honor to write to me on the  d of february has come safely to hand nothing could be more satisfactory to me than the friendly sentiments contained in it and the generous manner in which you always interest yourself in the happiness and dignity of the united states i wish i had it in my power to inform you that the several states had fully complied with all the wise requisitions which congress has made to them on national subjects but unfortunately for us this is not yet the case although for my own part i do not cease to expect that this just policy will ultimately take effect it is not the part of a good citizen to despair of the republic nor ought we to have calculated that our young governments would have acquired in so short a period all the consistency and solidity which it has been the work of ages to give to other nations all the states however have at length granted the impost though unhappily some of them have granted it under such qualifications as have hitherto prevented its operation the greater part of the union seems to be convinced of the necessity of federal measures and of investing    congress with the power of regulating the commerce of the whole the reasons you offer on this subject are certainly forcible and i cannot but hope will ere long have their due efficacy  in other respects our internal governments are daily acquiring strength the laws have their fullest energy justice is well administered robbery violence or murder is not heard of from new hampshire to georgia the people at large as far as i can learn are more industrious than they were before the war economy begins partly from necessity and partly from choice and habit to prevail the seeds of population are scattered over an immense tract of western country in the old states which were the theatres of hostility it is wonderful to see how soon the ravages of war are repaired houses are rebuilt fields enclosed stocks of cattle which were destroyed are replaced and many a desolated territory assumes again the cheerful appearance of cultivation in many places the vestiges of conflagration and ruin are hardly to be traced the arts of peace such as clearing rivers building bridges and establishing conveniences for travelling are assiduously promoted  0 in short the foundation of a great empire is laid and i please myself with a persuasion that providence will not leave its work imperfect i am sensible that the picture of our situation which has been exhibited in europe since the peace has been of a very different complexion but it must be remembered that all the unfavorable features have been much heightened by the medium of the english newspapers through which they have been represented the british still continue to hold the posts on our frontiers and affect to charge us with some infractions of the treaty on the other hand we retort the accusation what will be the consequences is more than i can predict to me however it appears that they are playing the same foolish game in commerce that they have lately done in war that their illjudged impositions will eventually drive our ships from their ports wean our attachments from their manufactures and give to france decided advantages for a commercial connexion with us to strengthen the alliance and promote the interests of france and america will ever be the favorite object of him who has the honor to subscribe himself with every sentiment of attachment dear sir c george washington   august      mount vernon thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson mount vernon   august      dear sir the letters you did me the favor to write to me on the  th and  th of january have been duly received in answer to your obliging inquiries respecting    the dress attitude c which i would wish to have given to the statue in question i have only to observe that not having sufficient knowledge in the art of sculpture to oppose my judgment to the taste of connoisseurs i do not desire to dictate in the matter on the contrary i shall be perfectly satisfied with whatever may be judged decent and proper i should even scarcely have ventured to suggest that perhaps a servile adherence to the grab of antiquity might not be altogether so expedient as some little deviation in favor of the modern costume if i had not learnt from colonel humphreys that this was a circumstance hinted in conversation by mr west to mr houdon this taste which has been introduced in painting by west i understand is received with applause and prevails extensively    we have no news of importance and if we had i should hardly be in the way of learning it as i divide my time between the superintendence of opening the navigation of our rivers and attention to my private concerns indeed i am too much secluded from the world to know with certainty what sensation the refusal of the british to deliver up the western posts has made on the public mind i fear the edge of its sensibility is somewhat blunted federal measures are not yet universally adopted new york which was as well disposed a state as any in the union is said to have become in a degree antifederal some other states are in my opinion falling into very foolish and wicked plans of emitting paper money i cannot however give up my hopes and expectations    that we shall ere long adopt a more just and liberal system of policy what circumstances will lead or what misfortunes will compel us to it is more than can be told without the spirit of prophecy in the mean time the people are industrious economy begins to prevail and our internal governments are in general tolerably well administered you will probably have heard of the death of general greene before this reaches you in which case you will in common with your countrymen have regretted the loss of so great and so honest a man  general mcdougall who was a brave soldier and a disinterested patriot is also dead  he belonged to the legislature of his state the last act of his life was after being carried on purpose to the senate to give his voice against the emission of a paper currency    colonel tilghman who was formerly of my family died lately and left as fair a reputation as ever belonged to a human character thus some of the pillars of the revolution fall others are mouldering by insensible degrees may our country never want props to support the glorious fabric with sentiments of esteem and regard i have the honor to be c george washington   august      mount vernon john jay to john jay mount vernon   august      dear sir i have to thank you very sincerely for your interesting letter of the   th of june as well as for the other communications you had the goodness to make at the same time i am sorry to be assured of what indeed i had little doubt before that we have been guilty of violating the treaty in some instances what a misfortune it is the british should have so well grounded a pretext for their palpable infractions and what a disgraceful part out of the choice of difficulties before us are we to act your sentiments that our affairs are drawing rapidly to a crisis accord with my own what the event will be is also beyond the reach of my foresight we have errors to correct we have probably had too good an opinion of human nature in forming our confederation experience has taught us that men will not adopt and carry into execution measures the best calculated for their own good without the intervention of a coercive power i do not conceive we can    exist long as a nation without having lodged some where a power which will pervade the whole union in as energetic a manner as the authority of the state governments extends over the several states to be fearful of investing congress constituted as that body is with ample authorities for national purposes appears to me the very climax of popular absurdity and madness could congress exert them for the detriment of the public without injuring themselves in an equal or greater proportion are not their interests inseparably connected with those of their constituents by the rotation of appointment must they not mingle frequently with the mass of citizens is it not rather to be apprehended if they were possessed of the powers before described that the individual members would be induced to use them on many occasions very timidly and inefficaciously for fear of losing their popularity and future election we must take human nature as we find it perfection falls not to the share of mortals many are of opinion that congress have too frequently made use of the suppliant humble tone of requisition in applications to the states when they had a right to assert their imperial dignity and command obedience be that as it may requisitions are a perfect nullity where thirteen sovereign independent disunited states are in the habit of discussing and refusing compliance with them at their option requisitions are actually little better than a jest and a byword throughout the land if you tell the legislatures they have violated the treaty of peace and invaded the prerogatives of    the confederacy they will laugh in your face what then is to be done things cannot go on in the same train forever it is much to be feared as you observe that the better kind of people being digusted with the circumstances will have their minds prepared for any revolution whatever we are apt to run from one extreme into another to anticipate and prevent disastrous contingencies would be the part of wisdom and patriotism what astonishing changes a few years are capable of producing i am told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical form of government without horror from thinking proceeds speaking thence to acting is often but a single step but how irrevocable and tremendous what a triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions what a triumph for the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing ourselves and that systems founded on the basis of equal liberty are merely ideal and fallacious would to god that wise measures may be taken in time to avert the consequences we have but too much reason to apprehend retired as i am from the world i frankly acknowledge i cannot feel myself an unconcerned spectator yet having happily assisted in bringing the ship into port and having been fairly discharged it is not my business to embark again on a sea of troubles nor could it be expected that my sentiments and opinions would have much weight on the minds of my countrymen they have been neglected though given as a last legacy in the most solemn manner i had then    perhaps some claims to public attention i consider myself as having none at present mrs washington joins me in compliments etc with sentiments of sincere esteem and friendship i am dear sir c george washington    august      mount vernon marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette mount vernon    august      my dear marquis i will not conceal that my numerous correspondencies are daily becoming irksome to me yet i always receive your letters with augmenting satisfaction and therefore rejoice with you in the measures which are likely to be productive of a more frequent intercourse between our two nations thus motives of a private as well as of a public nature conspire to give me pleasure in finding that the active policy of france is preparing to take advantage of the supine stupidity of england with respect to our commerce while the latter by its impolitic duties and restrictions is driving our ships incessantly from its harbors the former seems by the invitations it is giving to stretch forth the friendly hand to invite them into its ports i am happy in a conviction that there may be established between france and the united states such a mutual intercourse of good offices and reciprocal interests as cannot fail to be attended with the happiest consequences nations are not influenced as individuals may be by disinterested friendships but when it is their interest to live in amity we have little reason to apprehend any rupture this principle    of union can hardly exist in a more distinguished manner between two nations than it does between france and the united states there are many articles of manufacture which we stand absolutely in need of and shall continue to have occasion for so long as we remain an agricultural people which will be while lands are so cheap and plenty that is to say for ages to come in the mean time we shall have large quantities of timber fish oil wheat tobacco rice indigo c to dispose of money we have not now it is obvious that we must have recourse for the goods and manufactures we may want to the nation which will enable us to pay for them by receiving our produce in return our commerce with any of the great manufacturing kingdoms of europe will therefore be in proportion to the facility of making remittances which such manufacturing nations may think proper to afford us on the other hand france has occasion for many of our productions and raw materials let her judge whether it is most expedient to receive them by direct importation and to pay for them in goods or to obtain them through the circuitous channel of britain and to pay for them in money as she formerly did i know that britain arrogantly expects we will sell our produce wherever we can find a market and bring the money to purchase goods from her i know that she vainly hopes to retain what share she pleases in our trade in consequence of our prejudices in favor of her fashions and manufacturers but these are illusions    which will vanish and disappoint her as the dreams of conquest have already done experience is constantly teaching us that these predilections were founded in error we find the quality and price of the french goods we receive in many instances to be better than the quality and price of the english time and a more thorough acquaintance with the business may be necessary to instruct your merchants in the choice and assortment of goods necessary for such a country as to an ability for giving credit in which the english merchants boast a superiority i am confident it would be happy for america if the practice could be entirely abolished however unimportant america may be considered at present and however britain may affect to despise her trade there will assuredly come a day when this country will have some weight in the scale of empires while connected with us as colonies only was not britain the first power in the world since the dissolution of that connexion does not france occupy the same illustrious place your successful endeavors my dear marquis to promote the interests of your two countries as you justly call them must give you the most unadulterated satisfaction be assured the measures which have lately been taken with regard to the two articles of oil and tobacco have tended very much to endear you to your fellow citizens on this side of the atlantic although i pretend to no peculiar information respecting commercial affairs nor any foresight into the scenes of futurity yet as the member of an infant    empire as a philanthropist by character and if i may be allowed the expression as a citizen of the great republic of humanity at large i cannot help turning my attention sometimes to this subject i would be understood to mean i cannot avoid reflecting with pleasure on the probable influence that commerce may hereafter have on human manners and society in general on these occasions i consider how mankind may be connected like one great family in fraternal ties i indulge a fond perhaps an enthusiastic idea that as the world is evidently much less barbarous than it has been its melioration must still be progressive that nations are becoming more humanized in their policy that the subjects of ambition and causes for hostility are daily diminishing and in fine that the period is not very remote when the benefits of a liberal and free commerce will pretty generally succeed to the devastations and horrors of war some of the late treaties which have been entered into and particularly that between the king of prussia and the united states seem to constitute a new era in negotiation and to promise the happy consequences i have just now been mentioning but let me ask you my dear marquis in such an enlightened such a liberal age how is it possible the great maritime powers of europe should submit to pay an annual tribute to the little piratical states of barbary would to heaven we had a navy able to reform those enemies to mankind or crush them into nonexistence     0 george washington   september      mount vernon david humphreys to david humphreys  mount vernon   september      my dear humphreys enclosed are all the documents mr lear could find respecting the confinement and treatment under it of captain asgill for want of recurrence to them before i wrote to mr tilghman  i perceive that a bad memory had run me into an error in my narrative of the latter in one particular for it should seem by that as if the loose and unguarded manner in which captain asgill was held was sanctioned by me whereas one of my letters to colonel dayton condemns this conduct and orders asgill to be closely confined mr lear has given all the letters at length extracts might have answered but i judged it better that the whole tenor of the correspondence should appear that no part might seem to be hidden i well remember major gordons attending asgill and by one of my letters to dayton it is evident that gordon had written to me but my letter books have registered no reply in what manner it would be best to bring this matter before the public i am at a loss and leave it to you to determine under a consideration of the circumstances which are as fully communicated as the documents in my hands will enable me to do there is one mystery in the business which i cannot develop nor are there any papers in my possession which explain it hazen was ordered to send an unconditional    prisoner asgill comes hazen or some other must have given information of a lieutenant turner under the former description turner is ordered on but never came why i am unable to say nor is there any letter from hazen to be found which accounts for a noncompliance with the order if i had not too many causes to distrust my memory i should ascribe it to there having been no such officer or that he was also under capitulation for captain shaach  seems to have been held as a proper victim after this i will write as soon as i am able to mr tilghman requesting him to withhold my first accounts of asgills treatment from his correspondent in england promising an authentic one from original papers it may however have passed him in that case it will be necessary for me to say something to reconcile my own accounts i write to you with a very aching head and disordered frame and mr lear will copy the letter saturday last by an imprudent act i brought on an ague and fever on sunday which returned with violence tuesday and thursday and if dr craiks efforts are ineffectual i shall have them again this day the family join me in every good wish for you it is unnecessary to assure you of the friendship and affection with which i am c p s we have found gordons letters they contain a demand of asgill as an officer protected by the capitulation of yorktown this i suppose is the reason they were not answered    george washington   september      mount vernon john francis mercer to john francis mercer mount vernon   september      dr sir your favor of the  0th ulto did not get to my hands till about the first of this month it found me in a fever from which i am now but sufficiently recovered to attend to business i mention this as the reason why your propositions have not been attended to before with respect to the first i never mean unless some particular circumstance should compel me to it to possess another slave by purchase it being among my first wishes to see some plan adopted by which slavery in this country may be abolished by slow sure and imperceptible degrees —with respect to the second i never did nor never intend to purchase a military certificate i see no difference it makes    with you if it is one of the funds allotted for the discharge of my claim who the purchaser is if the depreciation between them and specie is three for one you will have it in your power whilst at the receipt of custom—richmond—where it is said the great regulator of this business graves resides—to convert them into specie at that rate if the difference is more there would be no propriety if i inclined to deal in them at all in my taking them at that exchange i shall rely upon your promise of £ 00—in five weeks from the date of your letter it will enable me to pay the workmen which have been employed about this house all the spring  summer some of whom are yet here but there are two debts which press hard upon me—one of which if there is no other method left—i must sell land or negroes to discharge it is owing to the govr of new york clinton who was so obliging as to borrow the sum of £ 000 to answer some calls of mine—to be paid in    months after the conclusion of peace for this sum he became my security  for what remains due about £ 00 york currency i am now paying an interest of   pr ct—but the high interest tho more than any estate can bear i should not regard if my credit was not at stake to comply with the conditions of the loan the other debt tho i am anxious to discharge it and the person to whom i owe it i know wants it yet it might i believe be put off a while longer—this sum is larger than the other i am c    george washington    september      mount vernon william triplet to william triplet mount vernon    september      sir if mr lund washington has not misconceived the conversation which passed between you and me the day you lay ill in bed or if you understood the matter in the same light he seems to have done i find there is another mistake between us respecting mrs frenchs land which it behooves me to clear up as soon as possible he thinks you asked me if i meant to take the land for the term of robinsons lease and that i answered yes—if such a question and such an answer passed we must some how or other have been at cross purposes for clear and evident it must be even to yourself that i could have no intention of being concerned with the land at all unless it was for mrs frenchs life you may well recollect sir that i declared this in explicit terms in the conversation i had with you at my own house and assigned reasons for it to you—namely—that if i got this and mr manleys land it was my intention to blend them and my other plantations together and to form entire new ones out of the whole that i meant to go into an entire new course of cropping c would lay off my fields accordingly in a permanent and lasting farm by ditches and hedges—and that it was for this reason i was desirous of knowing this fall before i went into such arrangement and expence whether i had any chance of getting these places or not because it might be too late afterwards to make any change in my plan with this object in view i must have    been insane to have taken the plantation for the remainder of robinsons lease only first because it is uncertain whether i could get possession of the land or not never having exchanged a word with robinson on the subject nor never intending to do it unless i had got the place to myself entirely and secondly if i did because i should not probably be able to compleat the plan of enclosures by the time the lease would expire what situation should i be in then a new bargain under every disadvantage to make or go back to my former grounds in the latter case all my labor and expence would have been thrown away and my whole plan defeated—in the former that is supposing robinson could not be got off by fair means and mr lee is of opinion which opinion i had in my pocket at the time i calld upon you in expectation of meeting mrs french that without a regular demand of rent and reentry which might be a tedious and expensive process in courts the lease cannot be got aside under these circumstances i say i should have made myself liable for the payment of robinsons rent without deriving a single advantage will any body think this reasonable or suppose that whilst i retain my senses i would do it as i do not recollect that in the course of my life i ever forfeited my word or broke a promise made to any one i have been thus particular to evince if you understand the matter in the same light that lund washington did that i was not attending to or did not understand the question    i am sorry any mistake has happened and to convince you and mrs french that through the whole of this business i meant to act upon fair open and honorable grounds i will as mistakes have taken place and as there is a difference of opinion respecting the annual value of the lands and negroes leave it to any person of her own choosing major little if she pleases to say whether the rent after the expiration of robinsons lease shall be £    or £  0 pr an—if he thinks one too much and the other too little any sum between—mrs french has declared that she neither wanted nor would take more than the intrinsic worth of the place—i on the word of a man of honor declare that i do not desire it for a farthing less than the value for to make money by it was never my object but we differ in our sentiments of this is there any mode then so fair as for an impartial person to see the place and to hear what mrs french or you in her behalf and myself will say on the subject and then to decide according to this judgment from the facts and can there be any thing more favorable to her wishes than to have this determined by her friend in whom she places i presume implicit confidence i never exchanged a word directly nor indirectly with majr little on the subject but believing him to be a gentleman who will decide according to the dictates of his judgment i am not afraid to entrust the matter to him notwithstanding the family connexion between him and mrs french—in a word i am so conscious of the rectitude of my intentions in the whole of this business that it is a matter of the most perfect indifference    to me to whom it is left—and tho it may be supposed i have some sinister views in saying it yet without the gift of prophecy i will venture to pronounce that if mrs french misses me as a tenant she will repent long before robinsons lease expires for having done so—for i can assure her from an experience of more than twenty five years that there is a very wide difference between getting tenants and getting rents she may get a dozen of the first  i have not the smallest doubt but she may but if there is one among them who having no other dependence than the produce of the plantation will pay her the latter without hard working and pinching her negroes and a great deal of trouble and vexation to her i shall be more mistaken than i ever was in any thing of the kind in my life this may not appear so to her at first view because it is but too common to compare things without attending enough to the circumstances of them i have no doubt but that mrs french thinks it very strange that i should receive £  0 a year rent from mr dulaney and scruple to give her £  0—for rather more land and twenty odd negroes but has she considered that the one is accompanied by no charge except the land tax and the other with many and heavy ones and do not every body who have meadows and have ever made an estimate of their value know that an acre of tolerable good grass will pay all the expences of cutting curing and stacking and will put at least  0 in the owners    pocket annually what then has mr dulaney to do more than to keep up his fences to pay the rent by his advertisement of pasturage for horses at   pr week he has — acres suppose it — only the meadow alone without a single hand will yield him at least — pr ann is there a single acre of land on mrs frenchs plantation from which besides cropping so precarious this is to be expected is there a single acre which can be converted into meadow is not the land much worn greatly exhausted and gullied in many places none can deny it but why need i enumerate or dwell on these things have i not put the matter upon as fair a footing as a man possibly can do if mrs french wants no more than the value as she has declared what objection can she have to majr littles saying what that value is if this proposition is acceded to the sooner it is communicated to me the better i have never yet opened my mouth to robinson on the subject of his lease nor never intended to do it unless i had got the plantation for mrs frenchs life when i sent the papers to mr lee to draw the writings i asked his opinion of the lease which he gave to the effect already mentioned it was for my private satisfaction i asked it for as i told you before and now repeat i never had an intention to get him off otherwise than by fair means this year or any other this year will convince him or i am mistaken that his inevitable ruin if he has any thing to lose will follow his holding it another year if it is not the case already i am c    george washington  0 september      mount vernon bushrod washington to bushrod washington mount vernon  0 september      dear bushrod i was from home when your servant arrived found him in a hurry to be gone when i returned have company in the house and am on the eve of a journey up the river to meet the directors of the potomac company these things combining will not allow me time to give any explicit answer to the question you have propounded generally speaking i have seen as much evil as good result from such societies as you describe the constitution of yours to be they are a kind of imperium in imperio and as often clog as facilitate public measures i am no friend to institutions except in local matters which are wholly or in a great measure confined to the county of the delegates to me it appears much wiser and more politic to choose able and honest representatives and leave them in all national questions to determine from the evidence of reason and the facts which shall be adduced when internal and external information is given to them in a collective state what certainty is there that societies in a corner or remote part of a state can possess that knowledge which is necessary for them to decide on many important questions which may come before an assembly what reason is there to expect that the society itself may be accordant in opinion on such subjects may not a few members of this society more sagacious and designing than the rest direct the measures of it to private views of their own  0 may not this embarrass an honest able delegate who hears the voice of his country from all quarters and thwart public measures these are first thoughts but i give no decided opinion societies nearly similar to such as you speak of have lately been formed in massachusetts but what has been the consequence why they have declared the senate useless many other parts of the constitution unnecessary salaries of public officers burthensome c to point out the defects of the constitution if any existed in a decent way was proper enough but they have done more they first voted the courts of justice in the present circumstances of the state oppressive and next by violence stop them which has occasioned a very solemn proclamation and appeal from the governor to the people you may say no such matters are in contemplation by your society granted a snowball gathers by rolling possibly a line may be drawn between occasional meetings for special purposes and a standing society to direct with local views and partial information the affairs of the nation which cannot be well understood but by a large and comparative view of circumstances where is this so likely to enter as in the general assembly of the people what figure then must a delegate make who comes there with his hands tied and his judgment forestalled his very instructors perhaps if they had nothing sinister in view were they present at all the information and arguments which would come forward might be the first to change sentiments    hurried as this letter is i am sensible i am writing to you upon a very important subject i have no time to copy correct or even peruse it for which reason i could wish to have it or a copy returned to me george and his wife set off yesterday for the races at fredericksburg the rest of the family are well and join in love and good wishes for all at bushefield i am c     george washington    october      mount vernon george augustine washington to george augustine washington mount vernon    october      dr george it is natural for young married people who are launching into life to look forward to a permanent    establishment if they are prudent they will be reasonably solicitous to provide for those who come after and have a right to look to them for support it is also natural for those who have passed the meridian of life and are descending into the shades of darkness to make arrangements for the disposal of the property of which they are possessed the first of these observations will apply to you and the second to myself i have no doubt but that you and fanny are as happy and contented in this family as circumstances will admit yet something is still wanting to make that situation more stable and pleasing it is well known that the expensive manner in which i am as it were involuntarily compelled to live will admit of no diminution in my income nor could it be expected if i now had or ever should have descendants that i either would or ought in justice to deprive them of what the laws of nature and the laws the land if left to themselves have declared to be their inheritance the first however is not the case at present and the second not likely to be so hereafter under this statement then i may add that it is my present intention to give you at my death my landed property in the neck containing by estimation between two  three thousand acres by purchases from wm clifton and george brent and that the reasons why i communicate this matter to you at this time are that you may if you chuse it seat the negroes which colo bassett has promised you upon that part of the cleared land on which saml johnson formerly    lived and under this expectation and prospect that you may when it perfectly suits your inclination and convenience be preparing for and building thereon by degrees you may say or think perhaps that as there is a contingency tacked to this intimation the offer is too precarious to hazard the expence of building but if mrs washington should survive me there is a moral certainty of my dying without issue and should i be the longest liver the matter in my opinion is hardly less certain for while i retain the faculty of reasoning i shall never marry a girl and it is not probable that i should have children by a woman of an age suitable to my own should i be disposed to enter into a second marriage however that there may be no possibility of your sustaining a loss the matter may rest on the footing of compensation i do therefore hereby declare it to be and it is my express meaning that if by the event above alluded to or any other by which you may be deprived of the feesimple in the lands herein mentioned unless a full equivalent is given in lieu thereof that i will pay the cost of any buildings which you may erect on the premises the use of the plantation it is presumed will be adequate for the fences with which it may be enclosed and for the labor arising from the cultivation—nothing therefore need be said on that head here then the prospect of a permanent inheritance is placed in the opposite scale of possible disappointment and you are to judge for yourself    i have been thus particular because i would be clearly understood because it is not my wish to deceive and because i would not even raise an expectation not warranted from the premises by fair deduction johnsons plantation as i believe you know is destitute of fencing but there is timber at hand the cleared land whatever may have been the original quality of it now is by use and more so by abuse much gullied and in bad condition but as there is a sufficiency of it for the hands you will get it may soon by care good management and a proper course of cropping be recovered one thing more and i will close this letter do not infer from my proposing it to you to build that i meant it as a hint for you to prepare another home i had no such idea to point you to a settlement which you might make at leisure  with convenience was all i had in view more than once i have informed you that in proportion as age and its concomitants encrease upon me i shall stand in need of some person in whose industry and integrity i can confide for assistance the double ties by which you are connected with this family to say nothing of the favorable opinion we have of you by marriage union have placed you differently from any other of my relations for this purpose because no other married couple could give or probably would receive the same satisfaction by living in it as you and fanny do but whether you remain in the same house or at a future day may remove to the place proposed your services    will be convenient and essential to me because with your aid i shall be able to manage my concerns without having recourse to a steward which comports neither with my interest nor inclination to employ with very affectionate regard i am c george washington    october      mount vernon henry lee to henry lee in congress mount vernon    october      my dear sir i am indebted to you for your several favors of the  st   th and   th of this instant and shall reply to them in the order of their dates but first let me thank you for the interesting communications imparted by them the picture which you have exhibited and the accounts which are published of the commotions and temper of numerous bodies in the eastern states are equally to be lamented and deprecated they exhibit a melancholy proof of what our transatlantic foe has predicted and of another thing perhaps which is still more to be regretted and is yet more unaccountable that mankind when left to themselves are unfit for their own government i am mortified beyond expression when i view the clouds that have spread over the brightest morn that ever dawned upon any country in a word i am lost in amazement when i behold what intrigue the interested views of desperate characters ignorance and jealousy of the minor part are capable of effecting as a    scourge on the major part of our fellow citizens of the union for it is hardly to be supposed that the great body of the people though they will not act can be so shortsighted or enveloped in darkness as not to see rays of a distant sun through all this mist of intoxication and folly  you talk my good sir of employing influence to appease the present tumults in massachusetts i know not where that influence is to be found or if attainable that it would be a proper remedy for the disorders influence is no government let us have one by which our lives liberties and properties will be secured or let us know the worst at once under these impressions my humble opinion is that there is a call for decision know precisely what the insurgents aim at if they have real grievances redress them if possible or acknowledge the justice of them and your inability to do it in the present moment if they have not employ the force of government against them at once if this is inadequate all will be convinced that the superstructure is bad or wants support to be more exposed in the eyes of the world and more contemptible than we already are is hardly possible to delay one or the other of these is to exasperate on the one hand or to give confidence on    the other and will add to their numbers for like snowballs such bodies increase by every movement unless there is something in the way to obstruct and crumble them before the weight is too great and irresistible these are my sentiments precedents are dangerous things let the reins of government then be braced and held with a steady hand and every violation of the constitution be reprehended if defective let it be amended but not suffered to be trampled upon whilst it has an existence with respect to the navigation of the mississippi you already know my sentiments thereon they have been uniformly the same and as i have observed to you in a former letter are controverted by one consideration only of weight and that is the operation which the conclusion of it may have on the minds of the western settlers who will not consider the subject in a relative point of view or on a comprehensive scale and may be influenced by the demagogues of the country to acts of extravagance and desperation under a popular declamation that their interests are sacrificed colonel mason at present is in a fit of the gout what his sentiments on the subject are i know not nor whether he will be able to attend the assembly during the present session for some reasons however which need not be mentioned i am inclined to believe he will advocate the navigation of that river but in all matters of great national moment the only true line of conduct in my opinion is dispassionately to compare the advantages and disadvantages    of the measure proposed and decide from the balance the lesser evil where there is a choice of them should always yield to the greater what benefits more than we now enjoy are to be obtained by such a treaty as you have delineated with spain i am not enough of a commercial man to give any opinion on  the china came to hand without much damage  i thank you for your attention in the procuring  forwarding it  mrs washington joins me in best wishes for mrs lee and yourself i am dear sir c   0 george washington   november      mount vernon james madison to james madison mount vernon   november      my dear sir i thank you for the communications in your letter of the  st instant the decision of the house on the question respecting a paper emission is portentous i hope of an auspicious session it certainly may be classed with the important questions of the present day and merited the serious attention of the assembly fain would i hope that the great and most important of all subjects the federal government may be considered with that calm and deliberate attention which the magnitude of it so critically and loudly calls for at this critical moment let prejudices unreasonable    jealousies and local interests yield to reason and liberality let us look to our national character and to things beyond the present moment no morn ever dawned more favorably than ours did and no day was ever more clouded than the present wisdom and good examples are necessary at this time to rescue the political machine from the impending storm virginia has now an opportunity to set the latter and has enough of the former i hope to take the lead in promoting this great and arduous work without an alteration in our political creed the superstructure we have been seven years in raising at the expense of so much treasure and blood must fall we are fast verging to anarchy and confusion by a letter which i have received from general knox who had just returned from massachusetts whither he had been sent by congress consequent of the commotions in that state is replete with melancholy accounts of the temper and designs of a considerable part of that people among other things he says their creed is that the property of the united states has been protected from the confiscation of britain by the joint exertions of all and therefore ought to be the common property of all and he that attempts opposition to this creed is an enemy to equity and justice and ought to be swept from off the face of the earth again they are determined to annihilate all debts public and private and have agrarian laws which are easily effected by the means of unfunded paper money which shall be a tender in all cases whatever he adds the number of these people amount in massachusetts to about one fifth part of several populous counties and to them may be collected people of similar sentiments from the states of rhode island    connecticut and new hampshire so as to constitute a body of about twelve or fifteen thousand desperate and unprincipled men they are chiefly of the young and active part of the community how melancholy is the reflection that in so short a space we should have made such large strides towards fulfilling the predictions of our transatlantic foes leave them to themselves and their government will soon dissolve will not the wise and good strive hard to avert this evil or will their supineness suffer ignorance and the arts of selfinterested designing disaffected and desperate characters to involve this great country in wretchedness and contempt what stronger evidence can be given of the want of energy in our government than these disorders if there is not power in it to check them what security has a man for life liberty or property to you i am sure i need not add aught on this subject the consequences of a lax or inefficient government are too obvious to be dwelt upon thirteen sovereignties pulling against each other and all tugging at the federal head will soon bring ruin on the whole whereas a liberal and energetic constitution well guarded and closely watched to prevent encroachments might restore us to that degree of respectability and consequences to which we had a fair claim and the brightest prospect of attaining with sentiments of very great esteem and regard i am dear sir c     george washington    november      mount vernon bushrod washington to bushrod washington mount vernon    november      dear bushrod your letter of the   st of october in reply to mine of the  0th of september came safe to hand it was not the intention of my former letter either to condemn or give my voice in favor of the patriotic society of which you have now but not before declared yourself a member nor do i mean to do it now i offered observations under the information i had then received the weight of which was to be considered as first thoughts they were undigested and might be very erroneous that representatives ought to be the mouth of    their constituents i do not deny nor do i mean to call in question the right of the latter to instruct them it is to the embarrassment into which they may be thrown by these instructions in national matters that my objections lie in speaking of national matters i look to the federal government which in my opinion it is the interest of every state to support and to do this as there are a variety of interests in the union there must be a yielding of the parts to coalesce the whole now a county a district or even a state might decide on a measure which though apparently for the benefit of it in its unconnected state may be repugnant to the interests of the nation and eventually to the state itself as a part of the confederation if then members go instructed to the assembly from certain districts the requisitions of congress repugnant to the sense of them and all the lights which they may receive from the communications of that body to the legislature must be unavailing although the nature and necessity of them when the reasons therefor are fully expounded which can only be given by congress to the assembly through the executive and which come before them in their legislative capacity are as clear as the sun in local matters which concern the district or things which respect the internal policy of the state there may be nothing amiss in instructions in national matters also the sense but not the law of the district may be given leaving the delegates to judge from the nature of the case and the evidence before them    the instructions of your society as far as they have gone meet my entire approbation except in the article of commutables here if i understand the meaning and design of the clause i must disagree to it most heartily for if the intention of it is to leave it optional with the person taxed to pay any staple commodity tobacco would be least exceptionable in lieu of specie the people will be burthened a few speculators enriched and the public derive no benefit from it have we not had a recent and melancholy proof of this during the war in the provision tax did not the people pay this in some way or other perhaps badly and was not the army almost starved can any instance be given where the public has sold tobacco hemp flour or any other commodity upon as good terms as individuals have done it must not there be places of deposit for these commutables collectors storekeepers and the like employed these rely on it will sink one half and a parcel of speculators will possess themselves of the other half it was to these things that we owe the present depravity of the minds of so many people of this country and filled it with so many knaves and designing characters among the great objects which you took into consideration at your meeting at richmond how comes it to pass that you never turned your eyes to the inefficacy of the federal government so as to instruct your delegates to accede to the propositions of the commissioners at annapolis or to devise some other mode to give it that energy which is necessary to    support a national character every man who considers the present constitution of it and sees to what it is verging trembles the fabric which took nine years at the expense of much blood and treasure to rear now totters to the foundation and without support must soon fall the determination of your society to promote frugality and industry by example to encourage manufactures and to avoid dissipation is highly praiseworthy these and premiums for the most useful discoveries in agriculture within your district the most profitable course of cropping and the best method of fencing to save timber would soon make us a rich and happy people with every good wish for you and yours in which your aunt joins i am c george washington    november      mount vernon james madison to james madison mount vernon    november      my dear sir not having sent to the postoffice with my usual regularity your favor of the  th did not reach me in time for an earlier acknowledgment than of this date it gives me the most sensible pleasure to hear that the acts of the present session are marked with wisdom justice and liberality they are the palladium of good policy and the sure paths that lead to national happiness would to god every state would let these be the leading features of their constituent characters those threatening clouds which seem    ready to burst on the confederacy would soon dispel the unanimity with which the bill was received for appointing commissioners agreeably to the recommendation of the convention at annapolis and the uninterrupted progress it has met with since are indications of a favorable issue it is a measure of equal necessity and magnitude and may be the spring of reanimation although i had bid adieu to the public walks of life in a public manner and had resolved never more to tread on public ground yet if upon an occasion so interesting to the wellbeing of the confederacy it should have appeared to have been the wish of the assembly to have employed me with other associates in the business of revising the federal system i should from a sense of the obligation i am under for repeated proofs of confidence in me more than from any opinion i should have entertained of my usefulness have obeyed its call but it is now out of my power to do this with any degree of consistency the cause i will mention i presume you heard sir that i was first appointed and have since been rechosen president of the society of the cincinnati and you may have understood also that the triennial general meeting of this body is to be held in philadelphia the first monday in may next some particular reasons combining with the peculiar situation of my private concerns the necessity of paying attention to them a wish for retirement and relaxation from public cares and rheumatic pains which i begin to feel very sensibly induced me    on the   st ultimo to address a circular letter to each state society informing them of my intention not to be at the next meeting and of my desire not to be rechosen president the vicepresident  is also informed of this that the business of the society may not be impeded by my absence under these circumstances it will readily be perceived that i could not appear at the same time and place on any other occasion without giving offence to a very worthy and respectable part of the community the late officers of the american army i feel as you do for our acquaintance colo lee better never have delegated than left him out unless some daring impropriety of conduct had been ascribed to him  i hear with pleasure that you are in the new choice with sentiments of the highest esteem and affection i am c george washington   december      mount vernon fielding lewis to fielding lewis mount vernon   december      sir your letter of the   th of octor never came to my hands till yesterday—altho your disrespectful conduct towards me in coming into this country and spending weeks therein without ever coming near me entitles you to very little notice or favor from me    yet i consent that you may get timber from off my land in fauquier county to build a house on your lott in rectertown having granted this now let me ask you what your views were in purchasing a lott in a place which i presume originated with and will end in two or three gin shops which probably will exist no longer than they serve to ruin the proprietors and those who make the most frequent applications to them i am c george washington    december      mount vernon p marsteller to p marsteller mount vernon    december      sir to the severity of the weather whch has in a manner shut every thing up and put a stop to all intercourse and to some other circumstances unnecessary to mention is to be ascribed my silence till now and even now when i recollect how fully i have already explained my ideas to you on what is intended to be the subject of this letter i find that i have hardly anything to trouble you with by way of illucidation i will just observe however that having been well informed that seasons and circumstances have occurred and probably will arrive again when goods by vendue have sold considerably below the sterlg cost of them—nay that they have even been bought for the nominal sum currency which they cost sterling in the countries from whence they were imported and having found from experience that i derive little or  0 no advantage from the ready money payments i make for such articles as are requisite for the use of my estate when i go to the stores in alexandria i had determined to make the proposition to you which was pretty fully explained in the conversation i had with you at our last inteview as has been already mentioned and which in a word is as follows— to allow you a commission of  ½ p ct which you yourself declared was sufficient upon all purchases you shall make for me at vendue of articles which may from time to time be enumerated to you it is your interest i know to sell high—it is mine to buy low—but there is nothing incompatible that i can conceive in your agency in both these cases for when the former is the case i mean not to become a purchaser—when the latter happens which no skill or exertion of yours can at all times prevent is the moment of which i mean thro your attention to the business to avail myself for supplies to your knowledge of the goods which are intended for sale the circumstances of the sale and to your honor of which i entertain a very favorable opinion from the good report made of it by others i entirely confide for the management the payments shall always keep pace with the purchases you have nothing more to do therefore than to give intimation of the latter by a line lodged at the post office to receive the former and were you now and then to add a concise list of the principal articles which are for sale it would be obliging to particularize all the articles which are necessary    for the use of a large family would be as tedious as unnecessary every merchant who retails and every man who provides for one can be at no loss for them the heavy articles and such as at present occur to me are enumerated in the enclosed list—in which you will perceive no mention is made of coarse woolens because of these i manufacture a sufficiency to clothe my outdoor negroes—nor have i said any thing of wines because i import my own—but of the latter if good claret should at any time go cheap i would take two or three boxes—i have been obliged to buy about  00 ells of ticklenburg for present use—perhaps the   or  00 more enumerated in the enclosed may suffice—possibly more may be wanted—the blankets will not be wanted before next autumn of sugars my demand as a private family is great and constant—but of coffee and molasses i have on hand a large stock it is scarcely necessary to impress on you the idea that it is the prospect of very cheap buying which has induced me to adopt this mode of obtaining my supplies and that unless the end is accomplished my purposes will not be answered nor my inclination gratified by it but to prevent mistakes i explicitly declare it few of the enumerated articles am i in present want of—those for which i shall soonest have a call are marked thus  in the margin many of the others i may dispense with a year or two years—they stand in the list as a memento only in case very favorable moments present for the purchase of them    i am told it sometimes happens that goods which come under the imputation of being damaged tho in fact they have received little or no real injury are frequently sold uncommonly low indeed—particularly bale blanketing and other bale goods—to embrace such opportunities is recommended not in this judgment and a close inspection are necessary for it is not the lowest priced goods that are always the cheapest—the quality is or ought to be as much an object with the purchaser as the price i pray you to accept my thanks for the trouble you had with the german redemptioners which were purchased for me—the expence my nephew the bearer of this will pay i am c george washington    december      mount vernon james madison to james madison mount vernon    december      dear sir your favor of the  th came to my hands the evening before last the resolutions which you say are inserted in the papers i have not yet seen  the latter come irregularly though i am a subscriber to hays gazette besides the reasons which were assigned in my circular letter to the several state societies of the cincinnati for my nonattendance at the next general    meeting to be holden at philadelphia on the first monday in may next there existed one of a political nature which operated stronger on my mind than all the others and which in confidence i will now communicate to you when this society was first formed i am persuaded not a member of it conceived that it would give birth to those jealousies or be charged with those dangers real or imaginary with which the minds of many and of some respectable characters in these states seem to be agitated the motives which induced the officers to enter into it were i am positive truly and frankly recited in the institution one of which and the principal was to establish a charitable fund for the relief of such of their compatriots the widows and descendants of them as were fit objects for such support and for whom no public provision had been made by the public but the trumpet being sounded the alarm was spreading far and wide i readily perceived therefore that unless a modification of the plan could be effected to annihilate the society altogether was impracticable on account of the foreign officers who had been admitted irritations would arise which would soon draw a line between the society and their fellow citizens to avoid this to conciliate the affections and to convince the world of the purity of the plan i exerted myself and with much difficulty effected the changes which appeared in the recommendation that proceeded from the general meeting to those of individual states but the accomplishment of it was not easy and i    have since heard that while some states have acceded to the recommendation others are not disposed to do so alleging that unreasonable prejudices and illfounded jealousies ought not to influence a measure laudable in its institution and salutary in its objects and operation under these circumstances it may readily be conceived that the part i should have had to have acted would have been delicate on the one hand i might be charged with dereliction of the officers who had nobly supported me and had even treated me with uncommon attention and attachment on the other with supporting a measure incompatible with republican principles i thought it best therefore without assigning this the principal reason to decline the presidency and to excuse my attendance on the ground which is firm and just of necessity of attending to my private concerns and in conformity to my determination of spending the remainder of my days in a state of retirement and to indisposition occasioned by rheumatic complaints with which at times i am a good deal afflicted professing at the same time my entire approbation of the institution as altered and the pleasure i feel at the subsidence of those jealousies which have yielded to the change presuming on the general adoption of it i have been thus particular to show that under circumstances like these i should feel myself in an awkward situation to be in philadelphia on another public occasion during the sitting of this society that the present moment is pregnant of great and    strange events none who will cast their eyes around them can deny what may be brought forth between this and the first of may to remove the difficulties which at present labor in my mind against the acceptance of the honor which has lately been conferred on me by the assembly is not for me to predict but i should think it incompatible with that candor which ought to characterize an honest mind not to declare that under my present view of the matter i should be too much embarrassed by the meeting of these two bodies in the same place at the same moment after what i have written to be easy in my situation and therefore that it would be improper to let my appointment stand in the way of another of this you who have had the whole matter before you will judge for having received no other than private intimation of my election and unacquainted with the formalities which are or ought to be used on these occasions silence may be deceptious or considered as disrespectful the imputation of both or either i would wish to avoid this is the cause of the present disclosure to you immediately upon my receipt of your letter which has been locked up by ice for i have had no communication with alexandria for many days till the day before yesterday my sentiments are decidedly against commutables for sure i am it will be found a tax without a revenue that the people will be burthened the public expectation deceived and a few speculators only enriched thus the matter will end after the morals of some are more corrupted than they    now are—and the minds of all filled with more leaven by finding themselves taxed and the public demands in full force tobacco on acct of the public places of deposit and from the accustomed mode of negotiating the article is certainly better fitted for a commutable than any other production of this country but if i understand the matter rightly i have it from report only will any man pay five pounds in specie for five taxables when the same sum supposing tobacco not to exceed  0s per cwt will purchase  00 lbs of tobo and this if at   s will discharge the tax on seven and will not the man who neither makes nor can easily procure this commodity complain of the inequality of such a mode especially when he finds that the revenue is diminished by the difference be it what it may between the real and nominal price and that he is again to be taxed to make this good these and such like things in my humble opinion are extremely hurtful and are among the principal causes that produce depravity and corruption without accomplishing the object in view for it is not the shadow but the substance with which taxes must be paid if we mean to be honest with sentiments c     george washington    december      mount vernon edmund randolph to edmund randolph governor of virginia  mount vernon    december      sir i had not the honor of receiving your excellencys favor of the  th with the enclosure till last night  sensible as i am of the honor conferred on me by the general assembly of this commonwealth in appointing me one of the deputies to a convention proposed to be held in the city of philadelphia in may next for the purpose of revising the federal constitution and desirous as i am on all occasions of testifying a ready obedience to the calls of my country yet sir there exist at this moment circumstances which i am persuaded will render this fresh instance of confidence incompatible with other measures which i had previously adopted and from which seeing little prospect of disengaging myself it would be disingenuous not to express a wish that some other character on whom greater reliance can be had may be substituted in my place the probability of my nonattendance being too great to continue my appointment    as no mind can be more deeply impressed than mine is with the critical situation of our affairs resulting in a great measure from the want of efficient powers in the federal head and due respect to its ordinances so consequently those who do engage in the important business of removing these defects will carry with them every good wish of mine which the best dispositions towards the obtainment can bestow i am c  george washington    december      mount vernon david humphreys to david humphreys mount vernon    december      mr dear humphreys i am much indebted to you for your several favors of the  st  th and   th of november the last came first mr morse having in mind the old proverb was determined not to make more haste than good speed in prosecuting his journey to georgia so i got the two first lately for your publication respecting the treatment of captain asgill i am exceedingly obliged to you the manner of making it is the best that could be    devised whilst the matter will prove the illiberality as well as the fallacy of the reports which have been circulated on that occasion and which are fathered upon that officer as the author it is with the deepest and most heartfelt concern i perceive by some late paragraphs extracted from the boston papers that the insurgents of massachusetts far from being satisfied with the redress offered by their general court are still acting in open violation of law and government and have obliged the chief magistrate in a decided tone to call upon the militia of the state to support the constitution what gracious god is man that there should be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct it is but the other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions under which we now live constitutions of our own choice and making and now we are unsheathing the sword to overturn them the thing is so unaccountable that i hardly know how to realize it or to persuade myself that i am not under the illusion of a dream my mind previous to the receipt of your letter of the  st ultimo had often been agitated by a thought similar to the one you have expressed respecting an old friend of yours but heaven forbid that a crisis should come when he shall be driven to the necessity of making choice of either of the alternatives there mentioned  let me entreat you my dear sir to  00 keep me advised of the situation of affairs in your quarter i can depend upon your accounts newspaper paragraphs unsupported by other testimony are often contradictory and bewildering at one time these insurgents are spoken of as a mere mob at other times as systematic in all their proceedings if the first i would fain hope that like other mobs it will however formidable be of short duration if the latter there are surely men of consequence and abilities behind the curtain who move the puppets the designs of whom may be deep and dangerous they may be instigated by british counsel actuated by ambitious motives or being influenced by dishonest principles had rather see the country in the horrors of civil discord than do what justice would dictate to an honest mind i had scarcely despatched my circular letters to the several state societies of the cincinnati when i received letters from some of the principal members of our assembly expressing a wish that they might be permitted to name me as one of the deputies of this state to the convention proposed to be held at philadelphia the first of may next i immediately wrote to my particular friend mr madison and gave similar reasons to the others the answer is contained in the extract no   in reply i got the extract no   this obliges me to be more explicit and confidential  0  with him on points which a recurrence to the conversations we have had on this subject will bring to your mind and save me the hazard of a recital in this letter since this interchange of letters i have received from the governor the letter no   and have written no   in answer to it should this matter be further pressed which i hope it will not as i have no inclination to go what had i best do you as an indifferent person and one who is much better acquainted with the sentiments and views of the cincinnati than i am for in this state where the recommendations of the general meeting have been agreed to hardly any thing is said about it as also with the temper of the people and state of politics at large can determine upon better ground and fuller evidence than myself especially as you have opportumities of knowing in what light the states to the eastward consider the convention and the measures they are pursuing to contravene or to give efficiency to it on the last occasion  only five states were represented none east of new york why the new england governments did not appear i am yet to learn for of all others the distractions and turbulent temper of these people would i should have thought have afforded the strongest evidence of the necessity of competent powers somewhere that the federal government is nearly if not quite at a stand none will deny the first question then is shall it be annihilated or supported if the latter the proposed convention is an object of the first magnitude  0  and should be sustained by all the friends of the present constitution in the other case if on a full and dispassionate revision the continuance shall be adjudged impracticable or unwise as only delaying an event which must ere long take place would it not be better for such a meeting to suggest some other to avoid if possible civil discord or other impending evils i must candidly confess as we could not remain quiet more than three or four years in time of peace under the constitutions of our own choosing which it was believed in many states at least were formed with deliberation and wisdom i see little prospect either of our agreeing upon any other or that we should remain long satisfied under it if we could yet i would wish any thing and every thing essayed to prevent the effusion of blood and to avert the humiliating and contemptible figure we are about to make in the annals of mankind if this second attempt to convene the states for the purposes proposed by the report of the partial representation at annapolis in september should also prove abortive it may be considered as an unequivocal evidence that the states are not likely to agree on any general measure which is to pervade the union and of course that there is an end of federal government the states therefore which make the last dying essay to avoid these misfortunes would be mortified at the issue and their deputies would return home chagrined at their ill success and disappointment this would be a disagreeable circumstance for any one of them to be in but more particularly so for a person in my situation if no  0  further application is made to me of course i shall not attend if there is i am under no obligation to do it but as i have had so many proofs of your friendship know your abilities to judge and your opportunities of learning the politics of the day on the points i have enumerated you would oblige me by a full and confidential communication of your sentiments thereon peace and tranquillity prevail in this state the assembly by a very great majority and in very emphatical terms have rejected an application for paper money and spurned the idea of fixing the value of military certificates by a scale of depreciation in some other respects too the proceedings of the present session have been marked with justice and a strong desire of supporting the federal system although i lament the effect i am pleased at the cause which has deprived us of the pleasure of your aid in the attack of christmas pies we had one yesterday on which all the company tho pretty numerous were hardly able to make an impression mrs washington  george  his wife mr lear i had occasion to send to the western country join in affectionate regards for you and with sentiments c i am c george washington    december      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon    december      my dear sir    i feel my dear general knox infinitely more than i can express to you for the disorders which have arisen in these states good god who besides  0  a tory could have foreseen or a briton predicted them were these people wiser than others or did they judge of us from the corruption and depravity of their own hearts the latter i am persuaded was the case and that notwithstanding the boasted virtue of america we are very little if anything behind them in dispositions to every thing that is bad i do assure you that even at this moment when i reflect upon the present prospect of our affairs it seems to me to be like the vision of a dream my mind can scarcely realize it as a thing in actual existence so strange so wonderful does it appear to me in this as in most other matters we are too slow when this spirit first dawned probably it might have been easily checked but it is scarcely within the reach of human ken at this moment to say when where or how it will terminate there are combustibles in every state which a spark might set fire to in this a perfect calm prevails at present and a prompt disposition to support and give energy to the federal system is discovered if the unlucky stirring of the dispute respecting the navigation of the mississippi does not become a leaven that will ferment and sour the mind of it the resolutions of the present session respecting a paper emission military certificates c have stamped justice and liberality on the proceedings of the assembly by a late act it seems very desirous of a general convention to revise and amend the federal constitution apropos what prevented the eastern states from attending the september meeting at annapolis  0  of all the states in the union it should have seemed to me that a measure of this sort distracted as they were with internal commotions and experiencing the want of energy in the government would have been most pleasing to them what are the prevailing sentiments of the one now proposed to be held in philadelphia in may next and how will it be attended you are at the fountain of intelligence where the wisdom of the nation it is to be presumed is concentred consequently better able as i have had sufficient experience of your intelligence confidence and candor to solve these questions the maryland assembly has been violently agitated by the question for a paper emission it has been carried in the house of delegates but what has been or may be the fate of the bill in the senate i have not yet heard the partisans in favor of the measure in the lower house threaten it is said a secession if it is rejected by that branch of the legislature thus are we advancing in regretting which i have often done with the keenest sorrow the death of our much lamented friend general greene i have accompanied it of late with a query whether he would not have preferred such an exit to the scenes which it is more than probable many of his compatriots may live to bemoan in both your letters you intimate that the men of reflection principle and property in new england feeling the inefficacy of their present government are contemplating a change but you are not explicit with respect to its nature it has been supposed  0  that the constitution of the state of massachusetts was amongst the most energetic in the union may not these disorders then be ascribed to an indulgent exercise of the powers of administration if your laws authorized and your powers are equal to the suppression of these tumults in the first instance delay and unnecessary expedients were improper these are rarely well applied and the same causes would produce similar effects in any form of government if the powers of it are not exercised i ask this question for information i know nothing of the facts that great britain will be an unconcerned spectator of the present insurrections if they continue is not to be expected that she is at this moment sowing the seeds of jealousy and discontent among the various tribes of indians on our frontiers admits of no doubt in my mind and that she will improve every opportunity to foment the spirit of turbulence within the bowels of the united states with a view of distracting our governments and promoting divisions is with me not less certain her first manœuvres in this will no doubt be covert and may remain so till the period shall arrive when a decided line of conduct may avail her charges of violating the treaty and other pretexts will then not be wanting to color overt acts tending to effect the great objects of which she has long been in labor a man is now at the head of their american affairs well calculated to conduct measures of this kind and more than probably was selected for the purpose we ought not therefore to sleep nor to slumber vigilance in watching and vigor  0  in acting is become in my opinion indispensably necessary if the powers are inadequate amend or alter them but do not let us sink into the lowest state of humiliation and contempt and become a byword in all the earth i think with you that the spring will unfold important and distressing scenes unless much wisdom and good management is displayed in the interim adieu be assured no man has a higher esteem and regard for you than i have none more sincerely your friend p s mrs washington joins me in every good wish for you and mrs knox and in compliments of congratulation on the late addition to your family      george washington  0 january      mount vernon bushrod washington to bushrod washington mount vernon  0 january      my dear bushrod i condole most sincerely with you my sister  family on the death of my brother  i feel most sensibly for this event but resignation being our duty—to attempt an expression of my sorrow on this occasion would be as feebly described as it would be unavailing when related if there are any occasional services which i can render my sister or any of you i shall have great pleasure in the execution if i could discharge the duties of an executor i would undertake the trust most cheerfully but in truth i am not in a situation to do this already i am so much involved in and  0  so perplexed with other peoples affairs that my own are very much unattended to happily there is not the least occasion of my assistance in the administration of your deceased fathers estate your competency alone is sufficient for this purpose—when joined by that of my sister and your brother the task will be easy it may be an alleviating circumstance of my brothers death that his affairs fall into such good hands and that each of you have dispositions and capability to do what is proper    george washington   february      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon   february      my dear sir i feel myself exceedingly obliged to you for the full and friendly communications in your letters of the   th   st and   th ultimo and shall critically as matters are described in the letter be exceedingly anxious to know the issue of the movements of the forces that were assembling in support of and in opposition to the constitution of massachusetts the moment is important if government shrinks or is unable to enforce its laws fresh manœuvres will be displayed by the insurgents anarchy and confusion must prevail and every thing will be turned topsyturvy in that state where it is not probable it will end   0  in your letter of the   th you express a wish to be informed of my intention respecting the convention proposed to be held in philadelphia may next in confidence i inform you that it is not at this time my intention to attend it when this matter was first moved in the assembly of this state some of the principal characters of it wrote to me requesting they might be permitted to put my name in the delegation to this i objected they again pressed and i again refused assigning among other reasons my having declined meeting the society of the cincinnati at that place about the same time and that i thought it would be disrespectful to that body to whom i owe much to be there on any other occasion notwithstanding these intimations my name was inserted in the act and an official communication thereof made by the executive to me to whom at the same time that i expressed my sense for the confidence reposed in me i declared that as i saw no prospect of my attending it was my wish that my name might not remain in the delegation to the exclusion of another to this i have been requested in emphatical terms not to decide absolutely as no inconvenience would result from the new appointment of another at least for some time yet   0 thus the matter stands which is the reason of my saying to you in confidence that at present i retain my first intention not to go in the mean while as i have the fullest conviction of your friendship for and attachment to me know your abilities to judge and your means of information i shall receive any communications from you on this subject with thankfulness my first wish is to do for the best and to act with propriety you know me too well to believe that reserve or concealment of any opinion or circumstance would be at all agreeable to me the legality of this convention i do not mean to discuss nor how problematical the issue of it may be that powers are wanting none can deny through what medium they are to be derived will like other matters engage the attention of the wise that which takes the shortest course to obtain them in my opinion will under present circumstances be found best otherwise like a house on fire whilst the most regular mode of extinguishing the flames is contended for the building is reduced to ashes my opinion of the energetic wants of the federal government are well known my public annunciations and private declarations have uniformly expressed these sentiments and however constitutional it may be for congress to point out the defects of the federal system i am strongly inclined to believe that it would not be found the most efficacious channel for the recommendations more especially the alterations to flow for reasons too obvious to enumerate      the system on which you seem disposed to build a national government is certainly more energetic and i dare say in every point of view more desirable than the present which from experience we find is not only slow debilitated and liable to be thwarted by every breath but is defective in that secrecy which for the accomplishment of many of the most important national objects is indispensably necessary and besides having the legislative executive and judiciary departments concentred is exceptionable but at the same time that i gave this opinion i believe the political machine will yet be much tumbled and tossed and possibly be wrecked altogether before that or any thing like it will be adopted the darling sovereignties of each state the governors elected and elect the legislators with a long tribe of et ceteras whose political importance will be lessened if not annihilated would give their weight of opposition to such a revolution but i may be speaking without book for scarcely ever going off my own farms i see few people who do not call upon me and am very little acquainted with the sentiments of the great public indeed after what i have seen or rather after what i have heard i shall be surprised at nothing for if three years since any person had told me that there would have been such a formidable rebellion as     exists at this day against the laws and constitution of our own making i should have thought him a bedlamite a fit subject for a madhouse adieu you know how much and how sincerely i am your ever affectionate and most obedient servant george washington    february      mount vernon charles washington to charles washington mount vernon    february      dear charles when the enclosed was written i knew nothing of georges  intention of visiting berkeley the safe conveyance afforded by him is very favorable and i gladly embraced it having seen bushrod and corbin washington on their way from berkeley their information is the subject of this letter and is exceedingly distressing to me inasmuch as i have not the means of affording immediate relief by them i learn that the remaining negros of my deceased brother samuels estate are under an execution and a momentary sale of them may be expected and this too by the extraordinary conduct of mr white in applying moneys received towards the discharge of a bond not in suit when they ought to have given it in payment of mr alexanders claim on which judgment had been or was on the point of being obtained how in the name of heaven came mr white to be vested with powers to dispose of the money he should recover unaccompanied     with instructions respecting the disposal will not mr alexander when he sees every exertion making to pay him have mercy on the orphan can he as a father and man of feeling see the fatherless reduced from competency to distress untouched if there was an unwillingness to pay him if property had not been sold for the express purpose of doing it and if there was not a prospect of its being done in a very short time it would be right in mr alexander to push matters to extremity but when as i am informed in the case every exertion is making to satisfy him to cause perhaps three pounds worth of property to be sold to raise  0 cash this would be inconsistent with that benevolence which should be characteristic of every man and to which from what i have heard of the gentleman he is justly intitled i therefore think as executor to the will and guardian to the boys you should before the dye is cast apply by fair and candid representation to mr alexander on this subject not in the cold mode of letter but personally to see if this evil cannot be averted vain would it be for me to offer mr alexander any assurances of the money at a short given day i cannot get it from those who owe me without suit and i hate to sue them i have offered lands for sale at very moderate prices but have not been able to sell them otherwise or if i could raise the money by any other means i would relieve my nephews without hesitation from the impending evil indeed i would essay any thing to save the estate for if the negros are sold for ready money they will go for a     song to add aught to this is unnecessary with the most affectionate regards my love in which mrs washington joins to my sister and the family george washington    february      mount vernon mary washington to mrs mary washington mount vernon    february      hond madam in consequence of your communication to george washington of your want of money i take the first safe conveyance by mr john dandridge to send you    guineas which believe me is all i have and which indeed ought to have been paid many days ago to another agreeable to my own assurances i have now demands upon me for more than  00£ three hundred and forty odd of which is due for the tax of      and i know not where or when i shall receive one shilling with which to pay it in the last two years i made no crops in the first i was obliged to buy corn and this year have none to sell and my wheat is so bad i cannot neither eat it myself nor sell it to others and tobacco i make none those who owe me money cannot or will not pay it without suits and to sue is to do nothing whilst my expences not from any extravagance or an inclination on my part to live splendidly but for the absolute support of my family and the visitors who are constantly here are exceedingly high higher indeed than i can support without selling part of my estate which i am disposed to do rather than run in debt or continue to be     so but this i cannot do without taking much less than the lands i have offered for sale are worth this is really and truely my situation i do not however offer it as any excuse for not paying you what may really be due for let this be little or much i am willing however unable to pay to the utmost farthing but it is really hard upon me when you have taken every thing you wanted from the plantation by which money could be raised when i have not received one farthing directly nor indirectly from the place for more than twelve years if ever and when in that time i have paid as appears by mr lund washingtons accounts against me during my absence two hundred and sixty odd pounds and by my own account fifty odd pounds out of my own pocket to you besides if i am rightly informed every thing that has been raised by the crops on the plantation who to blame or whether any body is to blame for these things i know not but these are facts and as the purposes for which i took the estate are not answered nor likely to be so but dissatisfaction on all sides have taken place i do not mean to have any thing more to say to your plantation or negros since the first of january except the fellow who is here and who will not as he has formed connections in this neighborhood leave it as experience has proved him i will hire of this my intention i informed my brother john sometime ago whose death i sincerely lament on many accounts and on this painful event condole with you most sincerely i do not mean by this declaration to withhold any aid or support i can     give from you for whilst i have a shilling left you shall have part if it is wanted whatever my own distresses may be what i shall then give i shall have credit for now i have not for tho i have received nothing from your quarter and am told that every farthing goes to you and have moreover paid between   and   hundred pounds besides out of my own pocket i am viewed as a delinquent and considsidered perhaps by the world as an unjust and undutiful son my advice to you therefore is to do one of two things with the plantation either let your grandson bushrod washington to whom the land is given by his father have the whole interest there that is lands and negros at a reasonable rent or next year for i presume it is too late this as the overseer may be engaged to let him have the land at a certain yearly rent during your life and hire out the negros this would ease you of all care and trouble make your income certain and your support ample further my sincere and pressing advice to you is to break up housekeeping hire out all the rest of your servants except a man and a maid and live with one of your children this would relieve you entirely from the cares of this world and leave your mind at ease to reflect undisturbedly on that which ought to come on this subject i have been full with my brother john and it was determined he should endeavor to get you to live with him he alas is no more and three only of us remain my house is at your service and i would press you most sincerely and most devoutly to accept it but i     am sure and candor requires me to say it will never answer your purposes in any shape whatsoever for in truth it may be compared to a well resorted tavern as scarcely any strangers who are going from north to south or from south to north do not spend a day or two at it this would were you to be an inhabitant of it oblige you to do one of   things  st to be always dressing to appear in company  d to come into the room in a dishabille or  d to be as it were a prisoner in your own chamber the first yould not like indeed for a person at your time of life it would be too fatiguing the  d i should not like because those who resort here are as i observed before strangers and people of the first distinction and the  d more than probably would not be pleasing to either of us nor indeed could you be retired in any room in my house for what with the sitting up of company the noise and bustle of servants and many other things you would not be able to enjoy that calmness and serenity of mind which in my opinion you ought now to prefer to every other consideration in life if you incline to follow this advice the house and lots on which you now live you may rent and enjoy the benefit of the money arising therefrom as long as you live this with the rent of the land at the little falls and the hire of your negros would bring you in an income which would be much more than sufficient to answer all your wants and make ample amends to the child you live with for myself i should desire nothing if it did not i would most cheerfully contribute more a man a maid the phaeton and     two horses are all you would want to lay in a sufficiency for the support of these would not require ¼ of your income the rest would purchase every necessary you could possibly want and place it in your power to be serviceable to those with whom you may live which no doubt would be agreeable to all parties there are such powerful reasons in my mind for giving this advice that i cannot help urging it with a degree of earnestness which is uncommon for me to do it is i am convinced the only means by which you can be happy the cares of a family without any body to assist you the charge of an estate the profits of which depend upon wind weather a good overseer an honest man and a thousand other circumstances cannot be right or proper at your advanced age and for me who am absolutely prevented from attending to my own plantations which are almost within call of me to attempt the care of yours would be folly in the extreme but by the mode i have pointed out you may reduce your income to a certainty be eased of all trouble and if you are so disposed may be perfectly happy for happiness depends more upon the internal frame of a persons own mind than on the externals in the world of the last if you will pursue the plan here recommended i am sure you can want nothing that is essential the other depends wholly upon yourself for the riches of the indies cannot purchase it mrs washington george and fanny join me in every good wish for you and i am honored madame your most dutiful and aff son     george washington    february      mount vernon thomas stone to thomas stone  mount vernon    february      dear sir your favor of the  0th ultimo came duly to hand to give an opinion in a cause of so much importance as that which has warmly agitated two branches of your legislature and which from the appeal that is made is likely to create great and perhaps dangerous divisions is rather a delicate matter but as this diversity of opinion is on a subject which has i believe occupied the minds of most men and as my sentiments thereon have been fully and decidedly expressed long before the assembly either of maryland or this state were convened i do not scruple to declare that if i had a voice in your legislature it would have been given decidedly against a paper emission upon the general principles of its utility as a representative and the necessity of it as a medium    0 and as far as i have been able to understand its advocates for the two papers you sent me were the same and contained no reasons of the house of delegates for the local want of it in your state though i have seen and given them a cursory reading elsewhere i should have been very little less opposed to it to assign reasons for this opinion would be as unnecessary as tedious the ground has been so often trod that a place hardly remains untouched but in a word the necessity arising from a want of specie is represented as greater than it really is i contend that it is by the substance not with the shadow of a thing we are to be benefitted the wisdom of man in my humble opinion cannot at this time devise a plan by which the credit of paper money would be long supported consequently depreciation keeps pace with the quantity of the emission and articles for which it is exchanged rise in a greater ratio than the sinking value of the money wherein then is the farmer the planter the artisan benefitted the debtor may     be because as i have observed he gives the shadow in lieu of the substance and in proportion to his gain the creditor or the body politic suffer whether it be a legal tender or not it will as hath been observed very truly leave no alternative it must be that or nothing an evil equally great is the door it immediately opens for speculation by which the least designing and perhaps most valuable part of the community are preyed upon by the more knowing and crafty speculators but contrary to my intention and declaration i am offering reasons in support of my opinion reasons too which of all others are least pleasing to the advocates for paper money i shall therefore only observe generally that so many people have suffered by former emissions that like a burnt child who dreads the fire no person will touch it who can possibly avoid it the natural consequence of which will be that the specie which remains unexported will be instantly locked up with great esteem and regard i am dear sir c george washington   march      mount vernon david humphreys to colonel david humphreys mount vernon   march      my dear humphreys colo wadsworth as i informed you in my last presented me your obliging favor of the  0th of january and the post since has handed me the subsequent one of the   th ulto my sentiments respecting the inexpediency of my attending the proposed convention of the states in     philadelphia remain the same as when i wrote you last tho congress i am informed are about to remove one of the objections by their recommendation of this convention i am still indirectly and delicately pressed by many to attend this meeting and a thought has run thro my mind of late attended with more embarrassment than any former one it is whether my not doing it will not be considered as an implied dereliction to republicanism—nay more whether however injurious the imputation it may not be ascribed to other motives my wish is i confess to see this convention tied tried after which if the present form is not made efficient conviction of the propriety of a change will pervade all ranks and many may be effected by peace till then however necessary it may appear to the more discerning part of the community my opinion is that it cannot be accomplished without great contention and much confusion for reasons too obvious to enumerate it is one of the evils perhaps not the smallest of democratical governments that they must feel before they will see or act under this view of matters and not doubting but you have heard the sentiments of many respectable characters since the date of your letter of the  0th of january on this subject and perhaps since the business has been moved in congress of the propriety or impropriety of my attendance let me pray you my dear sir to give me confidentially the public opinion and expectation as far as it has come to your knowledge of what it is supposed i will or ought to do on this occasion you will readily see     the necessity of my receiving it soon if it is to have an operation contrary to the former because my communications to the executive of this state are not considered as definitive i must make these so shortly         george washington  0 march      mount vernon john jay to john jay mount vernon  0 march      dear sir i stand indebted to you for two letters the first introductory of mr anstey needed no apology nor will any be necessary on future similar occasions the other of the   th of january is on a very interesting subject deserving very particular attention how far the revision of the federal system and giving more adequate powers to congress may be productive of an efficient government i will not under my present view of the matter presume to decide—that many inconveniences result from the     present form none can deny those enumerated in your letter are so obvious and sensibly felt that no logic can controvert nor is it likely that any change of conduct will remove them and that attempts to alter or amend it will be like the proppings of a house which is ready to fall and which no shoars can support as many seem to think may also be true but is the public mind matured for such an important change as the one you have suggested what would be the consequences of a premature attempt my opinion is that this country must yet feel and see more before it can be accomplished a thirst for power and the bantling i had liked to have said monster for sovereignty which have taken such fast hold of the states individually will when joined by the many whose personal consequence in the control of state politics will in a manner be annihilated form a strong phalanx against it and when to these the few who can hold posts of honor or profit in the national government are compared with the many who will see but little prospect of being noticed and the discontent of others who may look for appointments the opposition will be altogether irresistable till the mass as well as the more discerning part of the community shall see the necessity among men of reflection few will be found i believe who are not beginning to think that our system is more perfect in theory than in practice and that notwithstanding the boasted virtue of america it is more than probable we shall exhibit the last melancholy proof that mankind are not competent to their     own government without the means of coercion in the sovereign yet i would fain try what the wisdom of the proposed convention will suggest and what can be effected by their councils it may be the last peaceable mode of essaying the practicability of the present form without a greater lapse of time than the exigency of our affairs will allow in strict propriety a convention so holden may not be legal congress however may give it a coloring by recommendation which would fit it more to the taste without proceeding to a definition of the powers this however constitutionally it might be done would not in my opinion be expedient for delicacy on the one hand and jealousy on the other would produce a mere nihil my name is in the delegation to this convention but it was put there contrary to my desire and remains contrary to my request several reasons at the time of this appointment and which yet exist conspired to make an attendance inconvenient perhaps improper tho a good deal urged to it with sentiments of great regard and friendship c p s since writing this letter i have seen the resolution of congress recommendatory of the convention to be holden in philadelphia the  d monday in may      george washington    march      mount vernon benjamin lincoln to majorgeneral benjamin lincoln mount vernon    march      my dear sir ever since the disorders in your state began to grow serious i have been peculiarly anxious to hear from that quarter general knox has from time to time transmitted to me the state of affairs as they came to his hands but nothing has given such full and satisfactory information as the particular detail of events which you have been so good as to favor me with and for which you will please to accept my warmest and most grateful acknowledgments permit me also my dear sir to offer you my sincerest congratulations upon your success the suppression of those tumults and insurrections with so little bloodshed is an event as happy as it was unexpected it must have been peculiarly agreeable to you being placed in so delicate and critical a situation i am extremely happy to find that your sentiments upon the disfranchising act are such as they are upon my first seeing it i formed an opinion perfectly coincident with yours vizt that measures more generally lenient might have produced equally as good an effect without entirely alienating the affections of the people     from the government as it now stands it affects a large body of men some of them perhaps it deprives of the means of gaining a livelihood the friends and connections of those people will feel themselves wounded in a degree and i think it will rob the state of a number of its inhabitants if it produces nothing more    george washington    march      mount vernon edmund randolph to edmund randolph governor of virginia mount vernon    march      dear sir your favor of the   th did not come to my hand till the   th and since then till now i have been too much indisposed to acknowledge the receipt of it  to what cause to ascribe the detention of the letter i know not as i never omit sending once and often twice a week to the post office in alexandria it was the decided intention of the letter i had the honor of writing to your excellency the   st of december last to inform you that it was not convenient for me to attend the convention proposed to be holden at philadelphia in may next and i had entertained hopes that another had been or soon would be     appointed in my place inasmuch as it is not only inconvenient for me to leave home but because there will be i apprehend too much cause to arraign my conduct with inconsistency in again appearing on a public theatre after a public declaration to the contrary and because it will i fear have a tendency to sweep me back into the tide of public affairs when retirement and ease is so essentially necessary for and is so much desired by me however as my friends with a degree of solicitude which is unusual seem to wish for my attendance on this occasion i have come to a resolution to go if my health will permit provided from the lapse of time between the date of your excellencys letter and this reply the executive may not the reverse of which would be highly pleasing to me have turned their thoughts to some other character for independently of all other considerations i have of late been so much afflicted with a rheumatic complaint in my shoulder that at times i am hardly able to raise my hand to my head or turn myself in bed this consequently might prevent my attendance and eventually a representation of the state which would afflict me more sensibly than the disorder that occasioned it if after the expression of these sentiments the executive should consider me as one of the delegates i would thank your excellency for the earliest advice of it because if i am able and should go to philadelphia i shall have some previous arrangement to make and would set off for that place the  st or  d of may that i might be there in time to account   0 personally for my conduct to the general meeting of the cincinnati which is to convene the first monday of that month my feelings would be much hurt if that body should otherwise ascribe my attending the one and not the other occasion to a disrespectful inattention to the society when the fact is that i shall ever retain the most lively and affectionate regard for the members of which it is composed on account of their attachment to me and uniform support upon many trying occasions as well as on account of their public virtues patriotism and sufferings i hope your excellency will be found among the attending delegates i should be glad to be informed who the others are and cannot conclude without once more and in emphatical terms praying that if there is not a decided representation in prospect without me another may be chosen in my room without ceremony and without delay for the reason already assigned for it would be unfortunate indeed if the state which was the mover of this convention should be unrepresented in it with great respect i have the honor to be your excellencys most obedient servant george washington    march      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress  mount vernon    march      my dear sir at the same time that i acknowledge the receipt of your obliging favor of the   st ultimo from new york i promise to avail myself of your indulgence     to write only when it is convenient to me if this should not occasion a relaxation on your part i shall become very much your debtor and possibly like others in similar circumstances when the debt is burthensome may feel a disposition to apply the sponge or what is nearly akin to it pay you off in depreciated paper which being a legal tender or what is tantamount being that or nothing you cannot refuse you will receive the nominal value and that you know quiets the conscience and makes all things easy with the debtor i am glad to find that congress have recommended to the states to appear in the convention proposed to be holden in philadelphia next may i think the reasons in favor have the preponderancy over those against it it is idle in my opinion to suppose that the sovereign can be insensible to the inadequacy of the powers under which they act and that seeing it they should not recommend a revision of the federal system especially when it is considered by many as the only constitutional mode by which the defects can be remedied had congress proceeded to a delineation of the powers it might have sounded an alarm but as the case is i do not conceive that it will have that effect  from the acknowledged abilities of the secretary for foreign affairs i have no doubt of his having     ably investigated the infractions of the treaty on both sides much is it to be regretted however that there should have been any on ours we seem to have forgot or never to have learnt the policy of placing ones enemy in the wrong had we observed good faith on our part we might have told our tale to the world with a good grace but complaints illy become those who are found to be the first aggressors i am fully of opinion that those who lean to a monarchical government have either not consulted the public mind or that they live in a region which the levelling principles in which they were bred being entirely eradicated is much more productive of monarchical ideas than are to be found in the southern states where from the habitual distinctions which have always existed among the people one would have expected the first generation and the most rapid growth of them i am also clear that even admitting the utility nay necessity of the form yet that the period is not arrived for adopting the change without shaking the peace of this country to its foundation that a thorough reform of the present system is indispensable none who have capacities to judge will deny and with hand and heart i hope the business will be essayed in a full convention after which if more powers and more decision is not found in the existing form if it still wants energy and that secrecy and despatch either from the nonattendance or the local views of its members which is characteristic of good government and if it shall be found the contrary of which however i have     always been more afraid of than of the abuse of them that congress will upon all proper occasions exert the powers which are given with a firm and steady hand instead of frittering them back to the states where the members in place of viewing themselves in their national character are too apt to be looking—i say after this essay is made if the system proves inefficient conviction of the necessity of a change will be disseminated among all classes of the people then and not till then in my opinion can it be attempted without involving all the evils of civil discord i confess however that my opinion of public virtue is so far changed that i have my doubts whether any system without the means of coercion in the sovereign will enforce due obedience to the ordinances of a general government without which every thing else fails laws or ordinances unobserved or partially attended to had better never have been made because the first is a mere nihil and the second is productive of much jealousy and discontent but what kind of coercion you may ask this indeed will require thought though the noncompliance of the states with the late requisition is an evidence of the necessity it is somewhat singular that a state new york which used to be foremost in all federal measures should now turn her face against them in almost every instance i fear the state of massachusetts has exceeded the bounds of good policy in its disfranchisements punishment is certainly due to the disturbers of a government but the operation of this act is too extensive     it embraces too much and probably will give birth to new instead of destroying the old leaven some acts passed at the last session of our assembly respecting the trade of this country have given great and general discontent to the merchants an application from the whole body of them at norfolk to the governor has been made it is said to convene the assembly i had written thus far and was at the point of telling you how much i am your obliged servant when your favor of the   th ultimo calls upon me for additional acknowledgments i thank you for the indian vocabulary which i dare say will be very acceptable in a general comparison having taken a copy i return you the original with thanks it gives me great pleasure to hear that there is a probability of a full representation of the states in convention but if the delegates come to it under fetters the salutary ends proposed will in my opinion be greatly embarrassed and retarded if not altogether defeated i am desirous of knowing how this matter is as my wish is that the convention may adopt no temporizing expedients but probe the defects of the constitution to the bottom and provide a radical cure whether they are agreed to or not a conduct of this kind will stamp wisdom and dignity on their proceedings and hold up a light which sooner or later will have its influence      i should feel pleasure i confess in hearing that vermont is received into the union upon terms agreeable to all parties i took the liberty years ago to tell some of the first characters in the state of new york that sooner or later it would come to this that the longer it was delayed the terms on their part would probably be more difficult and that the general interest was suffering by the suspense in which the business was held as the asylum which it afforded was a constant drain from the army in place of an aid which it would have afforded and lastly considering the proximity of it to canada if they were not with us they might become a sore thorn in our side which i verily believe would have been the case if the war had continued the western settlements without good and wise management may be equally troublesome with sentiments of sincere friendship i am c     george washington   april      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon   april      my dear sir the early attention which you were so obliging as to pay to my letter of the  th ultimo is highly pleasing and flattering were you to continue to give me information on the same point you would add to the favor as i see or think i see reasons for and against my attendance in convention so near an equilibrium as will cause me to determine upon either with diffidence one of the reasons against it is a fear that all the states will not be represented as some of them appear to have been unwillingly drawn into the measure their delegates will come with such fetters as will embarrass and perhaps render nugatory the whole proceeding in either of these circumstances that is a partial representation or cramped powers i should not like to be a sharer in the business if the delegates assemble with such powers as will enable the convention to probe the defects of the constitution to the bottom and point out radical cures it would be an honorable employment but not otherwise these are matters you may possibly come at by means of your acquaintance with the delegates in congress who undoubtedly know what powers are given by their respective states you also can inform me what is the prevailing opinion with respect to my attendance or nonattendance and i would sincerely thank you for the confidential communication of it if i should attend the convention i will be in philadelphia previous to the meeting of the cincinnati     where i shall hope and expect to meet you and some others of my particular friends the day before in order that i may have a free and unreserved conference with you on the subject of it for i assure you this is in my estimation a business of a delicate nature that the design of the institution was pure i have not a particle of doubt that it may be so still is perhaps equally unquestionable but is not the subsiding of the jealousies respecting it to be ascribed to the modifications which took place at the last general meeting are not these rejected in toto by some of the state societies and partially acceded to by others has any state so far overcome its prejudices as to grant a charter will the modifications and alterations be insisted on in the next meeting or given up if the first will it not occasion warmth and divisions if the latter and i should remain at the head of this order in what light would my signature appear in recommendations having different tendencies in what light will this versatility appear to the foreign members who perhaps are acting agreeably to the recommendation these and other matters which may be agitated will i fear place me in a disagreeable situation if i should attend the meeting and were among the causes which induced me to decline previously the honor of the presidency indeed my health is become very precarious a rheumatic complaint which has followed me more than six months is frequently so bad that it is sometimes with difficulty i can raise my hand to my head or turn myself in bed this     however smooth and agreeable other matters might be might almost in the moment of my departure prevent my attendance on either occasion i will not at present touch upon any other points of your letter but will wish you to ponder on all these matters and write to me as soon as you can with sentiments of the sincerest friendship i am your most affectionate c george washington    april      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon    april      my dear sir after every consideration my judgment was able to give the subject i had determined to yield to the wishes of many of my friends who seemed anxious for my attending the convention which is proposed to be holden in philadelphia the  d monday of may and though so much afflicted with a rheumatick complaint of which i have not been entirely free for six months as to be under the necessity of carrying my arm in a sling for the last ten days i had fixed on monday next for my departure and had made every necessary arrangement for the purpose when within this hour i am called by an express who assures me not a moment is to be lost to see a mother and only sister who are supposed to be in the agonies of death expire  and i am hastening to obey this     melancholy call after having just buried a brother who was the intimate companion of my youth and the friend of my ripened age  this journey of mine then  00 miles in the disordered frame of my body will i am persuaded unfit me for the intended trip to philadelphia and assuredly prevent my offering that tribute of respect to my compatriots in arms which results from affection and gratitude for their attachment to and support of me upon so many trying occasions for this purpose it was as i had tho with a good deal of reluctance consented from a conviction that our affairs were verging fast to ruin to depart from the resolution i had taken of never more stepping out of the walks of private life that i determined to shew my respect to the general meeting of the society by coming there the week before as the latter is prevented and the other it is probable will not take place i send such papers as have occasionally come to my hands and may require the inspection and the consideration of the cincinnati an apology for the order in which they are sent is highly necessary and my present situation is the best i can offer to morrow i had set apart for the inspection and arrangement of them that such only as were fitting might be laid before the society for unless i had time to go over them again with a person who understands the french language i am not even certain that all of what i send may relate to the affairs of the cincinnati and certain i am that some are too personal   0 the sending of which will not i hope be ascribed to improper motives when the only one i had as i am in the moment of my departure from home and uncertain of returning to it is that nothing which has been referred to me may be with held—    george washington   may      mount vernon lund washington to lund washington mount vernon   may         i need not tell you because a moments

water considerably there was no fording it safely i was reduced to the necessity therefore of remaining on the other side or of attempting to cross on an old rotten  long disused bridge being anxious to get on i prefered the latter and in the attempt one of my horses fell fifteen feet at least the other very near following which had it happened would have taken the carriage with baggage along with him and destroyed the whole effectually however by prompt assistance of some people at a mill just by and great exertion the first horse was disengaged from his harness the  d prevented from going quite through and drawn off and the carriage secured from hurt     thursday  0th—sett off after an early breakfast crossed the susquehanna and dined in havre de gras at the house of one rogers—and

 philadelphia thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson philadelphia  0 may      dear sir       i come now to the other part of your letter which concerns the cincinnati on which indeed i scarcely know what to say it is a delicate it is a perplexing subject not having the extract from the encyclopedia before me i cannot now undertake to enter into the merits of the publication  it may therefore be as much as will be expected from me to observe that the author appears in general to have detailed very candidly and ingenuously the motives and inducements which give birth to the society some of the subsequent facts which i cannot however     from memory pretend to discuss with precision are thought by gentlemen who have seen the publication to be misstated insomuch that it is commonly said truth and falsehood are so intimately blended that it will become very difficult to sever them for myself i only recollect two or three circumstances in the narration of which palpable mistakes seem to have insinuated themselves monsieur lenfant did not arrive and bring the eagles during the session of the general meeting but some time before that convention the legislature of rhode island never passed any act whatever on the subject that ever came to my knowledge notwithstanding what mirabeau and others had previously advanced nothing can be more ridiculous than the supposition of the author that the society was instituted partly because the country could not then pay the army except the assertion that the united states have now made full and complete provision for paying not only the arrearages due to the officers but the halfpay or commutation at their option from whence the author deduces an argument for its dissolution i conceive this never had any thing to do with the institution yet the officers in most of the states who never have nor i believe expect to receive one farthing of the principal or interest on their final settlement securities would be much obliged to the author to convince them how and when they received a compensation for their services no foreigner or american who has been absent some time will easily comprehend how tender those concerned are     on this point i am sorry to say a great many of the officers consider me as having in a degree committed myself by inducing them to trust too much in the justice of their country they heartily wish no settlement had been made because it has rendered them obnoxious to their fellow citizens without affording them the least emolument for the reason i first mentioned i cannot think it expedient for me to go into an investigation of the writers deductions i shall accordingly content myself with giving you some idea of the part i have acted posterior to the first formation of the association when i found that you and many of the most respectable characters in the country would entirely acquiesce with the institution as altered and amended in the first general meeting of      and that the objections against the hereditary and other obnoxious parts were wholly done away i was prevailed upon to accept the presidency happy in finding so far as i could learn by assiduous inquiry that all the clamors and jealousies which had been excited against the original association had ceased i judged it a proper time in the last autumn to withdraw myself from any farther agency in the business and to make my retirement complete agreeably to my original plan i wrote circular letters to all the state societies announcing my wishes informing that i did not propose to be at the general meeting and requested not to be reëlected president this was the last step of a public nature i expected ever to have taken but having since been appointed by     my native state to attend the national convention and having been pressed to a compliance in a manner which it hardly becomes me to describe i have in a measure been obliged to sacrifice my own sentiments and to be present in philadelphia at the very time of the general meeting of the cincinnati after which i was not at liberty to decline the presidency without placing myself in an extremely disagreeable situation with relation to that brave and faithful class of men whose persevering patriotism and friendship i had experienced on so many trying occasions the business of this convention is as yet too much in embryo to form any opinion of the conclusion much is expected from it by some not much by others and nothing by a few that something is necessary none will deny for the situation of the general government if it can be called a government is shaken to its foundation and liable to be overturned by every blast in a word it is at an end and unless a remedy is soon applied anarchy and confusion will inevitably ensue but having greatly exceeded the bounds of a letter i will only add assurances of that esteem regard and respect with which i have the honor to be c george washington   july      philadelphia david stuart to david stuart philadelphia   july      dear sir i have been favored with your letter of the   th ultimo    rhode island from our last accts still perseveres   0 in that impolitic unjust and one might add without much impropriety scandalous conduct which seems to have marked all her public councils of late consequently no representation is yet here from thence new hampshire tho delegates have been appointed is also unrepresented various causes have been assigned whether well or illfounded i shall not take upon me to decide the fact however is that they are not here political contests and want of money are amidst the reasons assigned for the nonattendance of the members as the rules of the convention prevent me from relating any of the proceedings of it and the gazettes contain more fully than i could detail other occurrences of a public nature i have little to communicate to you on the article of news happy indeed would it be if the convention shall be able to recommend such a firm and permanent government for this union that all who live under it may be secure in their lives liberty and property and thrice happy would it be if such a recommendation should obtain every body wishes every body expects something from the convention but what will be the final result of its deliberation the book of fate must disclose persuaded i am that the primary cause of all our disorders lies in the different state governments and in the tenacity of that power which pervades the whole of their systems whilst independent sovereignty is so ardently contended for whilst the local views of each state and separate interests by which they are too much governed will not yield     to a more enlarged scale of politics incompatibility in the laws of different states and disrespect to those of the general government must render the situation of this great country weak inefficient and disgraceful it has already done so almost to the final dissolution of it weak at home and disregarded abroad is our present condition and contemptible enough it is entirely unnecessary was it to offer any apology for the sentiments you were so obliging as to offer me i have had no wish more ardent through the whole progress of this business than that of knowing what kind of government is best calculated for us to live under no doubt there will be a diversity of sentiments on this important subject and to inform the judgment it is necessary to hear all arguments that can be advanced to please all is impossible and to attempt it would be vain the only way therefore is under all the views in which it can be placed and with a due consideration to circumstances habits c c to form such a government as will bear the scrutinizing eye of criticism and trust it to the good sense and patriotism of the people to carry it into effect demagogues men who are unwilling to lose any of their state consequence and interested characters in each will oppose any general government but let these be regarded rightly and justice it is to be hoped will at length prevail my best wishes attend mrs stuart yourself and the girls if i can render any service whilst i remain here i shall be happy in doing it i am c     george washington  0 july      philadelphia alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton philadelphia  0 july      dear sir i thank you for your communication of the  d when i refer you to the state of the counsels which prevailed at the period you left this city and add that they are now if possible in a worse train than ever you will find but little ground on which the hope of a good establishment can be formed in a word i almost despair of seeing a favorable issue to the proceedings of our convention and do therefore repent having had any agency in the business the men who oppose a strong and energetic government are in my opinion narrowminded politicians or are under the influence of local views the apprehension expressed by them that the people will not accede to the form proposed is the ostensible not the real cause of opposition but admitting that the present sentiment is as they prognosticate the proper question ought nevertheless to be is it or is it not the best form that such a country as this can adopt if it be the best recommend it and it will assuredly obtain maugre opposition i am sorry you went away i wish you were back the crisis is equally important and alarming and no opposition under such circumstances should discourage exertions till the signature is offered i will not at this time trouble you with more than my best wishes and sincere regard i am dear sir c      george washington    july      philadelphia richard henry lee to richard henry lee philadelphia    july      dear sir i have had the honor to receive your favor of the   th instant and thank you for the ordinance which was enclosed in it my sentiments with respect to the navigation of the mississippi have been long fixed and are not dissimilar to those which are expressed in your letter i have ever been of opinion that the true policy of the atlantic states would be instead of contending prematurely for the free navigation of that river which eventually and perhaps as soon as it shall be our true interest to obtain it must happen to open and improve the natural communications with the western country through which the produce of it might be transported with convenience and ease to our markets till you get low down the ohio i conceive that it would considering the length of the voyage to new orleans the difficulty of the current and the time necessary to perform it in be the interest     of the inhabitants to bring their produce to our ports and sure i am there is no other tie by which they will long form a link in the chain of federal union i believe however from the temper in which those people appear to be and from the ambitious and turbulent spirit of some of their demagogues that it has become a moot point to determine when every circumstance which attends this business is brought into view what is best to be done the state of virginia having taken the matter up with so high a hand is not among the least embarrassing or disagreeable parts of the difficulty    i have the honor to be c  george washington    september      mount vernon patrick henry to patrick henry mount vernon    september      dear sir in the first moment after my return i take the liberty of sending you a copy of the constitution which the federal convention has submitted to the people of these states i accompany it with no     observations your own judgment will at once discover the good and the exceptionable parts of it and your experience of the difficulties which have ever arisen when attempts have been made to reconcile such variety of interests and local prejudices as pervade the several states will render explanation unnecessary i wish the constitution which is offered had been made more perfect but i sincerely believe it is the best that could be obtained at this time and as a constitutional door is opened for amendment hereafter the adoption of it under the present circumstances of the union is in my opinion desirable from a variety of concurring accounts it appears to me that the political concerns of this country are in a manner suspended by a thread and that the convention has been looked up to by the reflecting part of the community with a solicitude which is hardly to be conceived and if nothing had been agreed on by that body anarchy would soon have ensued the seeds being deeply sown in every soil i am c      george washington  0 october      mount vernon david humphreys to colonel david humphreys mount vernon  0 october      my dear humphreys your favor of the   th ulto came duly to hand as did the former of june with great pleasure i received the intimation of your spending the winter under this roof—the invitation was not less sincere than the reception will be cordial the only stipulations i shall contend for are that in all things you shall do as you please—i will do the same and that no ceremony may be used or any restraint be imposed on any one the constitution that is submitted is not free from imperfections but there are as few radical defects in it as could well be expected considering the heterogenious mass of which the convention was composed and the diversity of interests that are to be attended to as a constitutional door is opened for     future amendments and alterations i think it would be wise in the people to accept what is offered to them and i wish it may be by as great a majority of them as it was by that of the convention but this is hardly to be expected because the importance and sinister views of too many characters will be affected by the change—much will depend however upon literary abilities and the recommendation of it by good pens should be openly i mean publickly afforded in the gazettes—go matters however as they may i shall have the consolation to reflect that no objects but the public good—and that peace and harmony which i wished to see prevail in the convention obtruded even for a moment in my bosom during the whole session long as it was—what reception this state will give to the proceedings in all its extent of territory is more than i can inform you of in these parts it is advocated beyond my expectation—the great opposition if great there should be will come from the southern and western counties from whence i have not as yet received any accounts that are to be depended on i condole with you on the loss of your parents but as they lived to a good old age you could not be unprepared for the shock tho it is painful to bid an everlasting adieu to those we love or revere—reason religion and philosophy may soften the anguish of it but time alone can eradicate it as i am beginning to look for you i shall add no more in this letter but the wishes of the family and the affectionate regards of a sincere friend c     george washington  0 october      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress mount vernon  0 october      my dear sir i thank you for your letter of the  0th ultimo it came by the last post i am better pleased that the proceedings of the convention are submitted from congress by a unanimous vote feeble as it is than if they had appeared under strong marks of approbation without it this apparent unanimity will have its effect not every one has opportunities to peep behind the curtain and as the multitude are often deceived by externals the appearance of unanimity in that body on this occasion will be of great importance the political tenets of colo mason and colo r h lee are always in unison it may be asked which of them gives the tone without hesitation i answer the latter because i believe the latter will receive it from no one he has i am informed rendered himself obnoxious in philadelphia by the pains he took to disseminate his objections amongst some of the leaders of the seceding members of the legislature of that state his conduct is not less reprobated in this country how it will be relished generally is yet to be learnt by me  as far as accounts have been received from the     southern and western counties the sentiment with respect to the proceedings of the convention is favorable whether the knowledge of this or conviction of the impropriety of withholding the constitution from state conventions has worked most in the breast of colonel mason i will not decide but the fact is he has declared unequivocally in a letter to me for its going to the people had his sentiments however been opposed to the measure his instructions which are given by the freeholders of this county to their representatives would have secured his vote for it yet i have no doubt but that his assent will be accompanied by the most tremendous apprehensions which the highest coloring can give to his objections to alarm the people seems to be the groundwork of his plan the want of a qualified navigation act is already declared to be a mean by which the price of produce in the southern states will be reduced to nothing and will become monopoly of the eastern and northern states to enumerate the whole of his objections is unnecessary because they are detailed in the address of the seceding members of the assembly of pennsylvania which no doubt you have seen  i scarcely think any powerful opposition will be made to the constitutions being submitted to a convention of the people of this state if it is given it will be there at which i hope you will make it convenient to be present explanations will be wanting and none can give them with more accuracy and propriety   0 than yourself the sentiments of mr henry with respect to the constitution are not known in these parts mr joseph jones who it seems was in alexandria before the convention broke up was of opinion that they would not be inimical to the proceedings of it others think as the advocate of a paper emission he cannot be friendly to a constitution which is an effectual bar from circumstances which have been related it is conjectured that the governor  wishes he had been among the subscribing members but time will disclose more than we know at present with respect to the whole of the business and when i hear more i will write to you again in the mean while i pray you to be assured of the sincere regard and affection with which i am my dear sir c p s having received in a letter from colonel mason a detail in writing of his objections to the proposed constitution i enclose you a copy of them      george washington october      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon october      my dear sir your favor of the  d instant came duly to hand the fourth day after leaving philadelphia i reached home and found mrs washington and the family tolerably well but the fruits of the earth almost entirely destroyed by one of the severest droughts in this neighborhood that has ever been experienced the crops pretty generally have been injured in this state below the mountains but not to the degree that mine and some others in a small circle around me have suffered the constitution is now before the judgmentseat it has as was expected its adversaries and supporters which will preponderate is yet to be decided the former more than probably will be most active as the major part of them will it is to be feared be governed by sinister and selfimportant motives to which every thing in their breasts must yield the opposition from another class of them may perhaps if they should be men of reflection candor and information subside in the solution of the following     simple questions   is the constitution which is submitted by the convention preferable to the government if it can be called one under which we now live   is it probable that more confidence would at the time be placed in another convention provided the experiment should be tried than was placed in the last one and is it likely that a better agreement would take place therein what would be the consequences if these should not happen or even from the delay which must inevitably follow such an experiment is there not a constitutional door open for alterations or amendments and is it not likely that real defects will be as readily discovered after as before trial and will not our successors be as ready to apply the remedy as ourselves if occasion should require it to think otherwise will in my judgment be ascribing more of the amor patriæ more wisdom and more virtue to ourselves than i think we deserve it is highly probable that the refusal of our governor and colonel mason to subscribe to the proceedings of the convention will have a bad effect in this state for as you well observe they must not only assign reasons for the justification of their own conduct but it is highly probable that these reasons will be clothed in most terrific array for the purpose of alarming  some things are already addressed to the fears of the people and will no doubt have their effect     as far however as the sense of this part of the country has been taken it is strongly in favor of the proposed constitution further i cannot speak with precision if a powerful opposition is given to it the weight thereof will i apprehend come from the south side of james river and from the western counties i am c george washington    october      mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton mount vernon    october      dear sir your favor without date came to my hand by the last post it is with unfeigned concern i perceive that a political dispute has arisen between governor clinton and yourself for both of you i have the highest esteem and regard but as you say it is insinuated by some of your political adversaries and may obtain credit that you palmed yourself upon me and was dismissed from my family and call upon me to do you justice by a recital of the facts i do therefore explicitly declare that both charges are entirely unfounded with respect to the first i have no cause to believe that you took a single step to accomplish or had the most distant idea of receiving an appointment in my family till you were invited into it and with respect to the second that your quitting it was altogether the effect of your own choice when the situation of this country calls loudly for vigor and unanimity it is to be lamented that gentlemen of talents and character should disagree in their     sentiments for promoting the public weal but unfortunately this ever has been and most probably ever will be the case in the affairs of mankind having scarcely been from home since my return from philadelphia i can give little information with respect to the general reception of the new constitution in this state in alexandria however and some of the adjacent counties it was embraced with an enthusiastic warmth of which i had no conception i expect notwithstanding violent opposition will be given to it by some characters of weight and influence in the state mrs washington unites with me in best wishes to mrs hamilton and yourself i am c george washington    october      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress mount vernon    october      my dear sir when i wrote to you last i was possessed of very little information of the sentiments of this state on the new constitution beyond the circle of alexandria since by the last post i have received a letter from a member of the assembly in richmond  containing the following paragraphs i believe such an instance has not happened before since the revolution that there should be a house on the first day of the session and business immediately taken up this was not only the case on monday but there was a full house when mr prentiss was called up to the chair as speaker there being no opposition thus the session has commenced peaceably     it gives me much pleasure to inform you that the sentiments of the members are infinitely more favorable to the constitution than the most zealous advocates for it could have expected i have not met with one in all my inquiries and i have made them with great diligence opposed to it except mr henry who i have heard is so but could only conjecture it from a conversation with him on the subject other members who have also been active in their inquiries tell me that they have met with none opposed to it it is said however that old mr cabell of amherst disapproves of it mr nicholas has declared himself a warm friend to it the transmissory note of congress was before us to day when mr henry declared that it transcended our powers to decide on the constitution that it must go before a convention—as it was insinuated he would aim at preventing this much pleasure was discovered at the declaration thursday next the   th is fixed upon for taking up the question of calling the convention and fixing the time of its meeting in the mean time five thousand copies are ordered to be printed to be dispersed by the members in their respective counties for the information of the people i cannot forbear mentioning that the chancellor pendleton espouses the constitution so warmly as to declare he will give it his aid in a convention if his health will permit as there are few better judges of such subjects this must be deemed a fortunate circumstance as the above quotation is the sum of my information i shall add nothing more on the subject of the proposed government at this time mr c pinckney is unwilling i perceive by the enclosures contained in your favor of the   th to lose any fame that can be acquired by the publication of his sentiments if the subject of the navigation of the mississippi could have remained as silent and glided as gently down the stream of time for a while as the waters do that are contained within the     banks it would i confess have comported more with my ideas of sound policy than any decision that can be come to at this day with sentiments the most affectionate and friendly i am dear sir c george washington    october      mount vernon mathew carey to mathew carey mount vernon    october      sir the last post brought me your letter of the   d—your application to me for the loan of £ 00 is an evidence of your unacquaintedness with my inability to lend money to be candid—my expenditures are never behind my income—and this year occasioned by the severest drouth that ever was known in this neighborhood instead of selling grain which heretofore has been my principal source of revenue it is not £ 00 that will purchase enough for the support of my family—after this disclosure of my situation you will be readily persuaded that inclination to serve without the means of accomplishing it is of little avail—this however is the fact so far as it respects the point in question as you seem anxious that the contents of your letter should not be known i put it in your own power to destroy it by returning it under the same cover with this i wish sucess to your museum and am c      george washington  0 october      mount vernon archibald johnston to archibald johnston mount vernon  0 october      sir my fixed determination is that no person whatever shall hunt upon my grounds or waters—to grant leave to one and refuse another would not only be drawing a line of discrimination which would be offensive but would subject one to great inconvenience—for my strict and positive orders to all my people are if they hear a gun fired upon my land to go immediately in pursuit of it—permission therefore to any one would keep them either always in pursuit—or make them inattentive to my orders under the supposition of its belonging to a licensed person by which means i should be obtruded upon by others who to my cost i find had other objects in view besides as i have not lost my relish for this sport when i can find time to indulge myself in it and gentlemen who come to the house are pleased with it it is my wish not to have the game within my jurisdiction disturbed for these reasons i beg you will not take my refusal amiss because i would give the same to my brother if he lived off my land i am c     george washington   november      mount vernon arthur young to arthur young mount vernon   november            before i undertake to give the information you request respecting the arrangements of farms in this neighborhood c i must observe that there is perhaps scarcely any part of america where farming has been less attended to than in this state the cultivation of tobacco has been almost the sole object with men of landed property and consequently a regular course of crops have never been in view the general custom has been first to raise a crop of indian corn maize which according to the mode of cultivation is a good preparation for wheat then a crop of wheat after which the ground is respited except from weeds and every trash that can contribute to its foulness for about eighteen months and so on alternately without any dressing till the land is exhausted when it is turned out without being sown with grassseeds or any method taken to restore it and another piece is ruined in the same manner no more cattle is raised than can be supported by lowland meadows swamps c and the tops and blades of indian corn as very few persons have attended to sowing grasses and connecting cattle with their crops the indian corn is the chief support of the laborers and horses our lands as i mentioned in my first letter to you were originally very good but use and abuse have made them quite otherwise the above is the mode of cultivation which has     been generally pursued here but the system of husbandry which has been found so beneficial in england and which must be greatly promoted by your valuable annals is now gaining ground there are several among which i may class myself who are endeavoring to get into your regular and systematic course of cropping as fast as the nature of the business will admit so that i hope in the course of a few years we shall make a more respectable figure as farmers than we have hitherto done i will agreeable to your desire give you the prices of our products as nearly as i am able but you will readily conceive from the foregoing account that they cannot be given with any precision wheat for the four last years will average about  s sterling per bushel of eight gallons rye about  s  d—oats  s  d—beans pease c have not been sold in any quantities—barley is not made here from a prevailing opinion that the climate is not adapted to it i however in opposition to prejudice sowed about  0 bushels last spring and found that it yielded a proportionate quantity with any other kind of grain which i sowed i might add more cows may be bought at about  l sterling per head cattle for the slaughter vary from  ¼d to  ½d sterling per lb the former being the current price in summer the latter in the winter or spring sheep at   s sterling per head and wool at  s sterling per lb i am not able to give you the price of labor as the land is cultivated here wholly   0 by slaves and the price of labor in the towns is fluctuating and governed altogether by circumstances     george washington   november      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress mount vernon   november      my dear sir your favor of the   th ulto came duly to hand—as no subject is more interesting and seems so much to engross the attention of every one as the proposed constitution i shall though it is probable your communications from richmond are regular and full with respect to this and other matters which     employ the consideration of the assembly give you the extract of a letter from doct stuart which follows— yesterday the   th of oct according to appointment the calling of a convention of the people was discussed—though no one doubted a pretty general unanimity on this question ultimately yet it was feared from the avowed opposition of mr henry and mr harrison that an attempt would be made to do it in a manner that would convey to the people an unfavorable impression of the opinion of the house with respect to the constitution and this was accordingly attempted—it was however soon baffled—the motion was to this effect that a convention should be called to adopt—reject—or amend—the proposed constitution— as this conveyed an idea that the house conceived an amendment necessary it was rejected as improper—it now stands recommended to them on i think unexceptionable ground for their full and free consideration—my colleague arrived here on the evening before this question was taken up i am apt to think that the opponents to the constitution were much disappointed in their expectations of support from him as he not only declared himself in the fullest manner for a convention but also that notwithstanding his objections so federal was he that he would adopt it if nothing better could be obtained—the time at which the convention is to meet is fixed to the first of june next—the variety of sentiments on this subject was almost infinite neither friends or foes agreeing in any one period—there is to be no exclusion of persons on acct of their offices      notwithstanding this decision the accounts of the prevailing sentiments without especially on james river and westwardly are various—nothing decisive i believe can be drawn—as far as i can form an opinion however from different persons it should seem as if men judged of others by their own affection or disaffection to the proposed government—in the northern neck the sentiment i believe is very generally for it—i think it will be found such thro the state the doctor further adds the subject of british debts was taken up the other day when mr henry reflected in a very warm declamatory manner on the circular letter of congress on that subject—it is a great and important matter and i hope will be determined as it should be notwithstanding his opposition  so far as the sentiments of maryland with respect to the proposed constitution have come to my knowledge they are strongly in favor of it but as this is the day on which the assembly of that state ought to meet i will say nothing in anticipation of the opinion of it mr carroll of carrolton and mr thos johnson are declared friends to it with sincere regards and affect george washington  0 november      mount vernon bushrod washington to bushrod washington mount vernon  0 november      dear bushrod in due course of post your letters of the   th and   th ultimo came to hand and i thank you for the communications therein—for a continuation in matters     of importance i shall be obliged to you that the assembly would afford the people an opportunity of deciding on the proposed constitution i had scarcely a doubt the only question with me was whether it would go forth under favorable auspices or receive the stamp of disapprobation the opponents i expected for it ever has been that the adversaries to a measure are more active than its friends would endeavor to stamp it with unfavorable impressions in order to bias the judgment that is ultimately to decide on it this is evidently the case with the writers in opposition whose objections are better calculated to alarm the fears than to convince the judgment of their readers they build their objections upon principles that do not exist which the constitution does not support them in and the existence of which has been by an appeal to the constitution itself flatly denied and then as if they were unanswerable draw all the dreadful consequences that are necessary to alarm the apprehensions of the ignorant or unthinking it is not the interest of the major part of those characters to be convinced nor will their local views yield to arguments which do not accord with their present or future prospects a candid solution of a single question to which the plainest understanding is competent does in my opinion decide the dispute namely is it best for the states to unite or not to unite if there are men who prefer the latter then unquestionably the constitution which is offered must in their estimation be wrong from the words we the people to the signature     inclusively but those who think differently and yet object to parts of it would do well to consider that it does not lie with any one state or the minority of the states to superstruct a constitution for the whole the separate interests as far as it is practicable must be consolidated and local views must be attended to as far as the nature of the case will admit hence it is that every state has some objection to the present form and these objections are directed to different points that which is most pleasing to one is obnoxious to another and so vice versâ if then the union of the whole is a desirable object the component parts must yield a little in order to accomplish it without the latter the former is unattainable for again i repeat it that not a single state nor the minority of the states can force a constitution on the majority but admitting the power it will surely be granted that it cannot be done without involving scenes of civil commotion of a very serious nature let the opponents of the proposed constitution in this state be asked and it is a question they certainly ought to have asked themselves what line of conduct they would advise to adopt if nine other states of which i think there is little doubt should accede to the constitution would they recommend that it should stand single will they connect it with rhode island or even with two others checkerwise and remain with them as outcasts from the society to shift for themselves or will they return to their dependence on great britain or lastly     have the mortification to come in when they will be allowed no credit for doing so the warmest friends and the best supporters the constitution has do not contend that it is free from imperfections but they found them unavoidable and are sensible if evil is likely to arise therefrom the remedy must come hereafter for in the present moment it is not to be obtained and as there is a constitutional door open for it i think the people for it is with them to judge can as they will have the advantage of experience on their side decide with as much propriety on the alterations and amendments which are necessary as ourselves i do not think we are more inspired have more wisdom or possess more virtue than those who will come after us the power under the constitution will always be in the people it is intrusted for certain defined purposes and for a certain limited period to representatives of their own choosing and whenever it is executed contrary to their interest or not agreeable to their wishes their servants can and undoubtedly will be recalled it is agreed on all hands that no government can be well administered without powers yet the instant these are delegated although those who are intrusted with the administration are no more than the creatures of the people act as it were but for a day and are amenable for every false step they take they are from the moment they receive it set down as tyrants their natures they would conceive from this immediately changed and that they can have no other disposition but to oppress     of these things in a government constituted and guarded as ours is i have no idea and do firmly believe that whilst many ostensible reasons are assigned to prevent the adoption of it the real ones are concealed behind the curtains because they are not of a nature to appear in open day i believe further supposing them pure that as great evils result from too great jealousy as from the want of it we need look i think no further for proof of this than to the constitution of some if not all of these states no man is a warmer advocate for proper restraints and wholesome checks in every department of government than i am but i have never yet been able to discover the propriety of placing it absolutely out of the power of men to render essential services because a possibility remains of their doing ill if mr ronald can place the finances of this country upon so respectable a footing as he has intimated he will deserve much of its thanks in the attempt my best wishes i have nothing more to offer will accompany him i hope there remains virtue enough in the assembly of this state to preserve inviolate public treaties and private contracts if these are infringed farewell to respectability and safety in the government i have possessed a doubt but if any had existed in my breast reiterated proofs would have convinced me of the impolicy of all commutable taxes if we cannot learn wisdom from experience it is hard to say where it is to be found but why talk of learning     it these things are mere jobs by which few are enriched at the public expense for whether premeditation or ignorance is the cause of this destructive scheme it ends in oppression you have i find broke the ice the only advice i will offer to you on the occasion if you have a mind to command the attention of the house is to speak seldom but to important subjects except such as particularly relate to your constituents and in the former case make yourself perfectly master of the subject never exceed a decent warmth and submit your sentiments with diffidence a dictatorial stile though it may carry conviction is always accompanied with disgust i am c george washington    november      mount vernon thomas johnson to thomas johnson mount vernon    november      sir the lettter with which you have been pleased to honor me dated the   th inst came to my hand the day before yesterday by tomorrows post this answer will be forwarded to you mr rumsey has given you an uncandid account of his explanation to me of the principle on which his boat was to be propelled against stream at the time he exhibited his model and obtained certificate i have no reason to believe that the use of steam was contemplated by him sure i am it was not mentioned and equally certain i am that it would not apply to the project he then had in view the first communication of which was made to me in september          at the springs in berkley the novr following being in richmond i met mr rumsey there who was at that time applying to the assembly for a exclusive act he then spoke of the effect of steam and the conviction he was under of the usefulness of its application for inland navigation but i did not then conceive nor have i done so at any moment since that it was suggested as a part of his original plan but rather as the ebullition of his genius it is proper however for me to add that some time after this mr fitch called upon me on his way to richmond and explaining his scheme wanted a letter from me introductory of it to the assembly of this state the giving of which i declined and went on to inform him that tho i was bound not to disclose the principles of mr rumseys discovery i could venture to assure him that the thought of applying steam for the purpose he mentioned was not original but had been mentioned to me by mr rumsey—this i thought myself obliged to say that whichever if either of them was the discoverer might derive the benefit of the invention to the best of my recollection of what passed between mr rumsey and me the foregoing is an impartial recital    george washington  0 november      mount vernon david stuart to david stuart mount vernon  0 november      dear sir your favor of the   th came duly to hand i am sorry to find by it that the opposition gains strength i do not wonder much at this the adversaries to a     measure are generally if not always more violent and active than the advocates and frequently employ means which the others do not to accomplish their ends i have seen no publication yet that ought in my judgment to shake the proposed constitution in the mind of an impartial and candid public in fine i have hardly seen one that is not addressed to the passions of the people and obviously calculated to alarm their fears every attempt to amend the constitution at this time is in my opinion idle and vain if there are characters who prefer disunion or separate confederacies to the general government which is offered to them their opposition may for aught i know proceed from principle but as nothing according to my conception of the matter is more to be deprecated than a disunion or these distinct confederacies as far as my voice can go it shall be offered in favor of the latter that there are some writers and others perhaps who may not have written that wish to see this union divided into several confederacies is pretty evident as an antidote to these opinions and in order to investigate the ground of objections to the constitution which is submitted the federalist under the signature of publius is written the numbers which have been published i send you if there is a printer in richmond who is really well disposed to support the new constitution he would do well to give them a place in his paper they are i think i may venture to say written by able men and before they are finished will or i am mistaken place matters in a true   0 point of light although i am acquainted with the writers who have a hand in this work i am not at liberty to mention names nor would i have it known that they are sent by me to you for promulgation  you will recollect that the business of the potomac company is withheld from the assembly of maryland until it is acted upon in this state that the sitting of that assembly is expected to be short and that our operations may be suspended if there is no other recourse to be had than to common law process to obtain the dividends which are called for by the directors and not paid by the subscribers certificate and commutable taxes i hope will be done away  and that the assembly will not interfere     either with public treaties or private contracts bad indeed must the situation of that country be when this is the case with great pleasure i received the information respecting the commencement of my nephews political course i hope he will not be so buoyed by the favorable impression it has made as to become a babbler if the convention was such a tumultuous and disorderly body as a certain gentleman has represented it was due in a great measure to a few dissatisfied characters who would not submit to the decisions of a majority thereof    i am dear sir your most obedient c george washington   december      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress mount vernon   december      my dear sir since my last to you i have been favored with your letters of the   th of october and   th of november with the last came seven numbers of the federalist under the signature of publius for which i thank you they are forwarded to a gentleman in richmond for republication the doing of which in this state will i am persuaded have a good effect as there are certainly characters who are no friends to a general government perhaps i should not go too far was i to add who have no great objection to the introduction of anarchy and confusion the solicitude to discover what the several state legislatures would do with the constitution is now     transferred to the several conventions the decisions of which being more interesting and conclusive is consequently more anxiously expected than the other what pennsylvania and delaware have done or will do must soon be known other conventions to the northward and eastward of them are treading closely on their heels but what the three southern states have done or in what light the new constitution is viewed by them i have not been able to learn north carolina it has been said by some accounts from richmond will be governed in a great measure by the conduct of virginia the pride of south carolina will not i conceive suffer this influence to work in her councils and the disturbances in georgia will or i am mistaken show the people of it the propriety of being united and the necessity there is for a general government if these with the states eastward and northward of us should accede to the federal government i think the citizens of this state will have no cause to bless the opposers of it here if they should carry their point a paragraph in the baltimore paper has announced a change in the sentiments of mr jay on this subject and adds that from being an admirer of the new form he has become a bitter enemy to it this relation without knowing mr jays opinion i discredit from a conviction that he would consider the matter well before he would pass any judgment and having done so would not change his opinion almost in the same breath—i am anxious however to know on what ground this report originates especially the indelicacy of the expression it     is very unlikely therefore that a man of his knowledge and foresight should turn on both sides of a question in so short a space  it would have given me great pleasure to have complied with your request in behalf of your foreign acquaintance at present i am unable to do it the survey of the county between the eastern and western waters is not yet reported by the commissioners—tho promised to be made very shortly—the survey being completed no draught that can convey an adequate idea of the work on this river has been yet taken much of the labor except at the great falls has been bestowed in the bed of the river in a removal of the rocks and deepening the water at the great falls—the labor has indeed been great the water there a sufficiency i mean is taken into a canal about  00 yards above the cataract and conveyed by a level cut thro a solid rock in some places and much stone everywhere more than a mile to the lock seats five in number by means of which when completed the craft will be let into the river below the falls which together amount to    feet at the seneca falls six miles above the great falls a channel which has been formed by the river when inundated is under improvement for the navigation the same in part at shannondoah—at the lower falls where     nothing has yet been done a level cut and locks are proposed these constitute the principal difficulties and will be the great expense of this undertaking—the parts of the river between requiring loose stones only to be removed in order to deepen the water where it is too shallow in dry season p s since writing the foregoing i have received a letter from a member of the assembly in richmond dated the  th instant giving the following information— i am sorry to inform you that the constitution has lost ground so considerably that it is doubted whether it has any longer a majority in its favor from a vote which took place the other day this would appear certain though i cannot think it so decisive as the enemies to it consider it it marks however the inconsistency of some of its opponents at the time the resolutions calling a convention were entered into colonel m sided with the friends to the constitution and opposed any hint being given expressive of the sentiments of the house as to amendments but as it was unfortunately omitted at that time to make provision for the subsistence of the convention it became necessary to pass some resolution providing for any expense which may attend an attempt to make amendments as m had on the former occasion declared that it would be improper to make any discovery of the sentiments of the house on the subject and that we had no right to suggest any thing to a body paramount to us his advocating such a resolution was matter of astonishment it is true he declared it was not declaratory of our opinion but the contrary must be very obvious as i have heard many declare themselves friends to the constitution since the vote i do not consider it as altogether decisive of the opinion of the house with respect to it i am informed both by general wilkinson who is just arrived here from new orleans by way of north carolina and mr ross that north carolina is almost unanimous for adopting it     the latter received a letter from a member of that assembly now sitting in a debating society here which meets once a week this subject has been canvassed at two successive meetings and is to be finally decided on tomorrow evening as the whole assembly almost has attended on these occasions their opinion will then be pretty well ascertained and as the opinion on this occasion will have much influence some of colonel inniss friends have obtained a promise from him to enter the lists the bill respecting british debts has passed our house but with such a clause as i think makes it worse than a rejection the letter of which i enclose you a printed copy from colonel r h lee to the governor has been circulated with great industry in manuscript four weeks before it went to press and is said to have had a bad influence  the enemies to the constitution leave no stone unturned to increase the opposition to it i am c george washington    december      mount vernon thomas lewis to colonel thomas lewis mount vernon    december      sir it is my desire and i am told that it is the wish of many—and sure i am policy requires it—that the uncultivated tracts of land on the great kanhawa and ohio belonging to the military should be settled the difficulty with me respecting mine has been how to draw the line of mutual advantage for landlord and tenant with respect to the terms and where to find     a confidential person on or near the spot who would act for me as agent two reasons hitherto have restrained me from making application to you on this head—first the uncertainty i was under of your having become an actual resident in those parts—and second a doubt whether it might be agreeable to you to accept this trust on account of the trouble and little profit that would derive from the agency at least for some time the first cause being removed having understood by means of some members in assembly that you live at point pleasant i shall take the liberty of trying you on the second under a hope that more from the desire of seeing the country settled the neighborhood strengthened and property thereby secured and the value of it increased than from any pecuniary considerations at the present moment you may be induced to aid me in seating my lands on the great kanhawa and on the ohio between the mouths of the two rivers bearing that name if you accept the trust this letter shall be your authority—fully—and amply given and binding upon me and my heirs for the following purposes— first to place as many tenants on the several tracts of lands plats of which with my signature annexed to them shall accompany this power as you can obtain consistently with your judgment and suggestions hereafter mentioned second that an exemption from the payment of rents for the term of three years shall be allowed them provided certain reasonable improvements such     as you shall stipulate for—and which i think but leave the matter to you ought to be comfortable houses—acres of arable—and—acres of meadow land and a certain number of frute trees planted third that for the fourth year rents shall become due and shall consist as i am told the custom of the country is of a third of whatever is raised on the premises which rents shall be annually paid thereafter to you or my agent for the time being in that country— fourth that under this tenure they may be assured of the places if they incline to remain and will go on to improve them for the term of—years were these not to exceed ten it would be more pleasing to me than any extension beyond that number but if this limitation will not be acceded to on the part of the tenant i must leave it to your discretion to augment them making the term definite and not for lives which is not only uncertain but often introductory of disputes to ascertain the termination of them—instances of which have happened to me all mines and minerals will be reserved for the landlord—and where there are valuable streams for water works the rents must bear some proportion to the advantages which are likely to result from them— fifth whether custom authorizes or justice requires that the tenant should pay the land tax of what he agrees to hold before the rent becomes due or afterwards in whole or part must be governed by the practice which prevails and consequently is left to your decision     sixth i do not conceive it necessary nor should i incline to go into much or indeed any expense in laying the land off into lots till it begins to be thick settled and productive the first comers will of course have the first choice—but they and all others are to be informed that their lotts be the quantity little or much will be bounded by water courses or where this is not the case by convenient and regular forms—and as most of my tracts as you will see by the plats have extensive boundaries on the rivers running but a little ways back it is my wish indeed it naturally follows that back part of the land should be considered as the support of that which will be first settled and cleared on the margins of the rivers and a sufficiency of it reserved for that purpose seventh for your trouble in negotiating this business i am very willing to allow the usual commission for collecting—converting into cash and transmitting to me the rents after they shall commence and whatever you may think proper to charge me in reason for your trouble till this shall happen—i will cheerfully agree to pay whether you accept this trust or not you will do me a favor in the communication of your sentiments on the subject there are two ways by which letters will come safe—viz—thrown into the post office at philadelphia or into that at richmond—colo bayard an acquaintance of mine or any acquaintance you may have at fort pitt will forward them to the first place—and the means of doing it to the latter     you must be a better judge of than myself—if the letters once get into the post office i shall be sure of them—on private conveyances there is no reliance—they are tossed about and neglected so as rarely to reach their intended destination when sent in this manner if you should incline to act under this power your own good sense and judgment will at once dictate the propriety indeed necessity of promulgating it as extensively as you can by advertisements to those parts from whence settlers are most likely to be drawn over and above the opportunities which your situation gives you of communicating the matter to travellers by water on the ohio on the other hand if you do not incline to act i would thank you for returning me the papers herewith enclosed as it will save me the trouble of making other copies whether the improvements which i had made on the lands of which you have herewith the draughts in the years      and   will be of use to settlers at this day or not you who are on the spot can best determine—they cost me or were valued to between £  00 and  000—if they are useful the exemption from rent should be shorter—i thought it necessary to bring the matter into view tho my expectations from it are small i am c— p s i have a small tract called the round bottom containing abt  00 acres which i would also let—it lyes on the ohio opposite to pipe creek and a little above capteening  00      george washington   january      mount vernon thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson mount vernon   january      dear sir i have received your favor of the   th of august and am sorry that it is not in my power to give any further information relative to the practicability of opening a communication between lake erie and the ohio than you are already possessed of i have made frequent inquiries since the time of your writing at annapolis but could never collect any thing that was decided or satisfactory i have again renewed them and flatter myself with better prospects the accounts generally agree as to its being a flat country between the waters of lake erie and big beaver but differ very much with respect to the distance between their sources their navigation and the inconveniences which would attend the cutting a canal between them from the best information i have been able to obtain of that country the sources of the muskingum and cayahoga approach nearer to each other than big beaver but a communication through the muskingum would be more circuitous and difficult having the ohio in a greater extent to ascend unless the latter could be avoided by opening a communication between james river and the great kanhawa or between the little kanhawa and the west branch of the monongahela which is said to be very practicable by a short portage as a testimony thereof a road is now opened or opening under the authority and at the expense of the states of virginia and maryland from the north branch of  0  potomac commencing at the mouth of savage river to cheat river and continued from thence to the navigable water of the little kanhawa at the cost of the former the distance between lake erie and the ohio through the big beaver is however so much less than the route through the muskingum that it would in my opinion operate very strongly in favor of opening a canal between the sources of the nearest water of the lake and big beaver although the distance between them should be much greater and the operation more difficult than to the muskingum as it is the direct line to the nearest shipping port on the atlantic i shall omit no opportunity of gaining every information relative to this important subject and with pleasure communicate to you whatever may be worthy of your attention  i did myself the honor to forward to you the plan of government formed by the convention as soon as that body rose but was not a little disappointed and mortified indeed as i wished to make the first offering of it to you to find by a letter dated the  th of november in new york from commodore jones that it was at that time in his possession you have undoubtedly received it or some other ere now and formed an opinion upon it the public attention is at present wholly engrossed by this important subject the legislatures of those states rhode island excepted which have met since the  0  constitution has been formed have readily assented to its being submitted to a convention chosen by the people pennsylvania new jersey and delaware are the only states whose conventions have as yet decided upon it in the former it was adopted by fortysix to twentythree and in the two latter unanimously connecticut and massachusetts are to hold their conventions on the first and second tuesdays of this month maryland in april virginia in june and upon the whole it appears so far as i have had an opportunity of learning the opinions of the people in the several states that it will be received there will undoubtedly be more or less opposition to its being adopted in most of the states and in none a more formidable one than in this as many influential characters here have taken a decided part against it among whom are mr henry colonel mason governor randolph and mr richard henry lee but from every information which i have been able to obtain i think there will be a majority in its favor notwithstanding their dissention in new york a considerable opposition will also be given i am much obliged to you my dear sir for the account which you gave me of the general state of affairs in europe i am glad to hear that the assemblée des notables has been productive of good in france the abuse of the finances being disclosed to the king and the nation must open their eyes and lead to the adoption of such measures as will prove beneficial to them in future from the  0  public papers it appears that the parliaments of the several provinces and particularly that of paris have acted with great spirit and resolution indeed the rights of mankind the privileges of the people and the true principles of liberty seem to have been more generally discussed and better understood throughout europe since the american revolution than they were at any former period although the finances of france and england were such as led you to suppose at the time you wrote to me yet if we credit the concurrent accounts from every quarter there is little doubt but that they have commenced hostilities before this russia and the porte have formally begun the contest and from appearances as given to us it is not improbable but that a general war will be kindled in europe should this be the case we shall feel more than ever the want of an efficient general government to regulate our commercial concerns to give us a national respectability and to connect the political views and interests of the several states under one head in such a manner as will effectually prevent them from forming separate improper or indeed any connexion with the european powers which can involve them in their political disputes  for our situation is such as makes it not only unnecessary but extremely imprudent  0  for us to take a part in their quarrels and whenever a contest happens among them if we wisely and properly improve the advantages which nature has given us we may be benefited by their folly provided we conduct ourselves with circumspection and under proper restrictions for i perfectly agree with you that an extensive speculation a spirit of gambling or the introduction of any thing which will divert our attention from agriculture must be extremely prejudicial if not ruinous to us but i conceive under an energetic general government such regulations might be made and such measures taken as would render this country the asylum of pacific and industrious characters from all parts of europe would encourage the cultivation of the earth by the high price which its products would command and would draw the wealth and wealthy men of other nations into our bosom by giving security to property and liberty to its holders i have the honor to be c george washington   january      mount vernon edmund randolph to edmund randolph governor of virginia mount vernon   january      dear sir the letter which you did me the honor of writing to me on the   th ultimo with the enclosure  came duly to hand i receive them as a fresh instance of your friendship and attention for both i thank you  0  the diversity of sentiments upon the important matter which has been submitted to the people was as much expected as it is regretted by me the various passions and motives by which men are influenced are concomitants of fallibility engrafted into our nature for the purposes of unerring wisdom but had i entertained a latent hope at the time you moved to have the constitution submitted to a second convention that a more perfect form would be agreed to in a word that any constitution would be adopted under the impressions and instructions of the members the publications which have taken place since would have eradicated every form of it how do the sentiments of the influential characters in this state who are opposed to the constitution and have favored the public with their opinions quadrate with each other are they not at variance on some of the most important points if the opponents in the same state cannot agree in their principles what prospect is there of a coalescence with the advocates of the measure when the different views and jarring interests of so wide and extended an empire are to be brought forward and combated to my judgment it is more clear than ever that an attempt to amend the constitution which is submitted would be productive of more heat and greater confusion than can well be conceived there are some things in the new form i will readily acknowledge which never did and i am persuaded never will obtain my cordial approbation but i then did conceive and do now most firmly believe that in the aggregate it is  0  the best constitution that can be obtained at this epoch and that this or a dissolution of the union awaits our choice and are the only alternatives before us thus believing i had not nor have i now any hesitation in deciding on which to lean i pray your forgiveness for the expression of these sentiments in acknowledging the receipt of your letter on this subject it was hardly to be avoided although i am welldisposed to let the matter rest entirely on its own merits and mens minds to their own workings with very great esteem and regard i am c george washington  0 january      mount vernon frederick weissenfels to colonel frederick weissenfels mount vernon  0 january      sir i have received your letter of the  0th of december in answer to that as well as those which you wrote to me in june last i am sorry to inform you that i cannot with any propriety make application to congress had it the offices to bestow or any other publick body in your behalf for an appointment because it would be acting directly contrary to a resolution which i made when i quitted the publick service not to make application for or interfere with appointments of any kind it is a matter of regret as well as surprize that you should apply to me in an affair of this nature in preference to those persons among whom you live and have been more immediately employd and who must from their long acquaintance with you have a much  0  better knowledge of your merits and sufferings than i can be supposed to have if you expect relief from the cincinnati it is to the state society you must look for it or apply to the generalmeeting when convened for i cannot as an individual transact any business of this kind relating to the society i am c george washington  0 january      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress mount vernon  0 january      my dear sir i stand indebted to you for your favors of the  0th and   th ultimo and i believe for that of the   th also and their enclosures it does not appear to me that there is any certain criterion in this state by which a decided judgment can be formed as to the opinion entertained by its citizens with respect to the new constitution my belief on this occasion is that whenever the matter is brought to a final decision not only a majority but a large one will be found in its favor that the opposition should have gained strength at richmond among the members of assembly is not if true to be wondered at when we consider that the great adversaries to the constitution are all assembled at that place acting conjointly with the promulgated sentiments of colonel richard henry lee as auxiliary it is said however and i believe it may be depended upon that the latter though he may retain his sentiments has withdrawn or means to withdraw his opposition because as he has expressed himself or as others have done  0  it for him he finds himself in bad company such as with mercer smith c c his brother francis l lee on whose judgment the family place much reliance is decidedly in favor of the new form under a conviction that it is the best that can be obtained and because it promises energy stability and that security which is or ought to be the wish of every good citizen of the union how far the determination of the question before the debating club mentioned to you in a former letter may be considered as auspicious of the final decision of the convention in this state i will not prognosticate but in this club the question it seems was determined by a very large majority in favor of the constitution but of all arguments that may be used at the convention which is to be held for it the most prevailing one i expect will be that nine states at least will have acceded to it and if the unanimity or majorities in those which follow are equal to those which are passed the force of them will prove irresistible the governor has given his reasons to the public for withholding his signature a copy of them i send you our assembly has been long in session employed chiefly as far as i can understand in rectifying some of the mistakes of the last and committing new ones for emendations at the next yet who so wise as we are we are held in painful suspense in regard to european matters war or peace seems yet undecided although the first is loudly talked of i have no regular correspondent in massachusetts  0  otherwise as an occasional matter i should have had no objection to the communication of my sentiments to him as they are unequivocal and decided i am c p s i have this moment been informed that the assembly of north carolina have postponed the meeting of the convention of that state until july this seems to be calculated evidently for the purpose of taking the tone from virginia  george washington    january      mount vernon charles carter to charles carter mount vernon    january      dear sir i find that an extract from my letter to you is running through all the newspapers and published in that of baltimore with the addition of my name although i have no disinclination to the promulgation of my sentiments on the proposed constitution not having concealed them on any occasion yet i must nevertheless confess that it gives me pain to see the hasty and indigested production of a   0 private letter handed to the public to be animadverted upon by the adversaries of the new government could i have supposed that the contents of a private letter marked with evident haste would have composed a newspaper paragraph i certainly should have taken some pains to dress the sentiments to whom known is indifferent to me in less exceptionable language and would have assigned some reasons in support of my opinion and the charges against others i am persuaded your intentions were good but i am not less persuaded that you have provided food for strictures and criticisms be this however as it may it shall pass off unnoticed by me as i have no inclination and still less abilities for scribbling with very great esteem and regard i am c      george washington   february      mount vernon jonathan trumbull to jonathan trumbull mount vernon   february      my dear sir i thank you for your obliging favor of the  th ulto which came duly to hand and congratulate with you on the adoption of the new constitution in your state by so decided a majority and so many respectable characters i wish for the same good tidings from massachusetts but the accounts from thence are not so favorable—the decision it is even said is problematical arising as i believe   0ths of the opposition does from local circumstance and sinister views the result of the deliberations in that state will have considerable influence on those     which are to follow—especially in that of new york where i fancy the opposition to the form will be greatest  altho an inhabitant of this state i cannot speak with decision on the publick sentiment of it with respect to the proposed constitution—my private opinion however of the matter is that it will certainly be received but in this opinion i may be mistaken—i have not been ten miles from home since my return to it from philadelphia—i see few who do not live within that circle except travellers and strangers and these form opinions upon too slight ground to be relied on the opponents of the constitution are indefatigable in fabricating and circulating papers reports c to its prejudice whilst the friends generally content themselves with the goodness of the cause and the necessity for its adoption supposing it wants no other support mrs washington and others of this family with whom you are acquainted among which is colo humphries join me in every good wish for you mrs trumbull and family and with sentiments of the sincerest regard and friendship i am c     george washington   february      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress mount vernon   february      my dear sir i am indebted to you for several of your favors and thank you for their enclosure the rumor of war between france and england has subsided and the poor patriots of holland it seems are left to fight their own battles or negotiate in either case with no great prospect of advantage they must have been much deceived or their conduct has been weak and precipitate and absurd the former however i believe is the truth i am sorry to find by yours and other accounts from massachusetts that the decision of its convention at the time of their respective dates remained problematical  a rejection of the new form by that state would invigorate the opposition not only in     new york but in all those which are to follow at the same time this would afford materials for the minority in such as have actually agreed to it to blow the trumpet of discord more loudly the acceptance by a bare majority though preferable to a rejection is also to be deprecated it is scarcely possible to form any decided opinion of the general sentiment of the people of this state on this point many have asked me with anxious solicitude if you did not mean to get into the convention conceiving it of indispensable necessity colonel mason who returned but yesterday i am told has offered himself for stafford county and his friends say he can be elected not only in that but in the counties of prince william and fauquier also the truth of this i know not i rarely go from home and my visitors who for the most part are travellers and strangers have not the best means of information at the time you suggested for my consideration the expediency of a communication of my sentiments to any correspondent i might have in massachusetts on the proposed constitution i did not recollect that general lincoln and myself frequently interchanged letters much less did i expect that a hasty and indigested extract from a letter of which i had written intermingled with a variety of other matters to colonel charles carter in answer to a letter i had received from him on the subject of some experiments we had made in farming wolves wolfdogs sheep and the lord knows what else was then in the press and would bring them to public view by means of the general circulation i find that extract has had     although i never have concealed and am perfectly regardless who becomes acquainted with my sentiments with respect to the proposed constitution yet nevertheless as no pains have been taken to dress the ideas nor any reasons assigned in support of opinion i feel myself hurt by the publication and informed my friend the colo thereof in answer he has fully acquitted himself of the intention but his zeal in the cause prompted him to distribute copies under a prohibition which was disregarded that it should not go to the press as you have seen the crude or rude extract as you may please to term it i will add no more on the subject perceiving that the federalist under the signature of publius is about to be republished i would thank you for forwarding to me three or four copies one of which to be bound and inform me of the cost although we have not had many or deep snows yet we have since the commencement of it had a very severe winter and if this day with you is as much keener than we now feel it as the difference of latitude ought to make it you will feel a comfortable fire no bad antidote against cold fingers and toes i am c george washington   february      mount vernon chevalier de la luzerne to the chevalier de la luzerne mount vernon   february      sir the count de moustier your successor in office hath forwarded from new york the letter in which you did me the honor to bring me acquainted with the merits of that nobleman since it is the misfortune     of america not to be favored any longer with your residence it was necessary to diminish our regrets that so worthy and respectable a character should be appointed your successor i shall certainly be happy in cultivating his acquaintance and friendship the citizens from gratitude as well as from personal considerations will i am persuaded treat him with the greatest respect congress i doubt not will by every means in their power desire to make his sojourn in the united states as agreeable as it possibly can be but sir you may rest assured that your abilities and dispositions to serve this country were so well understood and your services so properly appreciated that the residence of no public minister will ever be longer remembered or his absence more sincerely regretted it will not be forgotten that you were a witness to the dangers the sufferings the exertions and the successes of the united states from the most perilous crises to the hour of triumph the influence of your agency on the cabinet to produce a coöperation and the prowess of your countrymen coöperating with ours in the field to secure the liberties of america have made such an indelible impression on the public mind as will never be effaced wherever you may be our best wishes will follow you and such is our confidence in your disinterested friendship that we are certain you will wish to be useful to us in whatever mission you may be honored by your king it has been surmised on i know not what authority that there was a probability of your being employed in the diplomatic corps at the court of london     should this be the case your zeal may still find occasions of being serviceable to america and profitable to your own country at the same time for i conceive the commercial interests of the two nations are in many instances blended and in opposition to those of great britain    i feel sir not only for myself but in behalf of my country under great obligations for the affectionate wishes you have the goodness to make with respect to the tranquillity and happiness of america separated as we are by a world of water from other nations if we are wise we shall surely avoid being drawn into the labyrinth of their politics and involved in their destructive wars    george washington   february      mount vernon marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette mount vernon   february      my dear marquis you know it always gives me the sincerest pleasure to hear from you and therefore i need only say that your two kind letters of the  th and   th of october so replete with personal affection and confidential intelligence afforded me inexpressible satisfaction i shall myself be happy in forming an acquaintance and cultivating a friendship with the new minister plenipotentiary of france whom you have commended as a sensible and honest man these are qualities too rare and too precious not to merit ones particular esteem you may be persuaded that he will be well     received by the congress of the united states because they will not only be influenced in their conduct by his individual merits but also by their affection for the nation of whose sovereign he is the representative for it is an undoubted fact that the people of america entertain a grateful remembrance of past services as well as a favorable disposition for commercial and friendly connexions with your nation  you appear to be as might be expected from a real friend to this country anxiously concerned about its present political situation so far as i am able i shall be happy in gratifying that friendly solicitude as to my sentiments with respect to the merits of the new constitution i will disclose them without reserve although by passing through the postoffice they should become known to all the world for in truth i have nothing to conceal on that subject it appears to me then little short of a miracle that the delegates from so many different states which states you know are also different from each other in their manners circumstances and prejudices should unite in forming a system of national     government so little liable to wellfounded objections nor am i yet such an enthusiastic partial or undiscriminating admirer of it as not to perceive it is tinctured with some real though not radical defects the limits of a letter would not suffer me to go fully into an examination of them nor would the discussion be entertaining or profitable i therefore forbear to touch upon it with regard to the two great points the pivots upon which the whole machine must move my creed is simply  st that the general government is not invested with more powers than are indispensably necessary to perform the functions of a good government and consequently that no objection ought to be made against the quantity of power delegated to it  ly that these powers as the appointment of all rulers will for ever arise from and at short stated intervals recur to the free suffrage of the people are so distributed among the legislative executive and judicial branches into which the general government is arranged that it can never be in danger of degenerating into a monarchy an oligarchy an aristocracy or any other despotic or oppressive form so long as there shall remain any virtue in the body of the people i would not be understood my dear marquis to speak of consequences which may be produced in the revolution of ages by corruption of morals profligacy of manners and listlessness for the preservation of the natural and unalienable rights of mankind nor of the successful usurpations that may   0 be established at such an unpropitious juncture upon the ruins of liberty however providently guarded and secured as these are contingencies against which no human prudence can effectually provide it will at least be a recommendation to the proposed constitution that it is provided with more checks and barriers against the introduction of tyranny and those of a nature less liable to be surmounted than any government hitherto instituted among mortals hath possessed we are not to expect perfection in this world but mankind in modern times have apparently made some progress in the science of government should that which is now offered to the people of america be found on experiment less perfect than it can be made a constitutional door is left open for its amelioration some respectable characters have wished that the states after having pointed out whatever alterations and amendments may be judged necessary would appoint another federal convention to modify it upon those documents for myself i have wondered that sensible men should not see the impracticability of this scheme the members would go fortified with such instructions that nothing but discordant ideas could prevail had i but slightly suspected at the time when the late convention was in session that another convention would not be likely to agree upon a better form of government i should now be confirmed in the fixed belief that they would not be able to agree upon any system whatever so many i may add such contradictory and in my     opinion unfounded objections have been urged against the system in contemplation many of which would operate equally against every efficient government that might be proposed i will only add as a further opinion founded on the maturest deliberation that there is no alternative no hope of alteration no intermediate restingplace between the adoption of this and a recurrence to an unqualified state of anarchy with all its deplorable consequences since i had the pleasure of writing to you last no material alteration in the political state of affairs has taken place to change the prospect of the constitutions being adopted by nine states or more pennsylvania delaware new jersey and connecticut have already done it it is also said georgia has acceded massachusetts which is perhaps thought to be rather more doubtful that when i last addressed you is now in convention a spirit of emigration to the western country is very predominant congress have sold in the year past a pretty large quantity of land on the ohio for public securities and thereby diminished the domestic debt considerably many of your military acquaintances such as the generals parsons varnum and putnam the colonels tupper sprout and sherman with many more propose settling there from such beginnings much may be expected the storm of war between england and your nation it seems is dissipated i hope and trust the political affairs in france are taking a favorable turn if the turks will suffer themselves to     be precipitated into a war they must abide the consequences some politicians speculate on a triple alliance between the two imperial courts and versailles it gives me great pleasure to learn that the present ministry of france are friendly to america and that mr jefferson and yourself have a prospect of accomplishing measures which will mutually benefit and improve the commercial intercourse between the two nations every good wish attend you and yours i am c george washington    february      mount vernon alexander spotswood to alexander spotswood mount vernon    february      dear sir       i think with you that the life of a husbandman of all others is the most delectable it is honorable it is amusing and with judicious management it is profitable to see plants rise from the earth and flourish by the superior skill and bounty of the laborer fills a contemplative mind with ideas which are more easy to be conceived than expressed i am glad to find that your first essay to raise indian corn in drills has succeeded so much to your satisfaction but i am inclined to think unless restoratives were more abundant than they are to be found on common farms that six feet by two will be too oppressive to your land experience has proved that every soil will sink under the growth of this plant whether from the luxuriancy and exhausting     quality of it or the manner of tillage or from both is not very certain because instead of two thousand four hundred and twenty plants which stand on an acre at six feet square with two stalks in a hill as is usual in land of middling quality you have three thousand six hundred and thirty at six feet by two single stalks how far the exposing of land to the rays of the sun in summer is injurious is a question yet more difficult to solve than the other my own opinion of the matter is that it does but this controverts the practice of summer fallows which especially in heavy land some of the best practical farmers in england contend for as indispensably necessary notwithstanding the doctrine of mr young and many others who are opposed to them the reason however which induced me to give my cornrows the wide distance of ten feet was not because i thought it essential to the growth of that plant but because i introduced other plants between them and this practice from the experience of two years one the wettest and the other the driest that ever was felt on my estate i am resolved to continue until the inutility of it or something more advantageous shall point out the expediency of a change but i mean to practise it with variations fixing on eight by two feet as the medium or standing distance which will give more plants by three hundred to the acre than six feet each way with two stalks in a hill will do as all my corn will be thus drilled so between all i mean to put in drills also potatoes carrots as far as     my seed will go and turnips alternately that not one sort more than another may have the advantage of soil thereby to ascertain the comparative quantity and value of each of these plants as food for horses and stock of every kind from the trials i have made under the disadvantages already mentioned i am well satisfied that my crop of corn in this way will equal the yield of the same fields in the usual mode of cultivation and that the quantity of potatoes proportionate to the number of rows will quadruple the corn i entertain the same opinion with respect to carrots but being more unlucky in the latter i cannot speak with so much confidence and still less can i do it with respect to turnips from this husbandry and statement of what i conceive to be facts any given number of acres will yield as much corn in the new as they will in the old way and will moreover with little or no extra labor produce four times as many potatoes or carrots which adds considerably to the profit from the field but here it may be asked if the land will sustain these crops or rather the potatoes in addition to the corn this is a question my own experience does not enable me to answer the received opinion of many practical farmers in england is that potatoes and carrots are ameliorators not exhausters of the soil preparing it well for other crops but i do not scruple to confess that notwithstanding the profit which appears to result from the growth of corn and potatoes or corn and carrots or both thus blended my wish is to exclude indian corn altogether from my system of     cropping but we are so habituated to the use of this grain and it is so much better for negroes than any other that it is not to be discarded consequently to introduce it in the most profitable or least injurious manner ought to be the next consideration with the farmer to do this some are of opinion that a small spot set apart solely for the purpose and kept highly manured is the best method and an instance in proof is adduced of a gentleman near baltimore who for many years past from the same ground has not made less than ten barrels to the acre in drills six feet apart and if i recollect rightly eighteen inches in the rows but query where the farmer has no other resource than the manure of his own farm will not his other crops be starved by this extra allowance to the indian corn i am inclined to think it will and for that reason i shall try the intermixture of potatoes carrots and turnips or either as from practice shall be found most profitable with my corn which shall become a component part of some regular and systematic plan best adapted to the nature of my soil to societies which have been formed for the encouragement of agriculture is the perfection to which husbandry is now arrived in england indebted why then does not this country virginia i mean follow so laudable and beneficial an example and particularly why do not the gentlemen in the vicinity of fredericksburg begin this work your lands are peculiarly well adapted to it there are more of you in a small circle than i believe is to be found in the     same compass almost anywhere and you are well able to afford experiments from which and not from theory are individuals to derive useful knowledge and the public a benefit my love to which mrs washingtons is joined is presented to mrs spotswood and i am c george washington  0 february      mount vernon samuel griffin to samuel griffin mount vernon  0 february      sir i have been duly honored and greatly affected with the receipt of the resolution of the visitors and governors of william and mary college appointing me chancellor of the same and have to thank you for your polite attention in the transmission not knowing particularly what duties or whether any active services are immediately expected from the person holding the office of chancellor i have been greatly embarrassed in deciding upon the public answer proper to be given it is for that reason i have chosen to explain in this private communication my situation and feelings and to defer an ultimate decision until i shall have been favored with farther information on this subject my difficulties are briefly these on the one hand nothing in this world could be farther from my heart than a want of respect for the worthy gentlemen in question or a refusal of the appointment with which they have honored me provided its duties are not incompatible with the mode of life to which i have entirely addicted myself and on the other hand i would not for any consideration disappoint the just     expectations of the convocation by accepting an office whose functions i previously knew from my preëngagements and occupations i should be absolutely unable to perform although as i observed before i know not specifically what those functions are yet sir i have conceived that a principal duty required of the chancellor might be a regular and indispensable visitation once or perhaps twice a year should this be expected i must decline accepting the office for notwithstanding i most sincerely and ardently wish to afford whatever little influence i may possess in patronizing the cause of science i cannot at my time of life and in my actual state of retirement persuade myself to engage in new and extensive avocations such being the sentiments of a heart unaccustomed to disguise i flatter myself the candid manner in which i have explained them cannot be displeasing to the convocation and that the intervening delay between the present and the moment in which i shall have the pleasure of receiving such ulterior explanations as may enable me to give a definitive answer will not prove very detrimental to the collegiate interests i am c      george washington    february      mount vernon benjamin lincoln to benjamin lincoln mount vernon    february      my dear sir i have to acknowledge the receipt of your three letters of the  d  th and  th instant the information conveyed by the last was extremely pleasing to me though i cannot say it was altogether unexpected as the tenor of your former letters had in some measure prepared me for the event but the conduct of the minority was more satisfactory than could have been expected  the full and fair discussion which you gave the subject in your convention was attended     with the happiest consequences it afforded complete information to all those who went thither with dispositions to be informed and at the same time gave an opportunity to confute and point out the fallacy of those specious arguments which were offered in opposition to the proposed government nor is this all the conciliating behavior of the minority will strike a damp on the hopes which opponents in other states might otherwise have formed from the smallness of the majority and must be greatly influential in obtaining a favorable determination in those states which have not yet decided upon it    0 these is not perhaps a man in virginia less qualified than i am to say from his own knowledge and observation what will be the fate of the constitution here for i very seldom ride beyond the limits of my own farms and am wholly indebted to those gentlemen who visit me for any information of the disposition of the people towards it but from all i can collect i have not the smallest doubt of its being accepted i thank you my dear sir for the accounts which you have from time to time transmitted me since the meeting of your convention nothing could have been more grateful or acceptable to me i am also obliged by your promise to inform me of any important matters that may transpire and you know i shall at all times be happy to hear of your welfare mrs washington joins me in compliments to mrs lincoln and yourself i am dear sir c george washington   march      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress mount vernon   march      sir the decision of massachusetts notwithstanding its concomitants  is a severe stroke to the opponents of the proposed constitution in this state and with the favorable decision of those which have gone before it and such as are likely to follow after will have a     powerful operation on the minds of men who are not more influenced by passion pique and resentment than they are by candor moderation and judgment of the former description however i am sorry to say there are too many and among them some who would hazard every thing rather than fail in their opposition or have the sagacity of their prognostications impeached by the issue the determination you have come to will give much pleasure to your friends  from those in your county you will learn with more certainty than from me the expediency of your attending the election in it with some to have differed in sentiment is to have passed the rubicon of their friendship although you should go no further with others for the honor of humanity i hope there is more liberality but the consciousness of having discharged that duty which we owe to our country is superior to all other considerations and will put these out of the question his most christian majesty speaks and acts in a style not very pleasing to republican ears or to republican forms nor do i think it is altogether so to the temper of his own subjects at this day liberty when it begins to take root is a plant of rapid growth the checks he endeavors to give it however warranted by ancient usage will more than probably kindle a flame which may not be easily extinguished though it may be smothered for a while by the armies at his command and the nobility in his interest     when a people are oppressed with taxes and have a cause to believe that there has been a misapplication of the money they illy brook the language of despotism this and the mortification which the pride of the nation must have undergone with respect to the affairs of holland if it is fair to judge from appearances may be productive of events which prudence forbids one to mention tomorrow the elections for delegates to the state convention begin and as they will tread close upon the heels of each other it will make an interesting and important month with the most friendly sentiments and affectionate regard i am c  george washington    march      mount vernon samuel hanson to samuel hanson esq mount vernon    march      sir your letter of the   th inst was handed me yesterday in alexandria as i was going to dinner—previous     to that i had seen my nephew george washington and asked him if he had heard of any suitable place for himself and lawrence to board at after their quarter with mr mcwhir expired he told me that it was probable a place might be obtained at a mrs sandfords—i desired him to inform himself of the terms c and let me know them as i had not an opportunity of seeing him again before i left town to know the result of his enquiries it is not at this moment in my power to give a decided answer to your offer of taking them again into your family your candid and free communications respecting the conduct of my nephews while with you meet my warmest approbation and deserve my best thanks and i should think myself inexcusable if upon this occasion i did not act a part equally open and candid by informing you of general allegations which they have from time to time offered on their part viz they having been frequently detained from school in the morning beyond their proper hour in consequence of not having their breakfast seasonably provided and sometimes obliged to go to school without any—they have likewise complained of their not being permitted to dine with company at the house and served indifferently in another place afterwards and after being a short time with mr mcwhir they made application for shirts and upon being asked what they had done with those which were made for them not long before they replied that the manner of washing them at mr hansons in lye without soap had entirely destroyed them     this communication sir cannot i think be displeasing to a person of your candor—i do not state the above as facts but merely as the reports of the boys and if they should live with you again it will undoubtedly have a good effect by shewing them that their reports will always be made known to you and the truth or falsehood of them discovered the motive which first induced me to put the boys with you explained upon a former occasion together with the advantage of throwing them into company will still operate and incline me to give a preference to your house upon terms nearly equal in other respects but i cannot decide upon the matter till i know the result of georges enquiries and so soon as i do you may depend upon hearing further from sir c george washington    march      mount vernon count de moustier to the count de moustier mount vernon    march      sir i have received the letter which your excellency did me the honor of addressing to me by the hand of mr madison while i am highly gratified with the justice you do me in appreciating the friendly sentiments i entertain for the french nation i cannot avoid being equally astonished and mortified in learning that you have met with any subject of discontent or inquietude since your arrival in america  be assured sir as nothing could have been more unexpected     so nothing can now give me greater pleasure than to be instrumental in removing as far as may be in the power of a private citizen as i am every occasion of uneasiness that may have occurred i have even hoped from the short time of your residence here and the partial acquaintance you may have had with the characters of the persons that a natural distance in behavior and reserve in address may have appeared as intentional coldness and neglect i am sensible that the apology itself though it should be well founded would be but an indifferent one yet it will be better than none while it served to prove that it is our misfortune not to have the same cheerfulness in appearance and facility in deportment which some nations possess and this i believe in a certain degree to be the real fact and that such a reception is sometimes given by individuals as may affect a foreigner with very disagreeable sensations when not the least shadow of an affront is intended as i know the predilections of most of our leading characters for your nation as i had seen the clearest proofs of affection for your king given by the people of this country on the birth of the dauphin as i had heard before the receipt of your letter that you had been received at your public audience by congress with all the marks of attention which had ever been bestowed upon a representative of any sovereign power and as i found that your personal character stood in the fairest point of light i must confess i could not have conceived that there was one person in public office in the united states capable of having     treated with indifference much less with indignity the representative from a court with which we have ever been upon the most friendly terms and confident i am that it is only necessary for such conduct to be known to be detested but in the mean time so ardently do i wish to efface any ill impressions which may have been made upon your excellencys mind to the prejudice of the public by individuals that i must again repeat that i am egregiously deceived if the people of this country are not in general extremely well effected to france the prejudices against that kingdom had been so riveted by our english connexion and english policy that it was some time before our people could get entirely the better of them this however was thoroughly accomplished in the course of the war and i may venture to say that a greater revolution never took place in the sentiments of our people respecting another now as none of their former attachments have been revived for britain and as no subject of uneasiness has turned up with respect to france any disgust or enmity to the latter would involve a mystery beyond my comprehension for i had always believed that some apparent cause powerful in its nature and progressive in its operation must be employed to produce a change in national sentiments but no prejudice has been revived no jealousy excited to my knowledge which could have wrought a revolution unfriendly to your nation if one or a few persons in new york have given a different specimen of thinking and acting i rely too much upon your candor to     apprehend that you will impute it to the american people at large i am happy to learn that your excellency is meditating to strengthen the commercial ties that connect the two nations and that your ideas of effecting it by placing the arrangement upon the basis of mutual advantages coincide exactly with my own treaties which are not built upon reciprocal benefits are not likely to be of long duration warmly as i wish to second your views it is a subject of regret that my little acquaintance with commercial affairs and my seclusion from public life have not put me in a state of preparation to answer your several questions with accuracy i will endeavor to inform myself of the most interesting particulars and shall take a pleasure in communicating the result at present i can only remark that i think the taste for many articles of french merchandise is rather increasing still there are three circumstances which are thought to give the british merchant an advantage over all others  st their extensive credit which i confess i wish to see abolished  d their having in one place magazines containing all kinds of articles that can be required  d their knowledge of the precise kinds of merchandise and fabrics which are wanted for my own part i could wish to see the time when no credit should be given attention and experience in the american trade would enable the french merchants i apprehend to accommodate our markets in     other respects between this country and england many causes of irritation exist and it is not impossible but that the ill policy of the british court may accelerate the removal of our trade into other channels i am c george washington  0 march      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon  0 march      my dear sir your favor of the  0th came duly to hand and by mr madison i had the pleasure to hear that you had recovered from a severe illness on this event i sincerely congratulate you the conduct of the state of new hampshire has baffled all calculation and has come extremely malapropos for a favorable decision on the proposed constitution in this state for be the real cause of the late adjournment what it may the antifederal party with us do not scruple to pronounce that it was done to await the issue of this convention before it would decide and add that if this state should reject it all those who are to follow will do the same and consequently that it cannot obtain as there will be only eight states in favor of the measure      had it not been for this untoward event the opposition would have proved entirely unavailing in this state notwithstanding the unfair i might without much impropriety have made use of a harsher expression conduct which has been practised to rouse the fears and to inflame the minds of the people what will be the result now is not for me to say as i have seen but a partial return of the delegates and have little or no knowledge of the political sentiments of many of them in the northern part of the state the current of sentiment i know is generally in favor of the new form in the southern part i am told it is the reverse whilst in deciding the question and here the idea of its becoming an impediment to its separation from this operates thoroughly whilst pains have not been wanting to inculcate a belief that the general government proposed will without scruple or delay barter away their rights to navigation of the mississippi    0 the postponement in new hampshire will give strength and vigor to the opposition in new york and possibly render rhode island more tardy than she would otherwise have been if all the new england states had adopted the measure mrs washington joins in every good wish for mrs knox yourself  family c i am c george washington   april      mount vernon charles lee to charles lee mount vernon   april      dear sir i am very sorry i have not yet been able to discharge my account with the james river company for the amount of which you presented me with an order the almost total loss of my crop last year by the drought which has obliged me to purchase upwards of eight hundred barrels of corn and my other numerous and necessary demands for cash when i find it impossible to obtain what is due to me by any means have caused me more perplexity and given me     more uneasiness than i ever experienced before from the want of money in addition to the disappointments which i have met with from those who are indebted to me i have in my hands a number of indents and other public securities which i have received from time to time as the interest of some continental loanoffice certificates which are in my possession as i am so little conversant in public securities of every kind as not to know the use or value of them and hardly the difference of one species from another i have kept them by me from year to year without having an idea that they would depreciate as they were drawn for interest and never doubting but they would be received in payment of taxes at any time till i have found by the revenue law of the last session that only a particular description of them will pay the taxes of the year      the others pay all arrearages of taxes and i am informed are not worth more than two shillings and sixpence in the pound the injustice of this measure is too obvious and too glaring to pass unobserved it is taxing the honest man for his punctuality and rewarding the tardy or dishonest with the sum of seventeen shillings and sixpence in every pound which is due from him for taxes as you are now in richmond i take the liberty of enclosing to you in a letter from mr pendleton a certificate for a negro executed in the year      amounting to £   which i will thank you to negotiate for me there upon the best terms you can and pay the proceeds thereof in behalf of what is due from me to the james river company—the principal     for the negro and three years interest thereon which is all that was allowed amounted to £    which was divided into two certificates one receivable in the taxes now due which i retain to discharge part of my taxes for the year      and the other you have with this upon what principle of justice interest is allowed on the above certificates from the  st of jany      only my ideas are not sufficiently comprehensive to understand and if it should fall in your way to inquire should be glad to know as also what will or is likely to be the final result of my holding the certificates which have been given to me for interest of the money i lent the public in the day of its distress i am well apprized that these are negotiable things as above and when a person is obliged to part with them he must as with other commodities at market take what they will fetch but the object of my inquiry is to know what the final end of them will be if retained in my chest strange indeed it seems that the public officers should take in the original certificates issued new by a scale of their own reducing the money as they say to specie value give warrants for interest accordingly and then behold these specie warrants are worth two shillings and sixpence in the pound to commit them to the flames or suffer this is a matter of indifference to me there can be no justice where there are such practices you will pardon me for dwelling so long upon this subject it is a matter which does not concern me alone but must affect many others with great esteem and regard i am c     george washington   april      mount vernon james wilson to james wilson mount vernon   april      dear sir you will please to accept of my best thanks for the copy of the debates of your late convention  which you have been so polite as to send me that together with your favor of the   th ultimo was handed to me by mr madison the violent proceedings of the enemies of the proposed constitution in your state are to be regretted as disturbing the peace of society but in any other point of view they are not to be regarded for their unimportance effectually precludes any fear of their having an extensive or lasting influence and their activity holds up to view the general cast and character of them which need only to be seen to be disregarded it is impossible to say with any degree of certainty what will be the determination of the convention in this state upon the proposed plan of government i have no opportunity of gaining information respecting the matter but what comes through the medium of the newspapers or from those gentlemen who visit me as i have hardly been ten miles from my farm since my return from philadelphia some judgment may be formed when the members chosen by the several counties to serve in convention are known as their sentiments will be decided and their choice determined by their attachment or opposition to the proposed system a majority of those names i have     yet seen are said to be friendly to the constitution but these are from the northern parts of the state from whence less opposition was to be expected it is however certain that there will be a greater weight of abilities opposed to it here than in any other state i am c george washington  0 april      mount vernon thomas johnson to thomas johnson mount vernon  0 april      dear sir as well from report as from the ideas expressed to me in your letter in december last i am led to conclude that you are disposed circumstanced as our public affairs are at present to ratify the constitution which has been submitted to the people by the federal convention and under this impression i take the liberty of expressing a single sentiment on the occasion it is that an adjournment if attempted of your convention  to a later period than the decision of the question in this state will be tantamount to the rejection of the constitution i have good reasons for this opinion and am told it is the blow which the leading characters of the opposition in the next state have meditated  if it shall be found that a direct attack is not likely to succeed in yours if this be true it cannot be too much deprecated and guarded against the postponement in new hampshire although it made no reference to the convention of this state but proceeded altogether from the local circumstances     of its own is ascribed by the opposition here to complaisance towards virginia and great use is made of it an event similar to this in maryland would have the worst tendency imaginable for indecision there would certainly have considerable influence upon south carolina the only other state which is to precede virginia and submits the question almost wholly to the determination of the latter the pride of the state is already touched upon this string and will be raised much higher if there is fresh cause the sentiments of kentucky are not yet known here independent of these the parties in this state from the known or presumed opinions of the members are pretty equally balanced the one in favor of the constitution preponderates at present but a little matter cast into the opposite scale may make it heaviest if in suggesting this matter i have exceeded the proper limit i shall yet hope to be excused i have but one public wish remaining it is that in peace and retirement i may see this country rescued from the danger which is pending and rise into respectability maugre the intrigues of its public and private enemies i am with very great esteem and regard c      george washington    april      mount vernon marquis de chastellux to the marquis de chastellux mount vernon    april      my dear marquis in reading your very friendly and acceptable letter of   st decr      which came to hand by the last mail i was as you may well suppose not less delighted than surprised to meet the plain american words my wife a wife well my dear marquis i can hardly refrain from smiling to find you are caught at last i saw by the eulogium you often made on the happiness of domestic life in america that you had swallowed the bait and that you would as surely be taken one day or another as that you were a philosopher and a soldier so your day has at length come i am glad of it with all my heart and soul it is quite good enough for you now you are well served for coming to fight in favor of the american rebels all the way across the atlantic ocean by catching that terrible contagion—domestic felicity—which time like the small pox or the plague a man can have only once in his life because it commonly lasts him at least with us in america—i dont know how you manage these matters in france for his whole life time and yet after all the maledictions you so richly merit on the subject the worst wish which i can find in my heart to make against madame de chastellux and yourself is that you may neither of you ever get the better of this same—domestic felicity during the entire course of your mortal existence     if so wonderful an event should have occasioned me my dear marquis to have written in a strange style—you will understand me as clearly as if i had said what in plain english is the simple truth do me the justice to believe that i take a heartfelt interest in whatever concerns your happiness and in this view i sincerely congratulate you on your auspicious matrimonial connection i am happy to find that madame de chastellux is so intimately connected with the dutchess of orleans as i have always understood that this noble lady was an illustrious pattern of connubial love as well as an excellent model of virtue in general while you have been making love under the banner of hymen the great personages in the north have been making war under the inspiration or rather under the infatuation of mars now for my part i humbly conceive you have had much the best and wisest of the bargain for certainly it is more consonant to all the principles of reason and religion natural and revealed to replenish the earth with inhabitants rather than to depopulate it by killing those already in existence besides it is time for the age of knighterrantry and madheroism to be at an end your young military men who want to reap the harvest of laurels dont care i suppose how many seeds of war are sown but for the sake of humanity it is devoutly to be wished that the manly employment of agriculture and the humanizing benefits of commerce would supersede the waste of war and the rage of conquest and the swords might be turned     into ploughshares the spears into pruninghooks and as the scripture expresses it the nations learn war no more now i will give you a little news from this side of the water and then finish as for us we are plodding on in the dull road of peace and politics we who live in these ends of the earth only hear of the rumors of war like the roar of distant thunder it is to be hoped that our remote local situation will prevent us from being swept into its vortex the constitution which was proposed by the federal convention has been adopted by the states of massachusetts connecticut new jersey pennsylvania delaware and georgia no state has rejected it the convention of maryland is now sitting and will probably adopt it as that of south carolina is expected to do in may the other conventions will assemble early in the summer hitherto there has been much greater unanimity in favor of the proposed government than could have reasonably been expected should it be adopted and i think it will be america will lift up her head again and in a few years become respectable among the nations it is a flattering and consolatory reflection that our rising republics have the good wishes of all the philosophers patriots and virtuous men in all nations and that they look upon them as a kind of asylum for mankind god grant that we may not disappoint their honest expectations by our folly or perverseness    with sentiments of the purest attachment and esteem i have the honor to be my dear marquis c     george washington    april      mount vernon john armstrong to john armstrong mount vernon    april      dear sir from some cause or other which i do not know your favor of the  0th of february did not reach me till very lately this must apologize for its not being sooner acknowledged although colonel blaine forgot to call upon me for a letter before he left philadelphia yet i wrote a few lines to you previous to my departure from that place whether they ever got to your hands you best know i well remember the observation you made in your letter to me of last year that my domestic retirement must suffer an interruption this took place notwithstanding it was utterly repugnant to my feelings my interests and my wishes i sacrificed every private consideration and personal enjoyment to the earnest and pressing solicitations of those who saw and knew the alarming situation of our public concerns and had no other end in view but to promote the interests of their country conceiving that under those circumstances and at so critical a moment an absolute refusal to act might on my part be construed as a total disregard of my country if imputed to no worse motives although you say the same motives induce you to think that another tour of duty of this kind will fall to my lot i cannot but hope that you will be disappointed for i am so wedded to a state of retirement and find the occupations of a rural life so congenial with my feelings that to be drawn into public at my advanced   0 age would be a sacrifice that would admit of no compensation  your remarks on the impressions which will be made on the manners and sentiments of the people by the example of those who are first called to act under the proposed government are very just and i have no doubt but if the proposed constitution obtains those persons who are chosen to administer it will have wisdom enough to discern the influence which their example as rulers and legislators may have on the body of the people and will have virtue enough to pursue that line of conduct which will most conduce to the happiness of their country as the first transactions of a nation like those of an individual upon his first entrance into life make the deepest impression and are to form the leading traits in his character they will undoubtedly pursue those measures which will best tend to the restoration of public     and private faith and of consequence promote our national respectability and individual welfare that the proposed constitution will admit of amendments is acknowledged by its warmest advocates but to make such amendments as may be proposed by the several states the condition of its adoption would in my opinion amount to a complete rejection of it for upon examination of the objections which are made by the opponents in different states and the amendments which have been proposed it will be found that what would be a favorite object with one state is the very thing which is strenuously opposed by another the truth is men are too apt to be swayed by local prejudices and those who are so fond of amendments which have the particular interest of their own states in view cannot extend their ideas to the general welfare of the union they do not consider that for every sacrifice which they make they receive an ample compensation by the sacrifices which are made by other states for their benefit and that those very things which they give up operate to their advantage through the medium of the great interest in addition to these considerations it should be remembered that a constitutional door is opened for such amendments as shall be thought necessary by nine states when i reflect upon these circumstances i am surprised to find that any person who is acquainted with the critical state of our public affairs and knows the variety of views interests feelings and prejudices which must be consulted in framing a     general government for these states and how little propositions in themselves so opposite to each other will tend to promote that desirable end can wish to make amendments the ultimatum for adopting the offered system i am very glad to find that the opposition in your state however formidable it has been represented is generally speaking composed of such characters as cannot have an extensive influence their strength as well as that of those in the same class in other states seems to lie in misrepresentation and a desire to inflame the passions and to alarm the fears by noisy declamation rather than to convince the understanding by sound arguments or fair and impartial statements baffled in their attacks upon the constitution they have attempted to vilify and debase the characters who formed it but even here i trust they will not succeed upon the whole i doubt whether the opposition to the constitution will not ultimately be productive of more good than evil it has called forth in its defence abilities which would not perhaps have been otherwise expected that have thrown new light upon the science of government it has given the rights of man a full and fair discussion and explained them in so clear and forcible a manner as cannot fail to make a lasting impression upon those who read the best publications on the subject and particularly the pieces under the signature of publius there will be a greater weight of abilities opposed to the system in the convention of this state than there has been in any other but notwithstanding     the unwearied pains which have been taken and the vigorous efforts which will be made in the convention to prevent its adoption i have not the smallest doubt but it will obtain here i am sorry to hear that the college in your neighborhood  is in so declining a state as you represent it and that it is likely to suffer a further injury by the loss of dr nisbet whom you are afraid you shall not be able to support in a proper manner on account of the scarcity of cash which prevents parents from sending their children thither this is one of the numerous evils which arise from the want of a general regulating power for in a country like this where equal liberty is enjoyed where every man may reap his own harvest which by proper attention will afford him much more than is necessary for his own consumption and where there is so ample a field for every mercantile and mechanical exertion if there cannot be money found to answer the common purposes of education not to mention the necessary commercial circulation it is evident that there is something amiss in the ruling political power which requires a steady regulating and energetic hand to correct and control it that money is not to be had every mans experience tells him and the great fall in the price of property is an unequivocal and melancholy proof of it when if that property were well secured faith and justice well preserved a stable government well administered and confidence restored the tide of population and wealth would flow to us from every part of the globe and     with a due sense of the blessings make us the happiest people upon earth with sentiments of very great esteem and regard i am my dear sir c george washington    april      mount vernon marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette mount vernon    april            i notice with pleasure the additional immunities and facilities in trade which france has granted by the late royal arret to the united states i flatter myself it will have the desired effect in some measure of augmenting the commercial intercourse from the productions and wants of the two countries their trade with each other is certainly capable of great amelioration to be actuated by a spirit of unwise policy for so surely as ever we shall have an efficient government established so surely will that government impose retaliating restrictions to a certain degree upon the trade of britain at present or under our existing form of confederation it would be idle to think of making commercial regulations on our part one state passes a prohibitory law respecting some article another state opens wide the avenue for its admission one assembly makes a system another assembly unmakes it virginia in the very last session of her legislature was about to have passed some of the most extravagant and preposterous edicts on the subject of trade that ever stained the leaves of a legislative code it is in vain to hope for a remedy of these and innumerable other evils until a general government shall be adopted     the conventions of six states only have as yet accepted the new constitution no one has rejected it it is believed that the convention of maryland which is now in session and that of south carolina which is to assemble on the   th of may will certainly adopt it it is also since the elections of members of the convention have taken place in this state more generally believed that it will be adopted here than it was before those elections were made there will however be powerful and eloquent speeches on both sides of the question in the virginia convention but as pendleton wythe blair madison jones  nicholas innes and many other of our first characters will be advocates for its adoption you may suppose the weight of abilities will rest on that side henry and mason are its great adversaries  the governor if he approves it at all will do it feebly on the general merits of this proposed constitution i wrote to you some time ago my sentiments pretty freely that letter had not been received by you when you addressed to me the last of yours which has come to my hands i had never supposed that perfection could be the result of accommodation and mutual concession the opinion of mr jefferson and yourself is certainly a wise one that the constitution ought by all means to be accepted by nine states before     any attempt should be made to procure amendments for if that acceptance shall not previously take place mens minds will be so much agitated and soured that the danger will be greater than ever of our becoming a disunited people whereas on the other hand with prudence in temper and a spirit of moderation every essential alteration may in the process of time be expected you will doubtless have seen that it was owing to this conciliatory and patriotic principle that the convention of massachusetts adopted the constitution in toto but recommended a number of specific alterations and quieting explanations as an early serious and unremitting subject of attention now although it is not to be expected that every individual in society will or can be brought to agree upon what is exactly the best form of government yet there are many things in the constitution which only need to be explained in order to prove equally satisfactory to all parties for example there was not a member of the convention i believe who had the least objection to what is contended for by the advocates for a bill of rights and trial by jury the first where the people evidently retained every thing which they did not in the express terms give up was considered nugatory as you will find to have been more fully explained by mr wilson and others and as to the second it was only the difficulty of establishing a mode which should not interfere with the fixed modes of any of the states that induced the convention to leave it as a matter of future adjustment     there are other points in which opinions would be more likely to vary as for instance on the ineligibility of the same person for president after he should have served a certain course of years guarded so effectually as the proposed constitution is in respect to the prevention of bribery and undue influence in the choice of president i confess i differ widely myself from mr jefferson and you as to the necessity or expediency of rotation in that appointment the matter was fairly discussed in the convention and to my full conviction though i cannot have time or room to sum up the argument in this letter there cannot in my judgment be the least danger that the president will by any practicable intrigue ever be able to continue himself one moment in office much less perpetuate himself in it but in the last stage of corrupted morals and political depravity and even then there is as much danger that any other species of domination would prevail though when a people shall have become incapable of governing themselves and fit for a master it is of little consequence from what quarter he comes under an extended view of this part of the subject i can see no propriety in precluding ourselves from the services of any man who on some great emergency shall be deemed universally most capable of serving the public      in answer to the observations you make on the probability of my election to the presidency knowing me as you do i need only say that it has no enticing charms and no fascinating allurements for me however it might not be decent for me to say i would refuse to accept or even to speak much about an appointment which may never take place for in so doing one might possibly incur the application of the moral resulting from that fable in which the fox is represented as inveighing against the sourness of the grapes because he could not reach them all that it will be necessary to add my dear marquis in order to show my decided predilections is that at my time of life and under my circumstances the increasing infirmities of nature and the growing love of retirement do not permit me to entertain a wish beyond that of living and dying an honest man on my own farm     let those follow the pursuits of ambition and fame who have a keener relish for them or who may have more years in store for the enjoyment mrs washington while she requests that her best compliments may be presented to you joins with me in soliciting that the same friendly and affectionate memorial of our constant remembrance and good wishes may be made acceptable to madame de lafayette and the little ones i am c p s may  st since writing the foregoing letter i have received authentic accounts that the convention of maryland has ratified the new constitution by a majority of    to     george washington    april      mount vernon count de rochambeau to the count de rochambeau mount vernon    april      my dear count i have just received the letter which you did me the honor to write to me on the   th of january and am sorry to learn that the count de grasse our gallant coadjutor in the capture of cornwallis is no more yet his death is not perhaps so much to be deplored as his latter days were to be pitied it seemed as if an unfortunate and unrelenting destiny pursued him   0 to destroy the enjoyment of all earthly comfort the disastrous battle of the   th of april the loss of the favor of his king and the subsequent connexion in marriage with an unworthy woman were sufficient to have made him weary of the burden of life your goodness in endeavoring to sweeten its passage was truly commendable however it might have been marred by his own impetuosity but his frailties should now be buried in the grave with him while his name will be long deservedly dear to his country on account of his successful coöperation in the glorious campaign of      the cincinnati in some of the states have gone into mourning for him although your nation and england have avoided from prudential motives going into a war yet i fancy their affections have not been much increased by the affair in holland the feeling occasioned to france by the interference of prussia and britain may not pass away altogether without consequences i wish indeed the affairs of france to be on a footing which would enable her to be the arbiter of peace to the neighboring nations the poor dutch patriots seem by some means or other to have been left sadly in the lurch and to be reduced to a most humiliating condition and as if the two powers who reinstated the stadtholder had not done enough to set the middle nations together by the ears they have embroiled forsooth all the north of europe by bringing the turks into hostility with the two imperial courts should france join with the latter or even should she continue neuter i can scarcely conceive that the ottoman     will be permitted to hold any of their possessions in europe the torch of hostility being once kindled commonly spreads apace but it is beyond my prescience to foretell how far this flame will extend itself before it shall be entirely extinguished    george washington   may      mount vernon benjamin lincoln to benjamin lincoln mount vernon   may      my dear sir i have now to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the   th of march which should have been done at an earlier period had any thing transpired in these parts that was worth communicating i can now with pleasure inform you that the state of maryland adopted the proposed constitution last monday by a very great majority this you will undoubtedly have announced by the public papers before this letter reaches you but that state will not receive the sole benefit of its adoption it will have a very considerable influence upon the decision in virginia for it has been strongly insisted upon by the opponents in the lower and back counties in this state that maryland would reject it by a large majority the result being found so directly opposite to this assertion will operate very powerfully upon the sentiments of many who were before undecided and will tend to fix them in favor of the constitution it will if i am not misinformed have this effect upon many who are chosen to the convention and who have depended in a great measure upon the determination of     maryland to confirm their opinion but exclusive of this influence the most accurate returns of the members of the convention with their sentiments so far as they were known annexed gave a decided majority in favor of the constitution and the prevailing opinion is that it gains advocates daily i never have for my own part once doubted of its adoption here and if i have at any time been wavering in my opinion the present appearances and concurrent information would have completely fixed it  i am very sorry to find by your letter that there is so much of the spirit of insurrection yet remaining in your state and that it discovered itself so strongly in your assembly but i hope the influence of those gentlemen who are friendly to the proposed constitution and the conciliatory disposition which was shown by many of the minority in your convention will so far pervade the states as to prevent that factious spirit from gaining ground    with sentiments of the highest esteem and regard i am c     george washington   may      mount vernon george steptoe washington to george steptoe washington  mount vernon   may      dear george i yesterday received a letter from mr hanson informing me that you slept from home three nights successively and one contrary to his express prohibition complaints of this nature are extremely painful to me as it discovers a degree of impropriety in your conduct which at your time of life your good sense and discretion ought to point out to you and lead you to avoid although there is nothing criminal in your having slept with a companion of good manners and reputation as you say you have yet your absenting yourself from your own lodgings under that pretence may be productive of irregularities and disagreeable consequences and i now insist upon it in the most pointed terms that you do not repeat it without the consent and approbation of mr hanson one strong motive for my placing you in your present lodgings was that you might in your conduct out of school be guided by mr hansons advice and directions as i confide very much in his discretion and think that he would require nothing of you but what will conduce to your advantage and at the age to which you have now arrived you must be capable of distinguishing between a proper and improper line of conduct and be sensible of the advantages or disadvantages which will result to you through life from the one or the other     your future character and reputation will depend very much if not entirely upon the habits and manners which you contract in the present period of your life they will make an impression upon you which can never be effaced you should therefore be extremely cautious how you put yourself into the way of imbibing those customs which may tend to corrupt your manners or vitiate your heart i do not write to you in this style from knowing or suspecting that you are addicted to any vice but only to guard you against pursuing a line of conduct which may imperceptibly lead on to vicious courses mr hanson has done you and lawrence justice in saying that your behavior since you have been last with him has been unexceptionable except in this instance and one more which he has not mentioned and i hope this is the last complaint i shall ever hear while you remain in your present situation at least as it will prevent me from using means to regulate your behavior which will be disagreeable to us both i am your sincere friend and affectionate uncle  george washington    may      mount vernon marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette mount vernon    may      my dear marquis i have lately had the pleasure to receive the two letters by which you introduced to my acquaintance m du pont and m vanderkemp and altho those     gentlemen have not as yet been to visit me you may be persuaded that whensoever i shall have the satisfaction of receiving them it will be with all that attention to which their merits and your recommendations entitle them notwithstanding you are acquainted with mr barlow in person and with his works by reputation i thought i would just write you a line by him in order to recommend him the more particularly to your civilities mr barlow is considered by those who are good judges to be a genius of the first magnitude and to be one of those bards who hold the keys of the gate by which patriots sages and heroes are admitted to immortality such are your antient bards who are both the priest and doorkeepers to the temple of fame and these my dear marquis are no vulgar functions men of real talents in arms have commonly approved themselves patrons of the liberal arts and friends to the poets of their own as well as former times in some instances by acting reciprocally heroes have made poets and poets heroes alexander the great is said to have been enraptured with the poems of homer and to have lamented that he had not a rival muse to celebrate his actions julius cæsar is well known to have been a man of a highly cultivated understanding and taste augustus was the professed and magnificent rewarder of     poetical merit—nor did he lose the return of having his atcheivments immortalized in song the augustan age is proverbial for intellectual refinement and elegance in composition in it the harvest of laurels and bays was wonderfully mingled together the age of your louis the fourteenth which produced a multitude of great poets and great captains will never be forgotten nor will that of queen ann in england for the same cause ever cease to reflect a lustre upon the kingdom although we are yet in our cradle as a nation i think the efforts of the human mind with us are sufficient to refute by incontestable facts the doctrines of those who have asserted that every thing degenerates in america perhaps we shall be found at this moment not inferior to the rest of the world in the performances of our poets and painters notwithstanding many of the incitements are wanting which operate powerfully among older nations for it is generally understood that excellence in those sister arts has been the result of easy circumstances public encouragements and an advanced stage of society i observe that the critics in england who speak highly of the american poetical geniuses and their praises may be the more relied upon as they seem to be reluctantly extorted are not pleased with the tribute of applause which is paid to your nation it is a reason why they should be the more caressed by your nation i hardly know how it is that i am drawn thus far in observations on a subject so foreign from those in which we are mostly engaged farming and politics unless because i had little news to tell you     since i had the pleasure of writing to you by the last packet the convention of maryland has ratified the federal constitution by a majority of    to    voices that makes the seventh state which has adopted it next monday the convention in virginia will assemble—we have still good hopes of its adoption here though by no great plurality of votes south carolina has probably decided favorably before this time the plot thickens fast a few short weeks will determine the political fate of america for the present generation and probably produce no small influence on the happiness of society through a long succession of ages to come should every thing proceed with harmony and consent according to our actual wishes and expectations i will confess to you sincerely my dear marquis it will be so much beyond any thing we had a right to imagine or expect eighteen months ago that it will demonstrate as visibly the finger of providence as any possible event in the course of human affairs can ever designate it it is impracticable for you or any one who has not been on the spot to realise the change in mens minds and the progress towards rectitude in thinking and acting which will then have been made adieu my dear marquis i hope your affairs in france will subside into a prosperous train without coming to any violent crisis continue to cherish your affectionate feelings for this country and the same portion of friendship for me which you are ever sure of holding in the heart of your most sincere c     george washington   june      mount vernon james madison to james madison mount vernon   june      my dear sir i am much obliged by the few lines you wrote to me on the  th and though it is yet too soon to rejoice one cannot avoid being pleased at the auspicious opening of the business of your convention  though an ulterior opinion of the decision of this state on the constitution would at any time previous to the discussion of it in the convention have been premature yet i have never yet despaired of its adoption here what i have mostly apprehended is that the insidious arts of its opposers to alarm the fears and inflame the passions of the multitude may have produced instructions to the delegates that would shut the door against argument and be a bar to reason if this is not the case i have no doubt but that the good sense of this country will prevail against the local views of designing characters and the arrogant opinions of chagrined and disappointed men the decision of maryland and south carolina by so large majorities and the almost certain adoption of the proposed constitution by new hampshire will make all except desperate men look before they leap     into the dark consequences of rejection the ratification by eight states without a negative by three of them unanimously by six against one in another by three to one in another by two to one in two more and by all the weight of abilities and property in the other is enough one would think to produce a cessation of opposition i do not mean that this alone is sufficient to produce conviction in the mind but i think it ought to produce some change in the conduct of any man who distrusted his infallibility although i have little doubt of your having received a copy of the enclosed pamphlet i send it it is written with much good sense and moderation i conjecture but upon no certain ground that mr jay is the author of it he sent it to me some time ago since which i have received two or three more copies  with sincere esteem and affectionate regard i am ever yours george washington   june      mount vernon john jay to john jay mount vernon   june      dear sir by the last mail i had the pleasure to receive your letter of the   th of may and have now the satisfaction to congratulate you on the adoption of the constitution   0 by the convention of south carolina i am sorry to learn there is a probability that the majority of members in the new york convention will be antifederalists still i hope that some event may turn up before they assemble which may give a new complexion to the business if this state should in the intermediate time make the ninth that shall have ratified the proposed government it will i flatter myself have its due weight to show that this event is now more to be expected than heretofore i will give you a few particulars which i have from good authority and which you might not perhaps immediately obtain through any public channel of conveyance  on the day appointed for the meeting of the convention a large proportion of the members assembled and unanimously placed mr pendleton in the chair having on that and the subsequent day chosen the     rest of their officers and fixed upon the mode of conducting the business it was moved by some one of those opposed to the constitution to debate the whole by paragraphs without taking any question until the investigation should be completed this was as unexpected as acceptable to the federalists and their ready acquiescence seems to have somewhat startled the opposite party for fear they had committed themselves mr nicholas opened the business by very ably advocating the system of representation mr henry in answer went more vaguely into the discussion of the constitution intimating that the federal convention had exceeded their powers and that we had been and might be happy under the old confederation with a few alterations this called up governor randolph who is reported to have spoken with great pathos in reply and who declared that since so many of the states had adopted the proposed constitution he considered the sense of america to be already taken and that he should give his vote in favor of it without insisting previously upon amendments mr mason rose in opposition and mr madison reserved himself to obviate the objections of mr henry and colonel mason the next day thus the matter rested when the last accounts came away upon the whole the following inferences seem to have been drawn that mr randolphs declaration will have considerable effect with those who had hitherto been wavering that mr henry and colonel mason took different and awkward ground and by no means     equalled the public expectation in their speeches that the former has probably receded somewhat from his violent measures to coalesce with the latter and that the leaders of the opposition appear rather chagrined and hardly to be decided as to their mode of opposition the sanguine friends of the constitution counted upon a majority of twenty at their first meeting which number they imagine will be greatly increased while those equally strong in their wishes but more temperate in their habits of thinking speak less confidently of the greatness of the majority and express apprehensions of the arts that may yet be practised to excite alarms with the members from the western district kentucky all however agree that the beginning has been auspicious as could possibly have been expected a few days will now ascertain us of the result with sentiments of the highest esteem and regard i am c george washington   june      mount vernon william smith to william smith and others of baltimore mount vernon   june      gentlemen captain barney has just arrived here in the miniature ship called the federalist and has done me the honor to offer that beautiful curiosity as a present to me on your part i pray you gentlemen to accept the warmest expressions of my sensibility for this specimen of american ingenuity in which the exactitude of the proportions the neatness of the workmanship and the elegance of the decorations which make your present fit to be preserved in a cabinet of curiosities     at the same time that they exhibit the skill and taste of the artists demonstrate that americans are not inferior to any people whatever in the use of mechanical instruments and the art of shipbuilding the unanimity of the agricultural state of maryland in general as well as of the commercial town of baltimore in particular expressed in their recent decision on the subject of a general government will not i persuade myself be without its due efficacy on the minds of their neighbors who in many instances are intimately connected not only by the nature of their produce but by the ties of blood and the habits of life under these circumstances i cannot entertain an idea that the voice of the convention of this state which is now in session will be dissonant from that of her nearly allied sister who is only separated by the potomac you will permit me gentlemen to indulge my feelings in reiterating the heartfelt wish that the happiness of this country may equal the desires of its sincerest friends and that the patriotic town of which you are inhabitants and in the prosperity of which i have always found myself strongly interested may not only continue to increase in the same wonderful manner it has formerly done but that its trade manufactures and other resources of wealth may be placed permanently in a more flourishing situation than they have hitherto been i am with respect c      george washington    june      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon    june      my dear sir i received your letter of the   th of may just when i was on the eve of a departure for fredericksburg to pay a visit to my mother from whence i returned only last evening the information of the accession of south carolina to the new government since your letter gives us a new subject of mutual felicitations it was to be hoped that this auspicious event would have considerable influence upon the proceedings of the convention of virginia but i do not find that to have been the case affairs in the convention for some time past have not worn so good an aspect as we could have wished and indeed the acceptance of the constitution has become more doubtful than it was thought to be at their first meeting the purport of the intelligence i received from my private letters by the last nights mail is that every     species of address and artifice has been put in practice by the antifederalists to create jealousies and excite alarms much appears to depend upon the final part which the kentucky members will take into whose minds apprehensions of unreal dangers respecting the navigation of the mississippi and their organization into a separate state have been industriously infused  each side seems to think at present that it has a small majority however it shall turn it will be very inconsiderable though for my own part i cannot but imagine if any decision is had it will be in favor of the adoption my apprehension rather is that a strenuous and successful effort may be made for an adjournment under an idea of opening a correspondence with those who are opposed to the constitution in other states colonel oswald has been at richmond it is said with letters from the antifederalists in new york and pennsylvania to their coadjutors in this state     the resolution which came from the antifederalists much to the astonishment of the other party that no question should be taken until the whole plan should have been discussed paragraph by paragraph and the remarkable tardiness in their proceedings for the convention has been able as yet only to get through the second or third section are thought by some to have been designed to protract business until the time when the assembly is to convene that is the   d instant in order to have a more colorable pretext for an adjournment but notwithstanding the resolution there has been much desultory debating and the opposers of the constitution are reported to have gone generally into the merits of the question i know not how the matter may be but a few days will now determine i am sorry to find not only from your intimations but also from many of the returns in the late papers that there should be so great a majority against the constitution in the convention of new york and yet i can hardly conceive from motives of policy and prudence they will reject it absolutely if either this state or new hampshire should make the ninth in adopting it as that measure which gives efficacy to the system must place any state that shall actually have refused its assent to the new union in a very awkward and disagreeable predicament by a letter i have just received from a young gentleman who lives with me but who is now at home in new hampshire  i am advised that there is     every prospect that the constitution will be adopted in that state almost immediately upon the meeting of the convention i cannot but hope then that the states which may be disposed to make a secession will think often and seriously on the consequences colo humphreys who is still here occupied with literary pursuits desires to be remembered in terms of the sincerest friendship to you and yours mrs washington and the family offer with me their best compliments to mrs knox and the little ones i am c george washington    june      mount vernon marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette mount vernon    june      my dear marquis i like not much the situation of affairs in france the bold demands of the parliaments and the decisive tone of the king show that but little more irritation would be necessary to blow up the spark of discontent into a flame that might not easily be quenched if i were to advise i should say that great moderation should be used on both sides let it not my dear marquis be considered as a derogation from the good opinion that i entertain of your prudence when i caution you as an individual desirous of signalizing yourself in the cause of your country and freedom against running into extremes and prejudicing your cause the king though i think from every thing i have been able to learn he is really a goodhearted though a warmspirited man if thwarted injudiciously in the execution of prerogatives     that belonged to the crown and in plans which he conceives calculated to promote the national good may disclose qualities he has been little thought to possess on the other hand such a spirit seems to be awakened in the kingdom as if managed with extreme prudence may produce a gradual and tacit revolution much in favor of the subjects by abolishing lettres de cachet and defining more accurately the powers of government it is a wonder to me there should be found a single monarch who does not realize that his own glory and felicity must depend on the prosperity and happiness of his people how easy is it for a sovereign to do that which shall not only immortalize his name but attract the blessings of millions in a letter i wrote you a few days ago by mr barlow but which might not possibly have reached new york until after his departure i mentioned the accession of maryland to the proposed government and gave you the state of politics to that period since which the convention of south carolina has ratified the constitution by a great majority that of this state has been sitting almost three weeks and so nicely does it appear to be balanced that each side asserts that it has a preponderancy of votes in its favor it is probable therefore the majority will be small let it fall on whichever part it may i am inclined to believe it will be in favor of the adoption the conventions of new york and new hampshire both assemble this week a large proportion of members with the governor at their head in the former are said to be opposed to the government in contemplation new hampshire it is thought will     adopt it without much hesitation or delay it is a little strange that the men of large property in the south should be more afraid that the constitution will produce an aristocracy or a monarchy than the genuine democratical people of the east such are our actual prospects the accession of one state more will complete the number which by the constitutional provision will be sufficient in the first instance to carry the government into effect and then i expect that many blessings will be attributed to our new government which are now taking their rise from that industry and frugality into the practice of which the people have been forced from necessity i really believe that there never was so much labor and economy to be found before in the country as at the present moment if they persist in the habits they are acquiring the good effects will soon be distinguishable when the people shall find themselves secure under an energetic government when foreign nations shall be disposed to give us equal advantages in commerce from dread of retaliation when the burdens of war shall be in a manner done away by the sale of western lands when the seeds of happiness which are sown here shall begin to expand themselves and when every one under his own vine and figtree shall begin to taste the fruits of freedom then all these blessings for all these blessings will come will be referred to the fostering influence of the new government whereas many causes will have conspired to produce them you see i am not less enthusiastic than i ever have been if a belief that peculiar scenes of felicity are reserved   0 for this country is to be denominated enthusiasm indeed i do not believe that providence has done so much for nothing it has always been my creed that we should not be left as an awful monument to prove that mankind under the most favorable circumstances for civil liberty and happiness are unequal to the task of governing themselves and therefore made for a master we have had a backward spring and summer with more rain and cloudy weather than almost ever has been known still the appearance of crops in some parts of the country is favorable as we may generally expect will be the case from the difference of soil and variety of climate in so extensive a region insomuch that i hope some day or another we shall become a storehouse and granary for the world in addition to our former channels of trade salted provisions butter and cheese are exported with profit from the eastern states to the east indies in consequence of a contract large quantities of flour are lately sent from baltimore for supplying the garrison of gibraltar i am c george washington    june      mount vernon richard henderson to richard henderson  mount vernon    june      sir your favor of the  th instant was lodged at my house while i was absent on a visit to my mother i am now taking the earliest opportunity of noticing its     contents and those of its enclosure willing as i am to give satisfaction so far as i am able to every reasonable inquiry and this is certainly not only so but may be highly important and interesting i must however rather deal in general than particular observations as i think you will be able from the length of your residence in the country and the extensiveness of your acquaintance with its affairs to make the necessary applications and add the proper details nor would i choose that my interference in the business should be transmitted lest in a malicious world it might be represented that i was officiously using the arts of seduction to depopulate other countries for the sake of peopling our own in the first place it is a point conceded that america under an efficient government will be the most favorable country of any in the world for persons of industry and frugality possessed of a moderate capital to inhabit it is also believed that it will not be less advantageous to the happiness of the lowest class of people because of the equal distribution of property the great plenty of unoccupied lands and the facility of procuring the means of subsistence the scheme of purchasing a good tract of freehold estate and bringing out a number of ablebodied men indented for a certain time appears to be indisputably a rational one all the interior arrangements of transferring the property and commencing the establishment you are as well acquainted with as i can possibly be it might be considered as a point of more difficulty to decide upon the place which should be most proper     for a settlement although i believe that emigrants from other countries to this who shall be welldisposed and conduct themselves properly would be treated with equal friendship and kindness in all parts of it yet in the old settled states land is so much occupied and the value so much enhanced by the contiguous cultivation that the price would in general be an objection the land in the western country or that on the ohio like all others has its advantages and disadvantages the neighborhood of the savages and the difficulty of transportation were the great objections the danger of the first will soon cease by the strong establishments now taking place the inconveniences of the second will be in a great degree remedied by opening the internal navigation no colony in america was ever settled under such favorable auspices as that which has just commenced at the muskingum information property and strength will be its characteristics i know many of the settlers personally and that there never were men better calculated to promote the welfare of such a community if i was a young man just preparing to begin the world or if advanced in life and had a family to make a provision for i know of no country where i should rather fix my habitation than in some part of that region for which the writer of the queries seems to have a predilection he might be informed that his namesake and distant relation general st clair is not only in high repute but that he is governor of all the territory westward of the ohio and that there is a gentleman to wit mr joel barlow gone from new york     by the last french packet who will be in london in the course of this year and who is authorized to dispose of a very large body of land in that country the author of the queries may then be referred to the information for those who would wish to remove to america and published in europe in the year      by the great philosopher dr franklin short as it is it contains almost every thing that needs to be known on the subject of migrating to this country you may find that excellent little treatise in careys american museum for september      it is worthy of being republished in scotland and every other part of europe as to the european publications respecting the united states they are commonly very defective the abbé raynal is quite erroneous guthrie though somewhat better informed is not absolutely correct there is now an american geography preparing for the press by a mr morse of new haven in connecticut which from the pains the author has taken in travelling through the states and acquiring information from the principal characters in each will probably be much more exact and useful of books at present existing mr jeffersons notes on virginia will give the best idea of this part of the continent to a foreigner and the american farmers letters written by mr crevecœur commonly called mr st john the french consul in new york who actually resided twenty years as a farmer in that state will afford a great deal of profitable and amusive information respecting the private life of the americans as well as the progress of agriculture manufactures     and arts in their country perhaps the picture he gives though founded on fact is in some instances embellished with rather too flattering circumstances i am c george washington    june      mount vernon charles carter to charles carter mount vernon    june      dear sir when mrs washington was at the church in fredericksburg she perceived the tomb of her father the late john dandridge esqr to be much out of sorts and being desirous to have it done up again will you permit me to request the favor of you to engage a workman to do this the cost of which i will remit as soon as you shall signify to me that the work is accomplished and inform me of its amount i would thank you my dear sir for the ascertainment of this before hand i have not inclining to dispute accounts felt in too many instances the expansion of tradesmens consciences when no previous agreement has been made ever to put it in their power to charge what they please in future my best wishes in which mrs washington joins me are tendered to mrs carter with much truth george washington    june      mount vernon charles cotesworth pinckney to charles cotesworth pinckney mount vernon    june      dear sir i had the pleasure to receive a day or two ago your obliging letter of the   th of last month in which you advise me of the ratification of the federal     constitution by south carolina by a more rapid water conveyance that good news had some few days before arrived at baltimore so as to have been very opportunely communicated to the convention of this state in session at richmond it is with great satisfaction i have it now in my power to inform you that on the   th instant the delegates of virginia adopted the constitution in toto by a division of eightynine in favor of it to seventynine against it and that notwithstanding the majority is so small yet in consequence of some conciliatory conduct and recommendatory amendments a happy acquiescence it is said is likely to terminate the business here in as favorable a manner as could possibly have been expected no sooner had the citizens of alexandria who are federal to a man received the intelligence by the mail last night than they determined to devote this day to festivity but their exhilaration was greatly increased and a much keener zest given to their enjoyment by the arrival of an express two hours before day with the news that the convention of new hampshire had on the   st instant acceded to the new confederacy by a majority of eleven voices that is to say fiftyseven to fortysix thus the citizens of alexandria when convened constituted the first public company in america which had the pleasure of pouring a libation to the prosperity of the ten states that had actually adopted the general government the day itself is memorable for more reasons than one it was recollected     that this day is the anniversary of the battles of sullivans island and monmouth i have just returned from assisting at the entertainment and mention these details unimportant as they are in themselves the rather because i think we may rationally indulge the pleasing hope that the union will now be established upon a durable basis and that providence seems still disposed to favor the members of it with unequalled opportunities for political happiness from the local situation as well as the other circumstances of north carolina i should be truly astonished if that state should withdraw itself from the union on the contrary i flatter myself with a confident expectation that more salutary counsels will certainly prevail at present there is more doubt how the question will be immediately disposed of in new york for it seems to be understood that there is a majority in the convention opposed to the adoption of the new federal system yet it is hardly to be supposed or rather in my judgment it is irrational to suppose they will reject a government which from an unorganized embryo ready to be stifled with a breath has now in the maturity of its birth assumed a confirmed bodily existence or to drop the metaphor the point in debate has at least shifted its ground from policy to expediency the decision of ten states cannot be without its operation perhaps the wisest way in this crisis will be not to attempt to accept or reject but to adjourn until the people in some parts of the state can consider the magnitude of the question and of the consequences involved in it more     coolly and deliberately after new york shall have acted then only one little state will remain suffice it to say it is universally believed that the scales are ready to drop from the eyes and the infatuation to be removed from the heart of rhode island may this be the case before that inconsiderate people shall have filled up the measure of iniquity before it shall be too late mrs washington and all with us desire their best compliments may be presented to mrs pinckney and yourself wishing that mine may also be made acceptable to you both i am c george washington    june      mount vernon benjamin lincoln to benjamin lincoln mount vernon    june      my dear sir i beg you will accept my thanks for the communications handed to me in your letter of the  d instant and my congratulations on the increasing good dispositions of the citizens of your state of which the late elections are strongly indicative no one can rejoice more than i do at every step the people of this great country take to preserve the union to establish good order and government and to render the nation happy at home and respectable abroad no country upon earth ever had it more in its power to attain these blessings than united america wondrously strange then and much to be regretted indeed would it be were we to neglect the means and to depart from the road which providence has     pointed us to so plainly i cannot believe it will ever come to pass the great governor of the universe has led us too long and too far on the road to happiness and glory to forsake us in the midst of it by folly and improper conduct proceeding from a variety of causes we may now and then get bewildered but i hope and trust that there is good sense and virtue enough left to recover the right path before we shall be entirely lost you will before this letter can have reached you have heard of the ratification of the new government by this state the final question without previous amendments was taken the   th ayes    noes   —but something recommendatory or declaratory of the rights the ultimate decision this account and the news of the adoption by new hampshire arrived in alexandria nearly about the same time on friday evening and as you will suppose was cause for great rejoicing among the inhabitants who have not i believe an antifederalist among them our accounts from richmond are that the debates through all the different stages of the business though animated have been conducted with great dignity and temper that the final decision exhibited an awful and solemn scene and that there is every reason to expect a perfect acquiescence therein by the minority not only the declaration of mr henry the great leader of it who has signified that though he can never be reconciled to the constitution in its present form and shall give it every constitutional opposition in his power yet that he will submit to it peaceably as he thinks     every good citizen ought to do when it is in exercise and that he will both by precept and example inculcate this doctrine to all around him there is little doubt entertained here now of the ratification of the proposed constitution by north carolina and however great the opposition to it may be in new york the leaders thereof will i should conceive consider well the consequences before they reject it with respect to rhode island the power that governs there has so far baffled all calculation on this question that no man would choose to hazard an opinion lest he might be suspected of participating in its phrensy  you have every good wish of this family and the sincere regard of your affectionate c george washington    july      mount vernon john jay to john jay mount vernon    july      dear sir a few days ago i had the pleasure to receive your letter from poughkeepsie since which i have not obtained any authentic advices of the proceedings of your convention the clue you gave me to penetrate into the principles and wishes of the four classes of men among you who are opposed to the constitution has opened a large field for reflection and conjecture   0 the accession of ten states must operate forcibly with all the opposition except the class which is comprehended in your last description  before this time you will probably have come to some decision while we are waiting the result with the greatest anxiety our printers are not so fortunate as to obtain any papers from the eastward mine which have generally been more regular have however frequently been interrupted for some time past it is extremely to be lamented that a new arrangement in the postoffice unfavorable to the circulation of intelligence should have taken place at the instant when the momentous question of a general government was to come before the people i have seen no good apology not even in mr hazards publication for deviating from the old custom of permitting printers to exchange their papers by the mail that practice was a great public convenience and gratification if the privilege was not from convention an original right it had from prescription strong pretensions for continuance especially at so interesting a period the interruption in that mode of conveyance has not only given great concern to the friends of the constitution who wished the public to be possessed     of every thing that might be printed on both sides of the question but it has afforded its enemies very plausible pretexts for dealing out their scandals and exciting jealousies by inducing a belief that the suppression of intelligence at that critical juncture was a wicked trick of policy contrived by an aristocratic junto now if the postmastergeneral with whose character i am unacquainted and therefore would not be understood to form an unfavorable opinion of his motives has any candid advisers who conceive that he merits the public employment they ought to counsel him to wipe away the aspersion he has incautiously brought upon a good cause if he is unworthy of the office he holds it would be well that the ground of a complaint apparently so general should be inquired into and if founded redressed through the medium of a better appointment it is a matter in my judgment of primary importance that the public mind should be relieved from inquietude on this subject i know it is said that the irregularity or defect has happened accidentally in consequence of the contract for transporting the mail on horseback instead of having it carried in the stages but i must confess i could never account upon any satisfactory principles for the inveterate enmity with which the postmastergeneral is asserted to be actuated against that valuable institution it has often been understood by wise politicians and enlightened patriots that giving a facility to the means of travelling for strangers and of intercourse for     citizens was an object of legislative concern and a circumstance highly beneficial to any country in england i am told they consider the mailcoaches as a great modern improvement in their postoffice regulations i trust we are not too old or too proud to profit by the experience of others in this article the materials are amply within our reach i am taught to imagine that the horses the vehicles and the accommodations in america with very little encouragement might in a short period become as good as the same articles are to be found in any country of europe and at the same time i am sorry to learn that the line of stages is at present interrupted in some parts of new england and totally discontinued at the southward i mention these suggestions only as my particular thoughts on an establishment which i had conceived to be of great importance your proximity to the person in question and connexion with the characters in power will enable you to decide better than i can on the validity of the allegations and in that case to weigh the expediency of dropping such hints as may serve to give satisfaction to the public with sentiments of the highest consideration and regard i am c p s—since writing the foregoing i have been favored with your letter which was begun on the  th and continued till the  th and thank you for the information therein contained your next will i hope announce the ratification by your state without previous amendments     george washington    july      mount vernon noah webster to noah webster mount vernon    july      sir i duly received your letter of the   th of july and can only answer you briefly and generally from memory that a combined operation of the land and naval forces of france and america for the year      was preconcerted the year before that the point at attack was not absolutely agreed upon because it would be easy for the count de grasse in good time before his departure from the west indies to give notice by express at what place he could most conveniently first touch to receive advices because it could not be foreknown where the enemy would be most susceptible of impression and because we having the command of the water and with sufficient means of conveyance could transport ourselves to any spot with the greatest celerity that it was determined by me nearly twelve months beforehand at all hazards to give out and cause it to be believed by the highest military as well as civil officers that new york was the destined place of attack for the important purpose of inducing the eastern  middle states to make greater exertions in furnishing specific supplies than they otherwise would have done as well as for the interesting purpose of rendering the enemy less prepared elsewhere that these means and these alone artillery boats stores and provisions were in seasonable preparation to move with the utmost rapidity to any part of the continent for the difficulty consisted more in providing than knowing how to apply the     military apparatus that before the arrival of the count de grasse it was the fixed determination to strike the enemy in the most vulnerable quarter so as to ensure success with moral certainty as our affairs were then in the most ruinous train imaginable that new york was thought to be beyond our effort and consequently the only hesitation that remained was between an attack upon the british army in virginia or that in charleston and finally that by the intervention of several communications and some incidents which cannot be detailed in a letter and which were altogether unknown to the late quartermastergeneral of the army who was informed of nothing but what related to the immediate duties of his own department the hostile post in virginia from being a provisional and strongly expected became the definitive and certain object of the campaign i only add that it never was in contemplation to attack new york unless the garrison should first have been so far disgarnished to carry on the southern operations as to render our success in the siege of that place as infallible as any future military event can ever be made for i repeat it and dwell upon it again and again some splendid advantage whether upon a larger or smaller scale was almost immaterial was so essentially necessary to revive the expiring hopes and languid exertions of the country at the crisis in question that i never would have consented to embark in any enterprise wherein from the most rational plan and accurate calculations the favorable issue should not have appeared as clear to my view     as a ray of light the failure of an attempt against the posts of the enemy could in no other possible situation during the war have been so fatal to our cause that much trouble was taken and finesse used to misguide and bewilder sir henry clinton in regard to the real object by fictitious communications as well as by making a deceptive provision of ovens forage and boats in his neighborhood is certain nor were less pains taken to deceive our own army for i had always conceived when the imposition did not completely take place at home it could never sufficiently succeed abroad your desire of obtaining truth is very laudable i wish i had more leisure to gratify it as i am equally solicitous the undisguised verity should be known many circumstances will unavoidably be misconceived and misrepresented notwithstanding most of the papers which may properly be deemed official are preserved yet the knowledge of innumerable things of a more delicate and secret nature is confined to the perishable remembrance of some few of the present generation i am with sentiments of esteem and regard sir c george washington   august      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress mount vernon   august      my dear sir your favors of the   st and   th of last month came duly to hand the latter contained the pleasing and i may add though i could not reconcile it     to any ideas i entertained of common policy unexpected account of the unconditional ratification of the constitution by the state of new york that north carolina will hesitate long in its choice i can scarcely believe but what rhode island will do is more difficult to say though not worth a conjecture as the conduct of the majority there has hitherto baffled all calculation the place proper for the new congress to meet at will unquestionably undergo if it has not already done it much investigation but there are certain things which are so selfevident in their nature as to speak for themselves this possibly may be one where the true point lies i will not undertake to decide but there can be no hesitation i think in pronouncing that in all societies if the band or cement is strong and interesting enough to hold the body together the several parts should submit to the inconveniences for the benefits which they derive from the conveniences of the compact      we have nothing in these parts worth communicating towards new york we look for whatever is interesting till the states begin to act under the new form which will be an important epoch in the annals of this country with sentiments of sincere friendship and affection i am yours c george washington   august      mount vernon george steptoe washington to george steptoe washington mount vernon   august      dear george it was with equal pain and surprise that i was informed by colonel hanson on monday last of your unjustifiable behavior in rescuing your brother from that chastisement which was due to his improper conduct and which you know because you have been told it in explicit language he was authorized to administer whensoever he should deserve it such     refractory behavior on your part i consider as an insult equally offered to myself after the above communications and i shall continue to view it in that light till you have made satisfactory acknowledgments to colonel hanson for the offence given him it is as much my wish and intention to see justice done to you and your brother as it is to punish either when it is merited but there are proper modes by which this is to be obtained and it is to be sought by a fair and candid representation of facts which can be supported and not by vague complaints disobedience perverseness or disobliging conduct which make enemies without producing the smallest good so often and strenuously have i endeavored to inculcate this advice and to show you the advantages which are to be expected from close application to your studies that it is unnecessary to repeat it if the admonitions of friendship are lost other methods must be tried which cannot be more disagreeable to you than it would be to one who wishes to avoid it who is solicitous to see you and your brother the only remaining sons of your father turn out well and who is very desirous of continuing your affectionate uncle      george washington    august      mount vernon charles pettit to charles pettit mount vernon    august      sir i have to acknowledge with much sensibility the receipt of your letter dated the  th instant in which you offer your congratulations on the prospect of an established government whose principles seem calculated to secure the benefits of society to the citizens of the united states and in which you also give a more accurate state of federal politics in pennsylvania than i had before received it affords me unfeigned satisfaction to find that the acrimony of parties is much abated doubtless there are defects in the proposed system which may be remedied in a constitutional mode i am truly pleased to learn that those who have been considered as its most violent opposers will not only acquiesce peaceably but coöperate in its organization and content themselves with asking amendments in the manner prescribed by the constitution the great danger in my view was that every thing might be thrown into the last stage of confusion before any government whatsoever could be established and that  00 we should suffer a political shipwreck without the aid of one friendly star to guide us into port every real patriot must have lamented that private feuds and local politics should have unhappily insinuated themselves into and in some measure obstructed the discussion of a great national question a just opinion that the people when rightly informed will decide in a proper manner ought certainly to have prevented all intemperate or precipitate proceedings on a subject of so much magnitude nor should a regard to common decency have suffered the zealots in the minority to stigmatize the authors of the constitution as conspirators and traitors however unfavorably individuals blinded by passion and prejudice might have thought of the characters who composed the convention the election of those characters by the legislatures of the several states and the reference of their proceedings to the free determination of their constituents did not carry the appearance of a private combination to destroy the liberties of their country nor did the outrageous disposition which some indulged in traducing and vilifying the members seem much calculated to produce concord or accommodation for myself i expected not to be exempted from obloquy any more than others it is the lot of humanity but if the shafts of malice had been aimed at me in ever so pointed a manner on this occasion shielded as i was by a consciousness of having acted in conformity to what i believed my duty they would have fallen blunted from their mark it is known to  0  some of my countrymen and can be demonstrated to the conviction of all that i was in a manner constrained to attend the general convention in compliance with the earnest and pressing desires of many of the most respectable characters in different parts of the continent at my age and in my circumstances what sinister object or personal emolument had i to seek after in this life the growing infirmities of age and the increasing love of retirement daily confirm my decided predilection for domestic life and the great searcher of human hearts is my witness that i have no wish which aspires beyond the humble and happy lot of living and dying a private citizen on my own farm your candor and patriotism in endeavoring to moderate the jealousies and remove the prejudices which a particular class of citizens had conceived against the new government are certainly very commendable and must be viewed as such by all true friends to their country in this description i shall fondly hope i have a right to comprehend myself and shall conclude by professing a grateful sense of your favorable opinion for me i am c george washington    august      mount vernon john beale bordley to john beale bordley mount vernon    august            no wheat that has ever yet fallen under my observation exceeds the wheat which some years ago i cultivated extensively but which from inattention  0  during my absence of almost nine years from home has got so mixed or degenerated as scarcely to retain any of its original characteristics properly but if the march of the hessian fly southerly cannot be arrested and colo morgans experiments are corroborated by others of equal skill and attention it must yield to the palm the yellow bearded wheat which alone it is said is able to resist the depredations of that destructive insect this makes your present of it to me more valuable i shall cultivate it with care the cape wheat i have cultivated three years successively—the frost of the last year almost destroyed it—in neither did it produce a full grain though a large one—i have just harvested a little of two kinds of wheat sent me by arthur young esqr of england one of which he says is called the harrison wheat and is in high estimation in that country the other is a large white wheat to which i do not recollect he has given any name—the seed being injured in its passage came up badly and with difficulty any of it was preserved from weads c—no conclusive opinion therefore can be formed of either from the trial of this year but if there is any thing which indicates a superior quality in it next i will reserve some of the seed for you that the system if it deserves the appelation of one of corn wheat hay has been injurious and if continued would prove ruinous to our lands i believe no person who has attended to the ravages which have been produced by it in our fields is at a loss to decide but with deference let me ask if the substitute  0  you propose is the best that can be devised wheat follows corn here are not only two corn crops but those of the most exhausting nature following each other without the intervention of a restorative when by the approved courses now practiced in england grain and what are called fallow crops succeed each other alternately though i am not strongly attached to a particular course being open to conviction yet that which has obtained most in my mind and which i have been endeavoring for it is not easy to go fully into any system which produces a material change at once is the following which for the more perfect understanding of it shall have dates to their respective growths of the crops by the usual mode it is scarcely necessary to observe we have three fields—viz—one in corn one in wheat and one in hay—by my plan these three fields are divided into six—for instance one of them say no   is planted with corn   feet by  —single stalks with irish potatoes or carrots or partly both between that corn planted in this manner will yield as much to the acre as in any other that the quantity of potatoes is at least quadruple the quantity of corn and that potatoes do not exhaust the land are facts well established in my mind—in april      it is sown with buck wheat for manure which is plowed in before harvest when the seed begins to ripen and there is enough to seed the ground a second time in july it is again plowed in which gives two dressings to the land at the expence only of a bushel of b w and the plowings which would otherwise be essential for a summer  0  fallow—in august after the putrefaction and fermentation is over wheat is sown and in    0 harvested—in     —the best—and earliest kind of indian pease are sown in broad cast to be mown when generally ripe since the adoption of this course and the progress that has been made to carry it into effect i have had too much cause to be convinced that pease harvested in this manner is a considerable exhaustion of the soil—i have some thoughts therefore of substituting a medley—of pease buck wheat for seed turnips pomkins c in such parts of the field as will be useful on the farm and all of them preparatives of the ensuing crop in      spring barley or oats or equal quantities of each will follow with clover—the latter to be fed with light stock after harvest—in      the field remains in clover for hay or grazing according to circumstances in      it comes again into corn and goes on as before it may be remarked here as an objection to this system—that wheat in the best farming counties in england follows the clover hay—is sown on a single plowing—and has been found profitable from practice—my reasons for departing from that mode are— st our plowing is not equal to theirs of course the clover is not so well buried nor the ensuing wheat crop so free from grass as theirs and  dly if we sow wheat at an early and proper period we loose a valuable part of the clover crop—whereas the ground for corn need not be broken till the season for grazing is over and the stock in the farm yard by the tillage too which the corn crop ought to receive followed by b  0  w twice plowed in weeds and grass must be entirely eradicated to contrast the probable yield of this with the old course of corn wheat and hay—suppose a farm of  00 acres of arable land old acres bush bush     00 of maiz    ½ is    0    £     0 0  00 wheat    is  00     0 0 0  00 pasture       0 0 diffe  £      0           0 new acres b bush     0 of maiz at   ½ is        £       0 potatoes between the corn rows will quadruple the corn but allowing for seed accidence c only double     0        0 0  0 of wheat    is   0         0 0  0 of barley   0 is  00         0 0  0 of clover hay—   tons   0     0 0  0 of pease    bush  00        0 0  0 of pasture £       0 in the above statement as much i conceive is allowed to the old and taken from the new course as can be done with justice—the pastures of the latter will be fine and improving those of the former are continually declining and washing into gullies—the handmachine spoken of by you for sowing clover  0  seed i have wished to see but have never yet seen one—but i cannot conceive that by this or any other contrivance a bushel of seed can be made to subserve  0 acres of land and without a considerable mixture of other grass seeds which would in a manner be washed in so short a lay as is proposed by either of our systems i have been informed that you have in possession one of winlaws machines for threshing wheat pray how do you approve of it on trial many of these newly invented things meet the approbation of the moment but will not stand the test of constant use or the usage of common laborers—i have requested mr young if this machine has supported its reputation—either in his opinion or the judgment of those on whom he can rely to send me one i am c george washington    august      mount vernon count de moustier to the count de moustier mount vernon    august      sir in the letter i did myself the honor to address to your excellency on the   th of last march i intimated that as soon as i should have obtained more particular information concerning the commercial intercourse between france and the united states i would most willingly communicate the result ill prepared as i still am to treat of a subject so complicated in its nature and so extensive in its consequences i will now hazard a few facts and general observations without confining myself strictly to your  0  questions to which however you may find there will be a constant allusion respecting the utility or hurtfulness of the tobacco contract between mr morris and the farmersgeneral i have heard so many specious arguments on one side and the other that i find myself embarrassed in making a fair judgment in ordinary cases i know that all exclusive privileges and even partial monopolies are pernicious how far in this instance the contract has been only a transference of the business from the foreign agents english or scottish who used to conduct it into other hands and whether the same exportations in quantity would have been made directly to france through more advantageous channels i cannot pretend to determine a free competition in the purchase of that article here as well as in the sale at the place of market it seems reasonable to conclude would be mutually beneficial to both nations however it might be inconvenient to individuals though the present contract will soon expire of course and leave an equal field of speculation on this side of the atlantic i have been taught to believe that the farmersgeneral will not so readily give up their share in the monopoly on the other so the business must in all probability revert to its original channel in reply to your second third and fourth questions i would only briefly observe that we are yet scarcely sufficiently acquainted with the coarse french woollens and their lowest prices to determine how far they can come in rivalship with those of britain the  0  prevailing opinion is infavor of the latter but i see no reason why the former when calculated for the particular purpose may not be made equally cheap and good as to other articles of importation directly from france they might consist in superfine broadcloths particularly blue which can be afforded cheaper and better than from england glass gloves ribbons silks cambrics plain lawns linens printed goods wine brandy oil fruit and in general every thing necessary for carrying on the indian trade from the islands sugar and coffee in addition to the molasses and rum which alone are permitted to be exported to the united states at present our produce in return to europe might comprehend tobacco as the staple from this state and from the states aggregately wheat rice other grain bread flour fish fish oil potashes pearlashes skins furs peltry indigo madder different dyeing woods lumber naval stores iron coals and ships ready built to the islands lumber bar iron coals live stock and provisions of all kinds it may be mentioned here as a first principle of extending the intercourse and as a theory which will be found incontestably true in experiment that in proportion as france shall increase the facility of our making remittances in the same ratio shall we increase the consumption of her produce and manufactures common sense and sound policy speak thus on our part we can furnish new materials of great value and our ability to do it will augment with our population every day we want no money for them  0  and we desire no credit may be given to us we cannot manufacture fine articles so cheaply as we can import them and must while we continue an agricultural people be supplied from some quarter we offer you the preference and will take in different goods to the amount received from us in our staple commodities this doctrine has been already verified so far as an opportunity has been afforded to observe the effect the use of french brandy in common taverns as well as private houses has been substituted for two or three years past very much in the room of jamaica rum probably not less than twentyfour thousand gallons have been imported into this state in one year the consumption of french wines is also much greater than it has formerly been and may by a moderate calculation amount to between one half and one third of all that is imported the demand for both these articles might still be extended with the means of making remittances not much french salt is made use of for curing provisions in virginia the opinion is that it is not so clean as that imported from other parts of europe if it was properly purified it might and certainly would be brought out as ballast in great quantities and find a ready market about half the exports from virginia are carried in american bottoms the remainder principally in british bottoms there are however a number of other foreign vessels employed in the trade i know not of any other equivalents than those to be derived by france from the extension of her commerce   0 which we can give for any new favors in your islands  under the present rigorous restrictions it is thought that trade is unprofitable for us and will decay or be disused as soon as other avenues for receiving our produce shall be gradually opened the maritime genius of this country is now steering our vessels in every ocean to the east indies the northwest coasts of america and the extremities of the globe i have the best evidence that the scale of commerce so long against us is beginning to turn in our favor and that as a new thing in our new world the amount of exports from one state last year exceeded that of the imports more than two hundred and thirty thousand pounds what change in systems and amelioration in the general complexion of our affairs are likely to be produced in consequence of the national government     which is on the eve of being established i will not undertake to predict i hope and trust the ties which connect this nation with france will be strengthened and made durable by it in the mean time there are three things which i flatter myself will counterbalance on the side of the french commerce the three advantages of which i conceive the british merchants to be possessed the circumstances to which i allude are  st the increasing prejudices of this country against a commercial intercourse with england occasioned by provocations and augmented by impositions on her part  ndly the facility given in many instances by the french government for our making remittances in the staple commodities of this country and  dly the change of taste in favor of articles produced or manufactured in france which may indeed in a great degree be attributed to the affection and     gratitude still felt for her generous interposition in our favor i should be truly happy to learn that this country and its inhabitants have become agreeable to your excellency upon acquaintance for you may be assured sir no one can be more zealous than myself in promoting a friendly connexion between our nations or in rendering your situation perfectly satisfactory while the united states shall enjoy the benefit of your residence in them with the highest consideration and respect i have the honor to be c  george washington    august      mount vernon benjamin lincoln to benjamin lincoln mount vernon    august      my dear sir i received with your letter of the  th instant one from mr minot and also his history of the insurrections in massachusetts the work seems to be executed with ingenuity as well as to be calculated to place facts in a true point of view obviate the prejudices of those who are unacquainted with the circumstances and answer good purposes in respect to our government in general i have returned him my thanks for his present by this conveyance the public appears to be anxiously waiting for the decision of congress respecting the place for convening the national assembly under the new government and the ordinance for its organization methinks it is a great misfortune that local interests should involve themselves with federal concerns at this moment     so far as i am able to learn federal principles are gaining ground considerably the declaration of some of the most respectable characters in this state i mean of those who were opposed to the government is now explicit that they will give the constitution a fair chance by affording it all the support in their power even in pennsylvania the minority who were more violent than in any other place say they will only seek for amendments in the mode pointed out by the constitution itself i will however just mention by way of caveat there are suggestions that attempts will be made to procure the election of a number of antifederal characters to the first congress in order to embarrass the wheels of government and produce premature alterations in its constitution how these hints which have come through different channels may be well or illfounded i know not but it will be advisable i should think for the federalists to be on their guard so far as not to suffer any secret machinations to prevail without taking measures to frustrate them  that many amendments and explanations might and should take place i have no difficulty in conceding but i will confess my apprehension is that the new york circular letter is intended to bring on a general convention     at too early a period and in short by referring the subject to the legislatures to set every thing afloat again i wish i may be mistaken in imagining that there are persons who upon finding they could not carry their point by an open attack against the constitution have some sinister designs to be silently effected if possible but i trust in that providence which has saved us in six troubles yea in seven to rescue us again from any imminent though unseen dangers nothing however on our part ought to be left undone i conceive it to be of unspeakable importance that whatever there be of wisdom and prudence and patriotism on the continent should be concentred in the public councils at the first outset our habits of intimacy will render an apology unnecessary—heaven is my witnesss that an inextinguishable desire for the felicity of my country may be prompted is my only motive in making these observations i am c george washington    august      mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton mount vernon    august      dear sir i have had the pleasure to receive your letter dated the   th accompanied by one addressed to general morgan i will forward the letter to general morgan     by the first conveyance and add my particular wishes that he would comply with the request contained in it although i can scarcely imagine how the watch of a british officer killed within their lines should have fallen into his hands who was many miles distant from the scene of action yet if it so happened i flatter myself there will be no reluctance or delay in restoring it to the family as the perusal of the political papers under the signature of publius has afforded me great satisfaction i shall certainly consider them as claiming a most distinguished place in my library i have read every performance which has been printed on one side and the other of the great question lately agitated so far as i have been able to obtain them and without an unmeaning compliment i will say that i have seen no other so well calculated in my judgment to produce conviction on an unbiassed mind as the production of your triumvirate when the transient circumstances and fugitive performances which attended this crisis shall have disappeared that work will merit the notice of posterity because in it are candidly and ably discussed the principles of freedom and the topics of government which will be always interesting to mankind so long as they shall be connected in civil society the circular letter from your convention i presume was the equivalent by which you obtained an acquiescence in the proposed constitution notwithstanding i am not very well satisfied with the tendency of it yet the federal affairs had proceeded with few     exceptions in so good a train that i hope the political machine may be put in motion without much effort or hazard of miscarrying  on the delicate subject with which you conclude your letter i can say nothing because the event alluded to may never happen and because in case it should occur it would be a point of prudence to defer forming ones ultimate and irrevocable decision so long as new data might be afforded for one to act with the greater wisdom and propriety i would not wish to conceal my prevailing sentiment from you for you know me well enough my good sir to be persuaded that i am not guilty of affectation when i tell you that it is my great and sole desire to live and die in peace and retirement on my own farm were it even indispensable a different line of conduct     should be adopted while you and some others who are acquainted with my heart would acquit the world and posterity might possibly accuse me of inconsistency and ambition still i hope i shall always possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what i consider the most enviable of all titles the character of an honest man as well as prove what i desire to be considered in reality that i am with great sincerity and esteem dear sir c  george washington    august      mount vernon thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson mount vernon    august      sir i was very much gratified a little time ago by the receipt of your letter dated the  d of may you have my best thanks for the political information contained in it as well as for the satisfactory account of the canal of languedoc it gives me great pleasure to be made acquainted with the particulars of that stupendous work though i do not expect to derive any but speculative advantages from it when america will be able to embark in projects of such pecuniary extent i know not probably not for very many years to come but it will be a good example and not without its use if we can carry our     present undertakings happily into effect of this we have now the fairest prospect notwithstanding the real scarcity of money and the difficulty of collecting it the laborers employed by the potomac company have made very great progress in removing the obstructions at the shenandoah seneca and great falls insomuch that if this summer had not proved unusually rainy and if we could have had a favorable autumn the navigation might have been sufficiently opened though not completed for boats to have passed from fort cumberland to within nine miles of a shipping port by the first of january next there remains now no doubt of the practicability of the plan or that upon the ulterior operations being performed this will become the great avenue into the western country a country which is now settling in an extraordinarily rapid manner under uncommonly favorable circumstances and which promises to afford a capacious asylum for the poor and persecuted of the earth i do not pretend to judge how far the flames of war which are kindled in the north of europe may be scattered or how soon they will be extinguished the european politics have taken so strange a turn and the nations formerly allied have become so curiously severed that there are fewer sure premises for calculation than are usually afforded even on the precarious and doubtful subject but it appears probable to me that peace will either take place this year or hostility be greatly extended in the course of the next the want of a hearty coöperation between the     two imperial powers against the porte or the failure of success from any other cause may accelerate the first contingency the irritable state into which several of the other potentates seem to have been drawn may open the way to the second hitherto the event of the contest has proved different from the general expectation if in our speculations we might count upon discipline system and resources and certainly these are the articles which generally give decisive advantages in war i had thought full surely the turks must at least have been driven out of europe is it not unaccountable that the russians and germans combined are not able to effect so much as the former did alone in the late war but perhaps these things are all for the best and may afford room for pacification i am glad our commodore paul jones has got employment and heartily wish him success his new situation may possibly render his talents and services more useful to us at some future day i was unapprized of the circumstances which you mention that congress had once in contemplation to give him promotion they will doubtless judge now how far it may be expedient  by what we can learn from the late foreign gazettes affairs seem to have come nearly to a crisis in france and i hope they are beginning to meliorate should   0 the contest between the king and the parliaments result in a wellconstituted national assembly it must ultimately be a happy event for the kingdom but i fear that kingdom will not recover its reputation and influence with the dutch for a long time to come combinations appear also to be forming in other quarters it is reported by the last european accounts that england has actually entered into a treaty with russia and that the french ambassador at the court of london has asked to be informed of its tenor in whatever manner the nations of europe shall endeavor to keep up their prowess in war and their balance of power in peace it will be obviously our policy to cultivate tranquillity at home and abroad and to extend our agriculture and commerce as far as possible i am much obliged by the information you gave respecting the credit of different nations among the dutch moneyholders and fully accord with you with regard to the manner in which our own ought to be used i am strongly impressed with the expediency of establishing our national faith beyond imputation and of having recourse to loans only on critical occasions your proposal for transferring the whole foreign debt to holland is highly worthy of consideration i feel mortified that there should have been any just ground for the clamor of the foreign officers who served with us but after having received a quarter of their whole debt in specie and their interest in the same for some time they have infinitely less reason for complaint than our native officers of     whom the suffering and neglect have been only equalled by their patience and patriotism a great proportion of the officers and soldiers of the american army have been compelled by indigence to part with their securities for one eighth of the nominal value yet their conduct is very different from what you represented that of the french officers to have been the merits and defects of the proposed constitution have been largely and ably discussed for myself i was ready to have embraced any tolerable compromise that was competent to save us from impending ruin and i can say there are scarcely any of the amendments which have been suggested to which i have much objection except that which goes to the prevention of direct taxation and that i presume will be more strenuously advocated and insisted upon hereafter than any other i had indulged the expectation that the new government would enable those entrusted with its administration to do justice to the public creditors and retrieve the national character but if no means are to be employed but requisitions that expectation was vain and we may as well recur to the old confederation if the system can be put in operation without touching much the pockets of the people perhaps it may be done but in my judgment infinite circumspection and prudence are yet necessary in the experiment it is nearly impossible for anybody who has not been on the spot from any description to conceive what the delicacy and danger of our situation have been though the peril is not     past entirely thank god the prospect is somewhat brightening you will probably have heard before the receipt of this letter that the general government has been adopted by eleven states and that the actual congress have been prevented from issuing their ordinance for carrying it into execution in consequence of a dispute about the place at which the future congress shall meet it is probable that philadelphia or new york will soon be agreed upon i will just touch on the bright side of our national state before i conclude and we may perhaps rejoice that the people have been ripened by misfortune for the reception of a good government they are emerging from the gulf of dissipation and debt into which they had precipitated themselves at the close of the war economy and industry are evidently gaining ground not only agriculture but even manufactures are much more attended to than formerly notwithstanding the shackles under which our trade in general labors commerce to the east indies is prosecuted with considerable success salted provisions and other produce particularly from massachusetts have found an advantageous market there the voyages are so much shorter and the vessels are navigated at so much less expense that we may hope to rival and supply at least through the west indies some part of europe with commodities from thence this year the exports from massachusetts have amounted to a great deal more than their imports i wish this was the case everywhere        george washington    september      mount vernon henry lee to henry lee in congress mount vernon    september      dear sir your letter of the   th instant was of so friendly and confidential a complexion as to merit my early attention and cordial acknowledgments i am glad congress have at last decided upon an ordinance for carrying the new government into execution in my mind the place for the meeting of the new congress was not an object of such very important consequence but i greatly fear that the question entailed upon that body respecting their permanent residence will be pregnant with difficulty and danger god grant that true patriotism and a spirit of moderation may exclude a narrow locality and all ideas unfriendly to the union from every quarter your observations on the solemnity of the crisis and its application to myself bring before me subjects of the most momentous and interesting nature in our endeavors to establish a new general government the contest nationally considered seems not to have been so much for glory as existence it was for a long time doubtful whether we were to survive as an independent republic or decline from our federal dignity into insignificant and wretched fragments of an empire the adoption of the constitution so extensively and with so liberal an acquiescence on the part of the minorities in general promised the former until lately the circular letter of new york carried in my apprehension an unfavorable if not an insidious tendency to a contrary policy i still hope for the     best but before you mentioned it i could not help fearing it would serve as a standard to which the disaffected might resort it is now evidently the part of all honest men who are friends to the new constitution to endeavor to give it a chance to disclose its merits and defects by carrying it fairly into effect in the first instance for it is to be apprehended that by an attempt to obtain amendments before the experiment has been candidly made more is meant than meets the ear that an intention is concealed to accomplish slily what could not have been done openly to undo all that has been done if the fact so exists that a kind of combination is forming to stifle the government in embryo it is a happy circumstance that the design has become suspected preparations should be the sure attendant upon forewarning probably prudence wisdom and patriotism were never more essentially necessary than at the present moment and so far as it can be done in an irreproachably direct manner no effort ought to be left unessayed to procure the election of the best possible characters to the new congress on their harmony deliberation and decision every thing will depend i heartily wish mr madison was in our assembly as i think with you it is of unspeakable importance virginia should set out with her federal measures under right auspices the principal topic of your letter is to me a point of great delicacy indeed insomuch that i can scarcely without some impropriety touch upon it in the first place the event to which you allude may never happen     among other reasons because if the partiality of my fellow citizens conceive it to be a means by which the sinews of the new government would be strengthened it will of consequence be obnoxious to those who are in opposition to it many of whom unquestionably will be placed among the electors this consideration alone would supersede the expediency of announcing any definite and irrevocable resolution you are among the small number of those who know my invincible attachment to domestic life and that my sincerest wish is to continue in the enjoyment of it solely until my final hour but the world would be neither so well instructed nor so candidly disposed as to believe me uninfluenced by sinister motives in case any circumstance should render a deviation from the line of conduct i had prescribed to myself indispensable should the contingency you suggest take place and for arguments sake alone let me say it should my unfeigned reluctance to accept the office be overcome by a deference for the reasons and opinions of my friends might i not after the declarations i have made and heaven knows they were made in the sincerity of my heart in the judgment of the impartial world and of posterity be chargeable with levity and inconsistency if not with rashness and ambition nay farther would there not even be some apparent foundation for the two former charges now justice to myself and tranquillity of conscience require that i should act a part if not above imputation at least capable of vindication nor will you conceive me to     be too solicitous for reputation though i prize as i ought the good opinion of my fellow citizens yet if i know myself i would not seek or retain popularity at the expense of one social duty or moral virtue while doing what my conscience informed me was right as it respected my god my country and myself i could despise all the party clamor and unjust censure which must be expected from some whose personal enmity might be occasioned by their hostility to the government i am conscious that i fear alone to give any real occasion for obloquy and that i do not dread to meet with unmerited reproach and certain i am whensoever i shall be convinced the good of my country requires my reputation to be put in risk regard for my own fame will not come in competition with an object of so much magnitude if i declined the task it would lie upon quite another principle notwithstanding my advanced season of life my increasing fondness for agricultural amusements and my growing love of retirement augment and confirm my decided predilection for the character of a private citizen yet it would be no one of these motives nor the hazard to which my former reputation might be exposed nor the terror of encountering new fatigues and troubles that would deter me from an acceptance but a belief that some other person who had less pretence and less inclination to be excused could execute all the duties full as satisfactorily as myself to say more would be indiscreet as a disclosure of a refusal beforehand might incur the application of the fable in which the fox is represented     as undervaluing the grapes he could not reach you will perceive my dear sir by what is here observed and which you will be pleased to consider in the light of a confidential communication that my inclinations will dispose and decide me to remain as i am unless a clear and insurmountable conviction should be impressed on my mind that some very disagreeable consequences must in all human probability result from the indulgence of my wishes if you return by land i shall expect without failure the pleasure of your company i am much indebted to you for your obliging offer of forwarding such articles as i might want from new york though i shall not have occasion at this moment to avail myself of your goodness mrs washington offers her best compliments to mrs lee with ardent wishes for the reestablishment of her health which joined with my own will conclude me with great regard and esteem i am c george washington    september      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress mount vernon    september      my dear sir    upon mature reflection i think the reasons you offer in favor of philadelphia as the place for the first meeting of congress are conclusive especially when the farther agitation of the question respecting its permanent residence is taken into consideration but i cannot however avoid being satisfied that the minority should have acquiesced in any plan rather     than have prevented the system from being carried into effect the delay had already become the source of clamors and might have given advantages to the antifederalists their expedient will now probably be an attempt to procure the election of so many of their own junto under the new government as by the introduction of local and embarrassing disputes to impede or frustrate its operations in the mean time it behoves all the advocates of the constitution forgetting partial and smaller considerations to combine their exertions for collecting the wisdom and virtue of the continent to one centre in order that the republic may avail itself of the opportunity for escaping from anarchy division and the other great national calamities that impended to be shipwrecked in sight of the port would be the severest of all possible aggravations to our misery and i assure you i am under painful apprehensions from the single circumstance of mr h  having the whole game to play in the assembly of this state and the effect it may have in others should be counteracted if possible i am c george washington   october      mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton mount vernon   october      dear sir in acknowledging the receipt of your candid and kind letter by the last post little more is incumbent upon me than to thank you sincerely for the frankness with which you communicated your sentiments and     to assure you that the same manly tone of intercourse will always be more than barely welcome indeed it will be highly acceptable to me i am particularly glad in the present instance that you have dealt thus freely and like a friend  although i could not help observing from several publications and letters that my name had been sometimes spoken of and that it was possible the contingency which is the subject of your letter might happen yet i thought it best to maintain a guarded silence and to lack the counsel of my best friends   0 which i certainly hold in the highest estimation rather than to hazard an imputation unfriendly to the delicacy of my feelings for situated as i am i could hardly bring the question into the slightest discussion or ask an opinion even in the most confidential manner without betraying in my judgment some impropriety of conduct or without feeling an apprehension that a premature display of anxiety might be construed into a vainglorious desire of pushing myself into notice as a candidate now if i am not grossly deceived in myself i should unfeignedly rejoice in     case the electors by giving their votes in favor of some other person would save me from the dreaded dilemma of being forced to accept or refuse if that may not be i am in the next place earnestly desirous of searching out the truth and of knowing whether there does not exist a probability that the government would be just as happily and effectually carried into execution without my aid as with it i am truly solicitous to obtain all the previous information which the circumstances will afford and to determine when the determination can with propriety be no longer postponed according to the principles of right reason and the dictates of a clear conscience without too great a reference to the unforeseen consequences which may affect my person or reputation until that period i may fairly hold myself open to conviction though i allow your sentiments to have weight in them and i shall not pass by your arguments without giving them as dispassionate a consideration as i can possibly bestow upon them in taking a survey of the subject in whatever point of light i have been able to place it i will not suppress the acknowledgment my dear sir that i have always felt a kind of gloom upon my mind as often as i have been taught to expect i might and perhaps must ere long be called to make a decision you will i am well assured believe the assertion though i have little expectation it would gain credit from those who are less acquainted with me that if i should receive the appointment and if i should be prevailed upon to accept it the acceptance would be     attended with more diffidence and reluctance than i ever experienced before in my life it would be however with a fixed and sole determination of lending whatever assistance might be in my power to promote the public weal in hopes that at a convenient and early period my services might be dispensed with and that i might be permitted once more to retire to pass an unclouded evening after the stormy day of life in the bosom of domestic tranquillity but why these anticipations if the friends to the constitution conceive that my administering the government will be a means of its acceleration and strength is it not probable that the adversaries of it may entertain the same ideas and of course make it an object of opposition that many of this description will become electors i can have no doubt of any more than that their opposition will extend to any character who from whatever cause would be likely to thwart their measures it might be impolitic in them to make this declaration previous to the election but i shall be out in my conjectures if they do not act conformably thereto and from the seeming moderation by which they appear to be actuated at present is neither more nor less than a finesse to lull and deceive their plan of opposition is systematized and a regular intercourse i have much reason to believe between the leaders of it in the several states is formed to render it more effectual with sentiments of sincere regard and esteem i have the honor to be c      george washington    october      mount vernon benjamin lincoln to benjamin lincoln mount vernon    october      my dear sir i have been lately favored with the receipt of your letters of the   th and  0th of september with their enclosures and thank you sincerely for your free and friendly communications as the period is now rapidly approaching which must decide the fate of the new constitution as to the manner of its being carried into execution and probably as to its usefulness it is not wonderful that we should all feel an unusual degree of anxiety on the occasion i must acknowledge my fears have been greatly alarmed but still i am not without hopes from the good beginning that has been made in pennsylvania a state from which much was to be feared i cannot help foreboding well of the others that is to say i flatter myself a majority of them will appoint federal members to the several branches of the new government i     hardly should think that massachusetts connecticut new jersey delaware maryland south carolina and georgia would be for attempting premature amendments some of the rest may also in all probability be apprehensive of throwing our affairs into confusion by such illtimed expedients there will however be no room for the advocates of the constitution to relax in their exertions for if they should be lulled into security appointments of antifederal men may probably take place and the consequences which you so justly dread be realized our assembly is now in session it is represented to be rather antifederal but we have heard nothing of its doings mr patrick henry mr r h lee and mr madison are talked of for the senate perhaps as much opposition or in other words as great an effort for early amendments is to be apprehended from this state as from any but new york  the constant report is that north carolina will soon accede to the new union a new assembly is just     elected in maryland in which it is asserted the number of federalists greatly predominates and that being the case we may look for favorable appointments in spite of the rancor and activity of a few discontented and i may say apparently unprincipled men i would willingly pass over in silence that part of your letter in which you mention the persons who are candidates for the first two offices in the executive if i did not fear the omission might seem to betray a want of confidence motives of delicacy have prevented me hitherto from conversing or writing on this subject whenever i could avoid it with decency i may however with great sincerity and i believe without offending against modesty or propriety say to you that i most heartily wish the choice to which you allude may not fall upon me and that if it should i must reserve to myself the right of making up my final decision at the last moment when it can be brought into one view and when the expediency     or inexpediency of a refusal can be more judiciously determined than at present but be assured my dear sir if from any inducement i shall be persuaded ultimately to accept it will not be so far as i know my own heart from any of a private or personal nature every personal consideration conspires to rivet me if i may use the expression to retirement at my time of life and under my circumstances nothing in this world can ever draw me from it unless it be a conviction that the partiality of my countrymen had made my services absolutely necessary joined to a fear that my refusal might induce a belief that i preferred the conservation of my own reputation and private ease to the good of my country after all if i should conceive myself in a manner constrained to accept i call heaven to witness that this very act would be the greatest sacrifice of my personal feelings and wishes that ever i have been called upon to make it would be to forego repose and domestic     enjoyment for trouble perhaps for public obloquy for i should consider myself as entering upon an unexplored field enveloped on every side with clouds and darkness from this embarrassing situation i had naturally supposed that my declarations at the close of the war would have saved me and that my sincere intentions then publicly made known would have effectually precluded me for ever afterwards from being looked upon as a candidate for any office this hope as a last anchor of worldly happiness in old age i had still carefully preserved until the public papers and private letters from my correspondents in almost every quarter taught me to apprehend that i might soon be obliged to answer the question whether i would go again into public life or not you will see my dear sir from this train of reflections that i have lately had enough of my own perplexities to think of without adverting much to the affairs of others so much have i been otherwise occupied and so little agency did i wish to have in     electioneering that i have never entered into a single discussion with any person nor to the best of my recollection expressed a single sentiment orally or in writing respecting the appointment of a vicepresident from the extent and respectability of massachusetts it might reasonably be expected that he would be chosen from that state but having taken it for granted that the person selected for that important place would be a true federalist in that case i was altogether disposed to acquiesce in the prevailing sentiments of the electors without giving any unbecoming preference or incurring any unnecessary ill will since it here seems proper to touch a little more fully upon that point i will frankly give you my manner of thinking and what under certain circumstances would be my manner of acting for this purpose i must speak again hypothetically for arguments sake and say supposing i should be appointed to the administration and supposing i should accept it i most solemnly declare that whosoever shall be found to enjoy the confidence of the states so far as to be elected vicepresident cannot be disagreeable to me in that office and even if i had any predilection i flatter myself i possess patriotism enough to sacrifice it at the shrine of my country where it will be unavoidably necessary for me to have made infinitely greater sacrifices before i can find myself in the supposed predicament that is to say before i can be connected with others in any possible political relation in truth i believe that i have no prejudices on the subject and that it would     not be in the power of any evilminded persons who wished to disturb the harmony of those concerned in the government to infuse them into my mind for to continue the same hypothesis one step farther supposing myself to be connected in office with any gentleman of character i would most certainly treat him with perfect sincerity and the greatest candor in every respect i would give him my full confidence and use my utmost endeavors to coöperate with him in promoting and rendering permanent the national prosperity this should be my great my only aim under the fixed and irrevocable resolution of leaving to other hands the helm of the state as soon as my services could possibly with propriety be dispensed with i have thus my dear sir insensibly been led into a longer detail than i intended and have used more egotism than i could have wished for which i urge no other apology than but my opinion of your friendship discretion and candor i am c george washington    october      mount vernon mathew carey to mathew carey mount vernon    october      sir in reply to yours of the  0th of this month i have to observe that the fragment of the letter in question supposed to be written by me is spurious and that there was a pamphlet containing a great many letters of the same description published in new york at the same time it should farther be observed   0 that this publication was made soon after several of my letters were really intercepted with the mail and that the pretended copies of them not only blended many truths with many falsehoods but were evidently written by some person exceedingly well acquainted with my domestic and general concerns advantage was adroitly taken of this knowledge to give the greater appearance of probability to the fiction from these circumstances you will perceive sir how prudently you have acted in making an application to me previous to your meditated republication otherwise i might have found myself under the necessity of denying that they were genuine from any apprehension that being thus preserved in a manner under my eye and with my acquiescence they must have assumed the seal of veracity in the estimation of posterity for whatever credit some of those letters might be thought to have done to my literary or political talents i certainly cannot choose to avail myself of the imposition with due regard i am c george washington   december      mount vernon arthur young to arthur young mount vernon   december      sir i have been favored with the receipt of your letter dated the first day of july and have to express my thanks for the three additional volumes of the annals which have also come safely to hand     the more i am acquainted with agricultural affairs the better i am pleased with them insomuch that i can no where find so great satisfaction as in those innocent and useful pursuits in indulging these feelings i am led to reflect how much more delightful to the undebauched mind is the task of making improvements on the earth than all the vain glory that can be acquired from ravaging it by the most uninterrupted career of conquest the design of this observation is only to shew how much as a member of human society i feel myself obliged by your labors to render respectable and advantageous an employment which is more congenial to the natural dispositions of mankind than any other i am also much indebted to you for the inquiries you were so kind as to make respecting the threshing machines notwithstanding i am pretty well convinced from your account that the newinvented scotch machine is of superior merit to winlaws yet i think to wait a little longer before i procure one in the intermediate time i am not insensible to your obliging offers of executing this or any other commission for me and shall take the liberty to avail myself of them as occasions may require i would willingly have sent you a lock of the wool of my sheep agreeably to your desire but it is all wrought into cloth and i must therefore defer it until after the next shearing you may expect it by some future conveyance a manufacturer from leeds who was lately here judges it to be of about the same quality with the english wool in general—though     there is always a great difference in the fineness of different parts of the same fleece i cannot help thinking that increasing and improving our breed of sheep would be one of the most profitable speculations we could undertake especially in this part of the continent where we have so little winter that they require either no dry fodder or next to none and where we are sufficiently distant from the frontiers not to be troubled with wolves or other wild vermin which prevent the inhabitants there from keeping flocks though we do not feed our sheep upon leaves as you mention they do in some parts of france yet we cannot want for pastures enough suitable for them i am at a loss therefore to account for the disproportion between their value and that of black cattle as well as for our not augmenting the number so persuaded am i of the practicability and advantage of it that i have raised near  00 lambs upon my farm this year i am glad to find that you are likely to succeed in propagating the spanish breed of sheep in england and that the wool does not degenerate for the multiplication of useful animals is a common blessing to mankind i have a prospect of introducing into this country a very excellent race of animals also by means of the liberality of the king of spain one of the jacks which he was pleased to present to me the other perished at sea is about    hands high his body and limbs very large in proportion to his height and the mules which i have had from him appear to be extremely well formed for service i have likewise a     jack and two jennets from malta of a very good size which the marquis de lafayette sent to me the spanish jack seems calculated to breed for heavy slow draught and the others for the saddle or lighter carriages from these altogether i hope to secure a race of extraordinary goodness which will stock the country their longevity and cheap keeping will be circumstances much in their favor i am convinced from the little experiments i have made with the ordinary mules which perform as much labor with vastly less feeding than horses that those of a superior quality will be the best cattle we can employ for the harness and indeed in a few years i intend to drive no other in my carriage having appropriated for the sole purpose of breeding them upwards of twenty of my best mares since i wrote to you formerly respecting the objection made by my laborers to the weight of the ploughs i have had sufficient experience to overcome the illfounded prejudice and find them answer the purpose exceedingly well i have been laying out my farm into fields of nearly the same dimensions and assigning crops to each until the year      the building of a brick barn has occupied much of my attention this summer it is constructed according to the plan you had the goodness to send me but with some additions it is now i believe the largest and most convenient one in this country our seasons in this country or at least in this part of it have been so much in the two opposite extremes of dry and wet for the two summers past     that many of my experiments have failed to give a satisfactory result or i would have done myself the pleasure of transmitting it to you in the first part of last summer the rains prevailed beyond what has been known in the memory of man yet the crops in most parts of the united states are good they were much injured however in those places on my farm where the soil is mixed with clay and so stiff as to be liable to retain the moisture i planted a large quantity of potatoes of which only those that were put in as late as the end of june have produced tolerably well i am notwithstanding more and more convinced of the prodigious usefulness of this root and that it is very little if any thing of an exhauster i have a high opinion also of carrots the same unfavorableness of the season has rendered it unimportant to give a detail of my experiments this year in flax though i had sowed    bushels of the seed in some spots it has yielded well in others very indifferently much injured by weeds and lodgits as to what you suggest at the close of your letter respecting the publication of extracts from my correspondence in your annals i hardly know what to say i certainly highly approve the judicious execution of your wellconceived project of throwing light on a subject which may be more conducive than almost any other to the happiness of mankind on the one hand it seems scarcely generous or proper that any farmer who receives benefit from the facts contained in such publications should withhold his     mite of information from the general stock on the other hand i am afraid it might be imputed to me as a piece of ostentation if my name should appear in the work and surely it would not be discreet for me to run the hazard of incurring this imputation unless some good might probably result to society as some kind of compensation for it of this i am not a judge—i can only say for myself that i have endeavored in a state of tranquil retirement to keep myself as much from the eye of the world as i possibly could i have studiously avoided as much as was in my power to give any cause for illnatured or impertinent comments on my conduct and i should be very unhappy to have anything done on my behalf however distant in itself from impropriety which should give occasion for one officious tongue to use my name with indelicacy for i wish most devoutly to glide silently and unnoticed through the remainder of life this is my heartfelt wish and these are my undisguised feelings after having submitted them confidentially to you i have such a reliance upon your prudence as to leave it with you to do what you think upon a full consideration of the matter shall be wisest and best i am c george washington    december      mount vernon william gordon to william gordon mount vernon    december      dear sir your letter dated in london the   th of september has been duly forwarded to me by your friend mr hazard as i shall be able to notice the contents     but generally and briefly i request in the first place that you will be pleased to accept my best thanks for your good wishes for my happiness here and hereafter i am pleased to learn that your history is at length completed i conclude by the spring we may expect to be favored with a sight of it your mention of the several objects you judge of national consequence to the united states is to be esteemed among the tokens of your kind remembrance of america and regard to its interests how far i may ever be connected with its political affairs is altogether a matter of uncertainty to me my heartfelt wishes and i would fain hope the circumstances are opposed to it i flatter myself my countrymen are so fully persuaded of my desire to remain in private life that i am not without hopes and expectations of being left quietly to enjoy the repose in which i am at present or in all events should it be their wish as you suppose it will be for me to come again on the stage of public affairs—i certainly will decline it if the refusal can be made consistently with what i conceive to be the dictates of propriety and duty for the great searcher of human hearts knows there is no wish in mine beyond that of liberty and dying an honest man on my own farm i had quite forgotten the private transaction to which you allude nor could i recall it to mind without much difficulty if i now recollect rightly and i believe i do though there were several applications made to me i am conscious of only having done     my duty as no particular credit is due for that and as no good but some harm might result from the publication the letter in my judgment had better remain in concealment  the prospect that a good general government will in all human probability be soon established in america affords me more substantial satisfaction than i have ever before derived from any political event because there is a rational ground for believing that not only the happiness of my own countrymen but that of mankind in general will be promoted by it as it is really so long since i have had any occasion to make use of a cipher or key to communicate my sentiments to my correspondents and as it was so little probable i should ever have any occasion to express them by such modes in future i have absolutely mislaid or entirely lost yours with others besides i have not a single idea to communicate to any person while in europe the knowledge of which     could give any advantage to those who should be curious enough or mean enough to inspect my letters thus much i thought it might be well to say in apology for my not being able to comply with your request indeed when you consider the domestic walk of life in which i pass my days the multiplicity of private concerns in which i am involved the numerous literary applications from different quarters the round of company i have at my house and the avocations occasioned by my being at the head of the company for clearing the potomac you will do me the justice to suppose that i can have few topics or little time for correspondencies of mere friendship ceremony or speculation this i entreat may be accepted as the true reason why i am not able to write to you very fully or very regularly mrs washington joins with me in compliments to mrs gordon i remain c      george washington   january      mount vernon william pierce to william pierce mount vernon   january      sir as it would be altogether improper for me to anticipate any thing on the event which you suppose may happen i only write to let you know that i have duly received your letter of novr  st i most sincerely and fervently hope it will be found that i shall not be in a situation to have any agency in the disposal of federal appointments for you will permit me to say that the choice is as yet very far from     being certain and that should it contrary to all my wishes fall upon me i shall certainly be disposed to decline the acceptance if it may by any means be done consistently with the dictates of duty in this to me unpleasant state of affairs when i cannot but feel myself disagreeably affected by having the subject even obliquely forced upon my mind—you will be pleased to consider my studied reserve as not in the least intended to militate against your pretensions and as not having any reference in the remotest degree to an office for which i perceive there will be several competitors although i have thought it would ill become me at present to be more explicit with any person on public matters yet in all personal considerations i take a pleasure in subscribing myself with sentiments of great respect and esteem c    0 george washington    january      mount vernon marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette mount vernon    january      my dear marquis by the last post i was favored with the receipt of your letter dated the  th of september last notwithstanding the distance of its date it was peculiarly welcome to me for i had not in the mean time received any satisfactory advices respecting yourself or your country by that letter my mind was placed much more at its ease on both those subjects than it had been for many months the last letter which i had the pleasure of writing to you was forwarded by mr gouverneur morris since his departure from america nothing very material has occurred the minds of men however have not been in a stagnant state but patriotism instead of faction has generally agitated them it is not a matter of wonder that in proportion as we approach to the time fixed for the organization and operation of the new government their anxiety should have been increased rather than diminished     the choice of senators representatives and electors which excepting in that of the last description took place at different times in the different states has afforded abundant topics for domestic news since the beginning of autumn i need not enumerate the several particulars as i imagine you see most of them detailed in the american gazettes i will content myself with only saying that the elections have been hitherto vastly more favorable than we could have expected that federal sentiments seem to be growing with uncommon rapidity and that this increasing unanimity is not less indicative of the good disposition than the good sense of the americans did it not savor so much of partiality for my countrymen i might add that i cannot help flattering myself that the new congress on account of the selfcreated respectability and various talents of its members will not be inferior to any assembly in the world from these and some other circumstances i really entertain greater hopes that america will not finally disappoint the expectations of her friends than i have at almost any former period still however in such a fickle state of existence i would not be too sanguine in indulging myself with the contemplation of scenes of uninterrupted prosperity lest some unforeseen mischance or perverseness should occasion the greater mortification by blasting the enjoyment in the very bud i can say little or nothing new in consequence of the repetition of your opinion on the expediency there will be for my accepting the office to which     you refer your sentiments indeed coincide much more nearly with those of my other friends than with my own feelings in truth my difficulties increase and magnify as i draw towards the period when according to the common belief it will be necessary for me to give a definitive answer in one way or another should circumstances render it in a manner inevitably necessary to be in the affirmative be assured my dear sir i shall assume the task with the most unfeigned reluctance and with a real diffidence for which i shall probably receive no credit from the world if i know my own heart nothing short of a conviction of duty will induce me again to take an active part in public affairs and in that case if i can form a plan for my own conduct my endeavors shall be unremittingly exerted even at the hazard of former fame or present popularity to extricate my country from the embarrassments in which it is entangled through want of credit and to establish a general system of policy which if pursued will ensure permanent felicity to the commonwealth i think i see a path as clear and as direct as a ray of light which leads to the attainment of that object nothing but harmony honesty industry and frugality are necessary to make us a great and happy people happily the present posture of affairs and the prevailing disposition of my countrymen promise to coöperate in establishing those four great and essential pillars of public felicity what has been considered at the moment as a disadvantage will probably turn out for our good     while our commerce has been considerably curtailed for want of that extensive credit formerly given in europe and for default of remittance the useful arts have been almost imperceptibly pushed to a considerable degree of perfection though i would not force the introduction of manufactures by extravagant encouragements and to the prejudice of agriculture yet i conceive much might be done in that way by women children and others without taking one really necessary hand from tilling the earth certain it is great savings are already made in many articles of apparel furniture and consumption equally certain it is that no diminution in agriculture has taken place at the time when greater and more substantial improvements in manufactures were making than were ever before known in america in pennsylvania they have attended particularly to the fabrication of cotton cloths hats and all articles in leather in massachusetts they are establishing factories of duck cordage glass and several other extensive and useful branches the number of shoes made in one town and nails in another is incredible in that state and connecticut are also factories of superfine and other broadcloths i have been writing to our friend general knox this day to procure me homespun broadcloth of the hartford fabric to make a suit of clothes for myself i hope it will not be a great while before it will be unfashionable for a gentleman to appear in any other dress indeed we have already been too long subject to british prejudices i use no porter or cheese     in my family but such as is made in america both those articles may now be purchased of an excellent quality while you are quarrelling among yourselves in europe while one king is running mad and others acting as if they were already so by cutting the throats of the subjects of their neighbors i think you need not doubt my dear marquis we shall continue in tranquillity here and that population will be progressive so long as there shall continue to be so many easy means for obtaining a subsistence and so ample a field for the exertion of talents and industry all my family join in compliments to madame de lafayette and yourself adieu george washington    january      mount vernon benjamin lincoln to benjamin lincoln mount vernon    january      my dear sir your two letters of december  0th and january  th are before me  i am much obliged to you for the intelligence contained in them because it enabled me to contradict a report in circulation among the antifederalists that your state had made choice of     only one representative to congress that no more would probably be appointed and that every thing was in very great confusion though facts will ultimately become known yet much mischief to the federal cause may be done by suffering misrepresentation to pass unnoticed or unrefuted last winter the antifederalists in philadelphia published that connecticut had been surprised into an adoption of the constitution while a great majority of the freemen were opposed to it now it is certain nothing can fix the stigma of falsehood upon that assertion better than the late respectable appointments in that state much the same thing has happened in maryland the federal ticket has been carried by a majority of thousands in the county that bears my name there was not a dissenting vote by the best information i can obtain federal sentiments are spreading perhaps faster than ever in this commonwealth it is generally supposed that six if not seven of the representatives from it to congress will be decided friends to the constitution monday next will however confirm or contradict this opinion it being the day of election throughout the state i will only add that in maryland and this state it is probable mr john adams will have a considerable number of the votes of the electors some of those gentlemen will have been advised that this measure would be entirely agreeable to me and that i considered it to be the only certain way to prevent the election of an antifederalist with sentiments of the greatest esteem and regard i am c     george washington   february      mount vernon samuel powel to samuel powel mount vernon   february      dear sir the letters which you did me the honor of writing to me on the  th and   th last month came duly at hand and their enclosures were safely delivered to my nephew bushrod washington who has lately become a resident of alexandria where and at the courts in its vicinity he means to establish himself in the practise of the law no apology my dear sir on this or any other occasion was or will be necessary for putting any letter you may wish to have safely conveyed to a friend in these parts under cover to me all the political manœuvres which were calculated to impede if not to prevent the operation of the government are now brought to a close until the meeting of the new congress and although the issue of all the elections is not yet known they are sufficiently displayed to authorize a belief that the opposers of the government have been defeated in almost every instance although the elections in this state are over it will be some time from the extent of it before the representatives to congress can be finally announced from conjecture however it is supposed the majority will be federalists some are so sanguine as to believe that seven out of the ten will be so but this as i have already said is altogether conjecture and vague conjecture for much pains has been taken and no art left unessayed to poison the mind and alarm the fears of the people into opposition     on the list of the electors which has been published by the executive authority of the state there appear as far as i am acquainted with the character of the gentlemen eight decided friends to the new constitution be the cause of the british kings insanity what it may his situation if alive merits commiseration better perhaps would it have been for his nation though not for ours under present prospects if this event had happened at the time dr franklin you say supposes his majestys constitution was first tinged with the malady under which he is now laboring mrs washington the major and fanny and others under this roof unite in best wishes and affectionate regards for mrs powel george washington    february      mount vernon thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson mount vernon    february      dear sir having found that there is a vessel on the point of sailing from alexandria for havre de grace i would not forego so good an opportunity of addressing a letter to you although nothing very material has occurred since the date of my last which was transmitted by mr gouverneur morris as you will doubtless have seen in the gazettes the measures taken by the different states for carrying the new government into execution i will not therefore enter upon any report of news or discussion of political topics     exclusive of these things the greatest and most important objects of internal concern which at present occupy the attention of the public mind are manufactures and inland navigation many successful efforts in fabrics of different kinds are every day made those composed of cotton i think will be of the most immediate and extensive utility mr milne an english gentleman who has been many years introducing those manufactures into france and whose father is now carrying them on under the protection of government at the royal château of muette in passy has been at my house this week and is of opinion that they may be prosecuted in america to greater advantage than in france or england he has been almost two years in georgia stimulating and instructing the planters to the production of cotton in that state and south carolina it is said that cotton may be made of a most excellent quality and in such abundant quantities as to prove a more profitable species of agriculture than any other crop the increase of that raw material and the introduction of the late improved machines to abridge labor must be of almost infinite consequence to the prosperity of united america a desire of encouraging whatever is useful and economical seems now generally to prevail several capital artists in different branches have lately arrived in this country a factory of glass is established upon a large scale on monocacy river near fredericktown in maryland i am informed it will this year produce glass of various kinds nearly to the amount     of ten thousand pounds value this factory will be essentially benefited by having the navigation of the potomac completely opened but the total benefits of that navigation will not be confined to narrower limits than the extent of the whole western territory of the united states you have been made acquainted my dear sir with my ideas of the practicability importance and extent of that navigation as they have been occasionally though fully expressed in my several letters to you    notwithstanding my constant and utmost endeavors to obtain precise information respecting the nearest and best communication between the ohio and lake erie i am not yet able to add any thing more satisfactory to the observations which i had the honor to make on that subject in my letter of the  st of january      but i have lately received a correct draft executed principally from actual surveys of the country between the sources of the potomac and those navigable waters that fall into the ohio of this i enclose you such a rough sketch as my avocations would permit me to make my principal object therein being to show that the distance between the two waters is shorter and that the means of communication are easier than i had hitherto represented or imagined i need not describe what and how extensive the rivers are which will be thus in a wonderful manner connected as soon as the potomac shall be rendered entirely passable the passage would have been opened from fort cumberland to the great falls nine miles from   0 tidewater before this time as i mentioned in my letter of the   st of august last had it not been for the unfavorableness of the season in spite of that untoward circumstance i have the pleasure to inform you that two or three boats have actually arrived at the lastmentioned place i am going on monday next to visit the works as far as the seneca falls could i have delayed writing this letter until my return from thence and afterwards availed myself of the same conveyance i might have been more particular in my account of the state of the several works and especially of the situation of the land adjoining to the canal at the great falls whensoever the produce of those parts of the country bordering on the sources of the potomac and contiguous to the long rivers particularly the shenandoah and south branch that run into it shall be waterborne down to tidewater for exportation i conceive this place must become very valuable from the conveniency of the basin a little above the spot where the locks are to be placed and from the inducements which will be superadded by several fine millseats i cannot entertain a doubt of the establishment of a town in that place indeed mercantile people are desirous that the event should take place as soon as possible manufactures of various commodities and in iron particularly will doubtless be carried on to advantage there the millseats i well know have long been considered as very valuable ones how far buildings erected upon them may be exposed to injuries from freshets or the breaking up     of the ice i am not competent to determine from my own knowledge but the opinion of persons better acquainted with these matters than i am is that they may be rendered secure on the commodiousness of alexandria for carrying on the fur trade throughout the whole western country i treated in a very minute and i may say almost voluminous manner in my communication to you on the  0th of may      probably georgetown and the place which i have just mentioned will participate largely and happily in the great emoluments to be derived from that and other valuable articles through the inland navigation of the upper and western country i am dear sir yours c george washington   march      mount vernon harry innes to harry innes mount vernon   march      sir i have been favored by the receipt of your obliging letter dated the   th of december last just in time to send my acknowledgment by a person who is immediately returning to kentucky  this circumstance prevents me from expressing so fully as i     might otherwise have done the sense i have of the very patriotic sentiments you entertain respecting the important matter which is the subject of your letter as a friend to united america i embrace with extreme satisfaction the proposals you are pleased to offer of transmitting farther intelligence for which purpose i will endeavor to arrange and send you a cypher by the earliest safe conveyance in the mean time i rely implicitly upon that honor which you have pledged and those professions which you have made and sincerely hope that your activity and discretion will be successful in developing the machinations of all those who by sowing the seeds of disaffection may attempt to separate any portion of the united states from the union i will only add for myself i have little doubt but that     a perseverance in temperate measures and good dispositions will produce such a system of national policy as shall be mutually advantageous to all parts of the american republic i am sir with much esteem yours c george washington   march      mount vernon richard conway to captain richard conway mount vernon   march      dear sir never till within these two years have i ever experienced the want of money short crops and other causes not entirely within my controul make me feel it now very sensibly to collect money without the intervention of suits and these are tedious seems impracticable—and land which i have offered     for sale will not command cash at an undervalue if at all under this statement i am inclined to do what i never expected to be driven to that is to borrow money on interest five hundred pounds would enable me to discharge what i owe in alexandria c and to leave the state if it shall not be in my power to remain at home in retirement without doing this would be exceedingly disagreeable to me having thus fully and candidly explained myself permit me to ask if it is in your power to supply me with the above or a smaller sum any security you may best like i can give and you may be assured that it is no more my inclination than it can be yours to let it remain long unpaid could i get in one fourth part of what is due to me on bonds or sell any of the landed property which i am inclined to dispose of i could do it with ease but independently of these my rents and crops would soon enable me to do it provided i am tolerably successful in the latter and have common justice done me in the former your answer will much oblige yours c  george washington   march      mount vernon benjamin harrison to benjamin harrison mount vernon   march      my dear sir my friendship is not in the least lessened by the difference which has taken place in our political sentiments nor is my regard for you diminished by the     part you have acted mens minds are as variant as their faces and where the motives to their actions are pure the operation of the former is no more to be imputed to them as a crime than the appearance of the latter for both being the work of nature are equally unavoidable liberality and charity instead of clamor and misrepresentation which latter only serve to foment the passions without enlightening the understanding ought to govern in all disputes about matters of importance whether the former have appeared in some of the leaders of opposition the impartial world will decide according to report your individual endeavors to prevent inflammatory measures from being adopted redound greatly to your credit the reasons my dear sir why i have not written to you for a long time are two first because i found it an insupportable task to answer the letters which were written to me and at the same time to pay that attention to my private concerns which they required and there being lately little besides politics worthy of notice secondly because i did not incline to appear as a partisan in the interesting subject that has agitated the public mind since the date of my last letter to you for it was my sincere wish that the constitution which had been submitted to the people might after a fair and dispassionate investigation stand or fall according to its merits or demerits besides i found from disagreeable experience that almost all the sentiments extracted from me in     answer to private letters or communicated orally by some means or another found their way into the public gazettes as well as some other sentiments ascribed to me which never had an existence in my imagination in touching upon the more delicate part of your letter the communication of which fills me with real concern i will deal by you with all that frankness which is due to friendship and which i wish should be a characteristic feature in my conduct through life i will therefore declare to you that if it should be my inevitable fate to administer the government for heaven knows that no event can be less desired by me and that no earthly consideration short of so general a call together with a desire to reconcile contending parties as far as in me lies could again bring me into public life i will go to the chair under no preengagement of any kind or nature whatsoever but when in it i will to the best of my judgment discharge the duties of the office with that impartiality and zeal for the public good which ought never to suffer connections of blood or friendship to intermingle so as to have the least sway on decisions of a public nature i may err notwithstanding my most strenuous efforts to execute the difficult trust with fidelity and unexceptionably but my errors shall be of the head not of the heart for all recommendations for appointments so far as they may depend upon or come from me a due regard shall be had to the fitness of characters the pretensions of different candidates and so far as is proper     to political considerations these shall be invariably my governing motives  you will perceive then my dear sir that i cannot with propriety say any thing more on the subject than that several applications have been made to me for the office immediately in question without having received any answer i wish you had pursued the policy which the gentleman who now occupies it has     done of obtaining the appointment from the executive of this state although that gentleman was an officer yet he is quite unknown to me and therefore i cannot speak at all upon the ground of comparative claims of personal merits i conceive however it will be found no pleasant thing possibly very much the reverse to displace one man under these circumstances     of actual occupancy merely to make room for another however considerable his abilities or unimpeached his integrity may appear to the public eye  mrs washington joins me in every good wish for mrs harrison and your family i am sir c george washington    march      mount vernon george steptoe washington to george steptoe washington mount vernon    march      dear george as it is probable i shall soon be under the necessity of quitting this place and entering once more into the bustle of publick life in conformity to the voice of my country and the earnest entreaties of my friends however contrary it is to my own desires or inclinations i think it incumbent on me as your uncle and friend to give you some advisory hints which if properly attended to will i conceive be found very useful to you in regulating your conduct and giving you respectability not only at present but through every period of life you have now arrived to that age when you must quit the trifling amusements of a boy and assume the more dignified manners of a man at this crisis your conduct will attract the notice of those who are about you and as the first impressions   0 are generally the most lasting your doings now may mark the leading traits of your character through life it is therefore absolutely necessary if you mean to make any figure upon the stage that you should take the first steps right what these steps are and what general line is to be pursued to lay the foundation of an honorable and happy progress is the part of age and experience to point out this i shall do as far as in my power with the utmost chearfulness and i trust that your own good sense will shew you the necessity of following it the first and great object with you at present is to acquire by industry and application such knowledge as your situation enables you to obtain as will be useful to you in life in doing this two other important objects will be gained besides the acquisition of knowledge—namely a habit of industry and a disrelish of that profusion of money and dissipation of time which are ever attendant upon idleness i do not mean by a close application to your studies that you should never enter into those amusements which are suited to your age and station they may be made to go hand in hand with each other and used in their proper seasons will ever be found to be a mutual assistance to each other but what amusements are to be taken and when is the great matter to be attended to—your own judgement with the advice of your real friends who may have an opportunity of a personal intercourse with you can point out the particular manner in which you may best spend your moments of relaxation much better than i can at a     distance—one thing however i would strongly impress upon you viz that when you have leisure to go into company that it should always be of the best kind that the place you are in will afford by this means you will be constantly improving your manners and cultivating your mind while you are relaxing from your books and good company will always be found much less expensive than bad you cannot offer as an excuse for not using it that you cannot gain admission there or that you have not a proper attention paid you in it this is an apology made only by those whose manners are disgusting or whose character is exceptionable neither of which i hope will ever be said of you i cannot enjoin too strongly upon you a due observance of economy and frugality as you well know yourself the present state of your property and finances will not admit of any unnecessary expense the article of clothing is now one of the chief expenses you will incur and in this i fear you are not so economical as you should be decency and cleanliness will always be the first object in the dress of a judicious and sensible man a conformity to the prevailing fashion in a certain degree is necessary—but it does not follow from thence that a man should always get a new coat or other clothes upon every trifling change in the mode when perhaps he has two or three very good ones by him a person who is anxious to be a leader of the fashion or one of the first to follow it will certainly appear in the eyes of judicious men to have nothing better than a frequent change of dress to recommend him to notice     i would always wish you to appear sufficiently decent to entitle you to admission into any company where you may be—but i cannot too strongly enjoin it upon you—and your own knowledge must convince you of the truth of it—that you should be as little expensive in this respect as you properly can—you should always keep some clothes to wear to church or on particular occasions which should not be worn every day this can be done without any additional expense for whenever it is necessary to get new clothes those which have been kept for particular occasions will then come in as every day ones unless they should be of a superior quality to the new what i have said with respect to clothes will apply perhaps more pointedly to lawrence than to you—and as you are much older than he is and more capable of judging of the propriety of what i have here observed you must pay attention to him in this respect and see that he does not wear his clothes improperly or extravagantly much more might be said to you as a young man upon the necessity of paying due attention to the moral virtues—but this may perhaps more properly be the subject of a future letter when you are about to enter into the world if you comply with the advice herein given to pay a diligent attention to your studies and employ your time of relaxation in proper company you will find but few opportunities and little inclination while you continue at an acadimy to enter into those scenes of vice and dissipation which too often present themselves to youth in every place and particularly in towns if you are determined to     neglect your books and plunge into extravagance and dissipation nothing that i can now say would prevent it—for you must be employed and if it is not in pursuit of those things profitable it must be in pursuit of those which are — as your time of continuing with mr hanson expires the last of this month and i understand that doctor craik has expressed an inclination to take you and lawrence to board with him i shall know his determination respecting the matter—and if it is agreeable to him and mrs craik to take you i shall be pleased with it for i am certain that nothing will be wanting on their part to make your situation agreeable and useful to you should you live with the doctor i shall request him to take you both under his peculiar care—provide such clothes for you from time to time as he shall judge necessary—and do by you in the same manner as he would if you were his own children which if he will undertake i am sensible from knowledge which i have of him and the very amiable character and disposition of mrs craik that they will spare no proper exertions to make your situation pleasing and profitable to you should you or lawrence therefore behave in such a manner as to occasion any complaint being made to me you may depend upon losing that place which you now have in my affections and any future hope you may have from me but if on the contrary your conduct is such as to merit my regard you may always depend upon the warmest attachment and sincere regard of your affectionate friend and uncle     george washington  0 march      mount vernon james madison to james madison in congress mount vernon  0 march      my dear sir i have been favored with your letter of the   th by which it appears that a quorum of congress was hardly to be expected before the beginning of the next week as this delay must be very irksome to the attending members and every days continuance of it before the government is in operation will be more sensibly felt i am resolved that none shall proceed from me that can well be avoided after notice of the election is announced and therefore i take the liberty of requesting the favor of you to engage lodgings for me previous to my arrival mr lear who has lived with me three years as a private secretary will accompany or precede me in the stage and colonel humphreys i presume will be of my party on the subject of lodgings i will frankly declare to you that i mean to go into none but hired ones if these cannot be had tolerably convenient for i shall not be nice about them i would take rooms in the most decent tavern till a house can be provided for the more permanent reception of the president i have already declined a very polite and pressing invitation from the governor to lodge at his house till a place could be prepared for me after which should any other offer of a similar nature be made there could be no propriety in my acceptance of it as you are fully acquainted with my sentiments on this head i shall only add that as i mean to avoid private families on the one hand so on the     other i am not anxious to be placed early in a situation for entertaining for which reason private lodgings till i can feel the way a little would not only be more agreeable to my own wishes but possibly more consistent with sound policy  as it is my intention to conform to the public desire and expectation with respect to the style proper for the president to live in it may be well to know what these are before he enters upon it after all something may perhaps have been decided upon before this will reach you that may make the request nugatory if otherwise i will only in one word say that my wish is to be placed in an independent situation for the purpose i have mentioned i have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest regard c george washington    march      mount vernon thomas green to thomas green  mount vernon    march      thomas green i am about to leave my home whether for a length of time is more than i can tell at present—but be this as it may i expect the agreement to which we     have subscribed will be as strictly complied with on your part as it shall be punctually fulfilled on mine to enable you to do this you would do well to keep two things always in remembrance—first that all bargains are intended for the mutual benefit of and are equally binding on both the parties and are either binding in all their parts or are of no use at all—if then a man receives for his labor and he with holds that labor or if he trifles away that time for which he is paid it is a robbery—and a robbery of the worst kind because it is not only a fraud but a dishonorable unmanly and a deceitful fraud—but it is unnecessary to dwell on this because there is no man so ignorant of the common obligations of justice as not to know it—altho there are hundreds who do not scruple to practice it at the same time that they would think hard on the other hand if they were to be deprived of their money the other matter which i advise you to keep always in remembrance is the good name which common policy as well as common honesty makes it necessary for every workman who wishes to pass thro life with reputation and to secure employment having said thus much by way of exhortation i shall inform you in the most serious and positive terms that i have left strict orders with the major my nephew who is vested with full powers to transact all my business that if he should find you unfaithful to your engagements either from the love of liquor from a disposition to be running about or from proneness to idle when at your work—to discard you immediately and to remove your family from     their present abode the sure means to avoid this evil is—first to refrain from drink which is the source of all evil—and the ruin of half the workmen in this country—and next to avoid bad company which is the bane of good morals economy and industry you have every inducement to do this—reputation—the care and support of a growing family—and society which this family affords within your own doors which may not be the case with some of the idle to say nothing worse of them characters who may lead you into temptation were you to look back and had the means either from recollection or accounts to ascertain the cost of the liquor you have expended it would astonish you—in the manner this expence is generally incurred that is by getting a little now—a little then the impropriety of it is not seen in as much as it passes away without much thought but view it in the aggregate you will be convinced at once whether any man who depends upon the labor of his hands not only for his own support but that of an encreasing family can afford such a proportion of his wages to that article but the expence is not the worst consequence that attends it for it naturally leads a man into the company of those who encourage dissipation and idleness by which he is led by degrees to the perpetration of acts which may terminate in his ruin but supposing this not to happen a disordered frame and a body debilitated renders him unfit even if his mind was disposed to discharge the duties of his station with honor to himself or fidelity to his employer     from the execution of it an aching head and trembling limbs which are the inevitable effects of drinking disincline the hands from work hence begins sloth and that listlessness which end in idleness but which are no reasons for withholding that labor for which money is paid i have no other inducement for giving you this advice in this my hour of hurry but your own good for the wages and previleges which you have i well know would obtain for me the best workmen in this country without the charges of such a family as yours but as it has been a custom with me through life to give a preference to those who have long lived with me and my wish to see them do well i have taken the trouble of writing you this letter if you have gratitude or a mind capable of reflection it will make such an impression on it as may be serviceable to you thro life if not i have my labor for my pains whilst the negro carpenters work at the same spot where you are they will be subject to your inspection and orders—and at other times if it should be found necessary to put them under yr care it will be expected that you see that they do their duty i am c      george washington   april      mount vernon henry knox to henry knox mount vernon   april      dear sir the mail of the  0th brought me your favor of the   d by which and the regular information you have had the goodness to transmit to me of the state of things in new york i am very much obliged and thank you accordingly i feel for those members of the new congress who hitherto have given an unavailing attendance at the theatre of action for myself the delay may be compared to a reprieve for in confidence i tell you with the world it would obtain little credit that my movements to the chair of government will be accompanied by feelings not unlike those of a culprit who is going to the place of his execution so unwilling am i in the evening of a life nearly consumed in public cares to quit a peaceful abode for an ocean of difficulties without that competency of political skill abilities and inclination which are necessary to manage the helm i am sensible that i am embarking the voice of the   0 people and a good name of my own on this voyage but what returns will be made for them heaven alone can foretell integrity and firmness are all i can promise these be the voyage long or short shall never forsake me although i may be deserted by all men for of the consolations which are to be derived from these under any circumstances the world cannot deprive me i am c  george washington    april      mount vernon john langdon to john langdon mount vernon    april      sir i had the honor to receive your official communication by the hand of mr secretary thomson about one oclock this day having concluded to obey the important and flattering call of my country and having been impressed with an idea of the expediency of my being with congress at as early a period as possible i propose to commence my journey on thursday morning which will be the day after tomorrow i have the honor to be with sentiments of esteem sir c      inaugural speech to both houses of congress april  0th      fellowcitizens of the senate and house of representatives among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order and received on the   th day of the present month on the one hand i was summoned by my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love from a retreat which i had chosen with the fondest predilection and in my flattering hopes with an immutable decision as the asylum of my declining years a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time on the other hand the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications could not but overwhelm with despondence one who inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpractised in the duties of civil administration ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies in this conflict of emotions all i dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected all i dare hope is that if in executing this task i have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances or by an affectionate sensibility     to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellowcitizens and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me my     error will be palliated by the motives which misled me and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated     such being the impressions under which i have in obedience to the public summons repaired to the present station it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe who presides in the councils of nations and whose providential aids can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge in tendering this homage to the great author of every public and private good i assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own nor those of my fellowcitizens at large less than either no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the people of the united states every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted cannot be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage these reflections arising out of the present crisis have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed you will join with me i trust in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence by the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient the circumstances under which i now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject farther than to refer you to the great constitutional charter under which we are assembled and which in defining your powers designates the objects to which     your attention is to be given it will be more consistent with those circumstances and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me to substitute in place of a recommendation of particular measures the tribute that is due to the talents the rectitude and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them in these honorable qualifications i behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments no separate views or party animosities will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests so on another that the foundations of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality and the preeminence of a free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world i dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness between duty and advantage between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered as deeply perhaps as finally staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the american people besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the system or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject in which i could be guided by no lights derived from official     opportunities i shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good for i assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of a united and effective government or which ought to await the future lessons of experience a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be more impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted to the preceding observations i have one to add which will be most properly addressed to the house of representatives it concerns myself and will therefore be as brief as possible when i was first honored with a call into the service of my country then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties the light in which i contemplated my duty required that i should renounce every pecuniary compensation from this resolution i have in no instance departed and being still under the impressions which produced it i must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which i am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together i shall take my present leave but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favor the american people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquillity and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity on a form of government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views the temperate consultations and the wise measures on which the success of this government must depend     reply to the answer of the senate gentlemen i thank you for your address in which the most affectionate sentiments are expressed in the most obliging terms the coincidence of circumstances which led to this auspicious crisis the confidence reposed in me by my fellowcitizens and the assistance i may expect from counsels which will be dictated by an enlarged and liberal policy seem to presage a more prosperous issue to my administration than a diffidence of my abilities had taught me to anticipate i now feel myself inexpressibly happy in a belief that heaven which has done so much for our infant nation will not withdraw its providential influence before our political felicity shall have been completed and in a conviction that the senate will at all times cooperate in every measure which may tend to promote the welfare of this confederated republic thus supported by a firm trust in the great arbiter of the universe aided by the collected wisdom of the union and imploring the divine benediction on our joint exertions in the service of our country i readily engage with you in the arduous but pleasing task of attempting to make a nation happy reply to the answer of the house of representatives gentlemen your very affectionate address produces emotions which i know not how to express i feel that my past endeavors in the service of my country are far overpaid by its goodness and i fear much that my future ones may not fulfil your kind anticipation all that i can promise is that they will be invariably directed by an honest and an ardent zeal of this resource my heart assures me for all beyond i rely on the wisdom and patriotism of those with whom i am to cooperate and a continuance of the blessings of heaven on our beloved country      george washington   may      new york edward rutledge to edward rutledge new york   may      my dear sir i cannot fail of being much pleased with the friendly part you take in every thing which concerns me and particularly with the just scale on which you estimate this last great sacrifice which i consider myself as having made for the good of my country when i had judged upon the best appreciation i was able to form of the circumstances which related to myself that it was my duty to embark again on the tempestuous and uncertain ocean of public life i gave up all expectations of private happiness in this world you know my dear sir i had concentered all my schemes all my views all my wishes within the narrow circle of domestic enjoyment though i flatter myself the world will do me the justice to believe that at any time of life and in my circumstances nothing but a conviction of duty could have induced me to depart from my resolution of remaining in retirement yet i greatly apprehend that my countrymen will expect too much from me i fear if the     issue of public measures should not correspond with their sanguine expectations they will turn the extravagant and i may say undue praises which they are heaping upon me at this moment into equally extravagant though i will fondly hope unmerited censures so much is expected so many untoward circumstances may intervene in such a new and critical situation that i feel an insuperable diffidence in my own abilities—i feel in the execution of the duties of my arduous office how much i shall stand in need of the countenance and aid of every friend to myself of every friend to the revolution and of every lover of good government i thank you my dear sir for your affectionate expressions on this point i anticipate that one of the most difficult and delicate parts of the duty of my office will be that which relates to nominations for appointments i receive with the more satisfaction the strong testimonials in behalf of mr hall because i hope they will tend to supersede the difficulty in this instance though from a system which i have prescribed to myself i can say nothing decisive on particular appointments yet i may be allowed to observe in general that nothing could be more agreeable to me than to have one candidate brought forward for every office with such clear pretensions as to secure him against competition    0 mrs w is not here but is shortly expected on her arrival  i will offer the complts of mrs r  yourself to her in the meantime i pray you to believe that i am with sentiments of the purest esteem  the highest consideration c george washington    may      new york james madison to james madison new york    may      my dear sir to draw such a line for the conduct of the president as will please everybody i know is impossible but to mark out and follow one which by being consonant with reason will meet general approbation     may be as practicable as it is desirable the true medium i conceive must lie in pursuing such a course as will allow him time for all the official duties of his station this should be the primary object the next to avoid as much as may be the charge of superciliousness and seclusion from information by too much reserve and too great a withdraw of himself from company on the one hand and the inconveniences as well as a reduction of respectability from too free an intercourse and too much familiarity on the other under these impressions i have submitted the enclosed queries  for your consideration and would thank you for your sentiments thereon with the return of the paper for the remarks which it contains it is necessary that some plan should be adopted by the president for his mode of living that the pecuniary estimates for the department may have an eye thereto and though secondary it is a motive for my bringing the matter before you at this time i am your affectionate friend c queries   whether a line of conduct equally distant from an association with all kinds of company on the one hand and from a total seclusion from society on the other ought to be adopted by him and in that case how is it to be done   what will be the least exceptionable method of bringing any system which may be adopted on this subject before the public and into use   whether after a little time one day in every week will not be sufficient for receiving visits of compliment       whether it would tend to prompt impertinent applications and involve disagreeable consequences to have it known that the president will every morning at eight oclock be at leisure to give audience to persons who may have business with him   whether when it shall have been understood that the president is not to give general entertainments in the manner the presidents of congress have formerly done it will be practicable to draw such a line of discrimination in regard to persons as that six eight or ten official characters including in rotation the members of both houses of congress may be invited informally or otherwise to dine with him on the days fixed for receiving company without exciting clamors in the rest of the community   whether it would be satisfactory to the public for the president to make about four great entertainments in a year on such great occasions as the anniversary of the declaration of independence the alliance with france the peace with great britain the organization of the general government and whether arrangements of these two last kinds could be in danger of diverting too much of the presidents time from business or of producing the evils which it was intended to avoid by his living more recluse than the presidents of congress have heretofore lived   whether there would be any impropriety in the presidents making informal visits that is to say in his calling upon his acquaintances or public characters for the purpose of sociability or civility and what as to the form of doing it might evince these visits to have been made in his private character so as that they may not be construed into visits from the president of the united states and in what light would his appearance rarely at teaparties be considered   whether during the recess of congress it would not be advantageous to the interests of the union for the president to make the tour of the united states in order to become better acquainted with their principal characters and internal circumstances as well as to be more accessible to numbers of wellinformed persons who might give him useful information and advice on political subjects   if there is a probability that either of the arrangements may take place which will eventually cause additional expenses     whether it would not be proper that those ideas should come into contemplation at the time when congress shall make a permanent provision for the support of the executive remarks on the one side no augmentation can be effected in the pecuniary establishment which shall be made in the first instance for the support of the executive on the other all moneys destined to that purpose beyond the actual expenditures will be left in the treasury of the united states or sacredly applied to the promotion of some national objects many things which appear of little importance in themselves and at the beginning may have great and durable consequences from their having been established at the commencement of a new general government it will be much easier to commence the administration upon a welladjusted system built on tenable grounds than to correct errors or alter inconveniences after they shall have been confirmed by habit the president in all matters of business and etiquette can have no object but to demean himself in his public character in such a manner as to maintain the dignity of his office without subjecting himself to the imputation of superciliousness or unnecessary reserve under these impressions he asks for your candid and undisguised opinion george washington    may      new york mary wooster to mary wooster  new york    may      madam i have duly received your affecting letter dated the  th day of this month sympathizing with you as i do in the great misfortunes which have befallen your family in consequence of the war my feelings as an individual would forcibly prompt me to do every thing in my power to repair those misfortunes but as a     public man acting only with a reference to the public good i must be allowed to decide upon all points of my duty without consulting my private inclinations and wishes i must be permitted with the best lights i can obtain and upon a general view of characters and circumstances to nominate such persons alone to offices as in my judgment shall be the best qualified to discharge the functions of the departments to which they shall be appointed hitherto i have given no decisive answers to the applications of any candidates whatsoever nor would it be proper for me before offices shall be created and before i can have a general knowledge of the competitors for them to say any thing that might be construed as intended to encourage or discourage the hopes which individuals may have formed of success  i only wish so far as my agency in this business is concerned that candidates for offices would save     themselves the trouble and consequent expense of personal attendance all that i require is the name and such testimonials with respect to abilities integrity and fitness as it may be in the power of the several applicants to produce beyond this nothing with me is necessary or will be of any avail to them in my decisions in the mean time i beg you will be persuaded madam that let the result be whatsoever it may i can have no interest to promote but that of the public and that i remain in all personal considerations with the highest respect your most obedient servant george washington    may      new york count de moustier to count de moustier confidential new york    may      sir what circumstances there may be existing between our two nations to which you allude on account of     their peculiarity i know not but as those nations are happily connected in the strictest ties of amity not less by inclination and interest than by the solemnity of a treaty and as the united states are too remote from europe to take any share in the local politics of that continent i had concluded that commerce was the only subject of negotiations which could at present be very interesting to the inhabitants of the two countries in two letters which i had the pleasure of writing to you before i returned into public life i stated if i remember rightly for i have not the copies of the letters with me that i was so little acquainted with commercial affairs that i should very much distrust my own judgment even in the opinions which i might be obliged to hazard in treating casually of them this fact if there had been no other circumstance that merited a consideration would be a conclusive reason for preventing me individually from entering upon any kind of negotiations on that subject for while i find myself incompetent to it i really believe that much reciprocal advantage might be acquired if that subject could be candidly and intelligently managed this i should hope too might be the case and so far shall i be from throwing any obstacles in the way that i shall certainly take a great pleasure in removing so far as lays in my power such as may occur      every one who has any knowledge of my manner of acting in public life will be persuaded that i am not accustomed to impede the despatch or frustrate the success of business by a ceremonious attention to idle forms any person of that description will also be satisfied that i should not readily consent to lose one of the most important functions of my office for the sake of preserving an imaginary dignity but perhaps if there are rules of proceeding which have originated from the wisdom of statesmen and are sanctioned by the common consent of nations it would not be prudent for a young state to dispense with them altogether at least without some substantial cause for so doing i have myself been induced to think possibly from the habits of experience that in general the best mode of conducting negotiations the detail and progress of which might be liable to accidental mistakes or unintentional misrepresentations is by writing this mode if i was obliged myself to negotiate with any one i should still pursue i have however been taught to believe that there is in most polished nations a system established with regard to the foreign as well as the other great departments which from the utility the necessity and the reason of the thing provides that business should be digested and prepared by the heads of those departments the impossibility that one man should be able to perform all the great business of the state i take to have been the reason for instituting the great departments and appointing officers therein to assist the     supreme magistrate in discharging the duties of his trust and perhaps i may be allowed to say of myself that the supreme magistrate of no state can have a greater variety of important business to perform in person than i have at this moment very many things will doubtless occur to you sir as being incident to the office of president in the commencement of the government which cannot be done by the intervention of a third person you will give me leave to say likewise that no third person were there a disposition for it shall ever have it in his power to erect a wall between me and the diplomatic corps that is to say to prevent necessary communications nor has anybody insinuated that it would be beneath the dignity of a president of the united states occasionally to transact business with a foreign minister but in what light the public might view the establishment of a precedent for negotiating the business of a department without any agency of the head of the department who was appointed for that very purpose i do not at present pretend to determine nor whether a similar practice in that case must not of right be extended hereafter to all diplomatic characters of the same rank here you will be pleased to observe sir that i am writing as general washington to the count de moustier happy am i that my regard for yourself and your nation is so far from being equivocal that i have had several occasions of making it known to you both in conversation and writing and i hope you will consider this confidential letter as an evidence of     the extreme regret which i should feel in being obliged to decline any propositions as to the mode of doing business from a person who has so many titles to my esteem as the count de moustier i will only add that under my present impressions i cannot persuade myself that i should be justifiable in deviating essentially from established forms with the highest sentiments of esteem and regard i am sir c george washington    may      new york mathew carey to mathew carey new york    may      sir in the course of my whole existence i never before have been made the subject of such extraordinary conduct as that which i have been obliged to suffer by your sending to me unsealed through a public conveyance my letter of the   d and yours of the   th of this month after the candid and my heart witnessed for me no unfriendly part i had always acted towards you i hoped for the credit of human nature at least to have escaped an intentional insult i am c   00 george washington   june      new york to the secretary of foreign affairs  new york   june      sir although in the present unsettled state of the executive departments under the government of the union i do not conceive it expedient to call upon you for information officially yet i have supposed that some informal communications from the office of foreign affairs might neither be improper or unprofitable for finding myself at this moment less occupied with the duties of my office than i shall probably be at almost any time hereafter i am desirous of employing myself in obtaining an acquaintance with the real situation of the several great departments at the period of my acceding to the administration of the general government for this purpose i wish to receive in writing such a clear account of the department at the head of which you have been for some years past as may be sufficient without overburdening or confusing the mind which has very many  0  objects to claim its attention at the same instant to impress me with a full precise and distinct general idea of the affairs of the united states so far as they are comprehended in or connected with that department as i am now at leisure to inspect such papers and documents as may be necessary to be acted upon hereafter or as may be calculated to give me an insight into the business and duties of that department i have thought fit to address this notification to you accordingly i am c  george washington   july      new york james mchenry to james mchenry new york   july      dear sir i have received your very friendly letter of the   th of june and feel a grateful sense of the interest which you take in my welfare and happiness and the kind solicitude which you express for the recovery of my health i have now the pleasure to inform you that my health is restored but a feebleness still hangs upon me and i am yet much incommoded by the incision which was made in a very large and painful tumor on the protuberance of my thigh this prevents me from walking or sitting however the physicians assure me that it has had a happy effect in removing my fever and will tend very much to the establishment of my general health it is in a fair  0  way of healing and time and patience only are wanting to remove this evil i am able to take exercise in my coach by having it so contrived as to extend myself the full length of it i thank you my dear sir for the anxiety which you express that i should have some person about me who is well acquainted with my constitution and who has been accustomed to my confidence the habits of intimacy and friendship in which i have long lived with dr craik and the opinion i have of his professional knowledge would most certainly point him out as the man of my choice in all cases of sickness i am convinced of his sincere attachment to me and i should with cheerfulness trust my life in his hands but how far circumstances at present would justify his quitting his practice in alexandria and its vicinity to gratify his inclinations and my wishes i am not able to say but could it be made consistent with his advantage to be near me i am sure it would be highly pleasing to me i must however in justice to dr bard who has attended me during my late indisposition declare that neither skill nor attention has been wanting on his part and as i could not have the assistance of my good friend dr craik i think myself fortunate in having fallen into such good hands   0  you have my sincere wishes that your intended journey to the sweet springs may be the means of restoring the health of your brother and that it may be pleasant and healthful to yourself i am dear sir with very great esteem your affectionate c george washington    july      new york john jay to john jay private new york    july      dear sir i find myself incompetent to form any decided opinion upon the paper i received from you the other day without having a view of the transactions which have been had with the spanish minister i wish also to know whether if the negotiations are renewed it can be made to appear from any thing which that gentleman has said as the result of an advance towards it from him in his official character unless this is the case and primâ facie the reverse will it not convey to him and his court an idea that a change of sentiment has taken place in the governing powers of this country will it be expedient and proper at this moment for the president to encourage such an idea at any rate without previously advising with the senate with very sincere esteem and regard i am c  0  george washington    july      new york charles thomson to charles thomson new york    july      sir i have contemplated your note wherein after mentioning your having served in quality of secretary of congress from the first meeting of that body in      to the present time through an eventful period of almost fifteen years you announce your wish to retire to private life and i have to regret that the period of my coming again into public life should be exactly that in which you are about to retire from it the present age does so much justice to the unsullied reputation with which you have always conducted yourself in the execution of the duties of your office and posterity will find your name so honorably connected with the verification of such a multitude of astonishing facts that my single suffrage would add little to the illustration of your merits yet i cannot withhold any just testimonial in favor of so old so faithful and so able a public officer which might tend to soothe his mind in the shade of retirement accept then this serious declaration that your services have been important as your patriotism was distinguished and enjoy that best of all rewards the consciousness of having done your duty well you will be pleased sir to deliver the books records and papers of the late congress the great seal of the federal union and the seal of the admiralty to mr roger alden the late deputy secretary of congress who is requested to take charge of them  0  until farther directions shall be given i beg you to be persuaded that it will always afford me real pleasure to extend whatever encouragement may be consistent with my general duties to such particular persons as have long been faithful and useful servants to the community i finally commend you to the protection of heaven and sincerely wish you may enjoy every species of felicity i am c george washington    july      new york david stuart to david stuart new york    july      dear sir in the first moment of my ability to sit in an easy chair and that not entirely without pain i occupy myself in acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the   th instant and thanking you for it although my time before i was confined had been and probably now will be much more engaged yet your communications without any reserve will be exceedingly grateful and pleasing to me while the eyes of america perhaps of the world are turned to this government and many are watching the movements of all those who are concerned in its administration i should like to be informed through so good a medium of the public opinion of both men and measures and of none more than myself not so much of what may be thought commendable parts if any of my conduct as of those which are conceived to be of a different complexion the man who means to  0  commit no wrong will never be guilty of enormities consequently he can never be unwilling to learn what is ascribed to him as foibles if they are really such the knowledge of them in a welldisposed mind will go half way towards a reform if they are not errors he can explain and justify the motives of his actions at a distance from the theatre of action truth is not always related without embellishment and sometimes is entirely perverted from a misconception of the causes which produce the effects that are the subjects of censure   this leads me to think that a system which i found it indispensably necessary to adopt upon my first coming to this city might have undergone severe strictures and have had motives very foreign from those that govern me assigned as causes therefor i mean returning no visits   ly appointing certain days to receive them generally not to the exclusion however of visits on any other days under particular circumstances and  ly at first entertaining no company and afterwards until i was unable to entertain any at all confining it to official characters a few days evinced the necessity of the two first in so clear a point of view that had i not adopted it i should have been unable to have attended to any sort of business unless i had applied the hours allotted to rest and refreshment to this purpose for by the time i had done breakfast and thence till dinner and afterwards till bedtime i could not get relieved from the ceremony of one visit before i had to attend to another in a word i had no leisure to read or to  0  answer the despatches that were pouring in upon me from all quarters and with respect to the third matter i early received information through very respectable channels that the adoption thereof was not less essential than that of the other two if the president was to preserve the dignity and respect that was due to the first magistrate for that a contrary conduct had involved the late presidents of congress in insuperable difficulties and the office in this respect in perfect contempt for the table was considered as a public one and every person who could get introduced conceived that he had a right to be invited to it this although the table was always crowded and with mixed company and the president considered in no better light than as a maitre dhôtel was in its nature impracticable and as many offences given as if no table had been kept the citizens of this place were well knowing to this fact and the principal members of congress in both houses were so well convinced of the impropriety and degrading situation of their president that it was the general opinion that the president of the united states should neither give or receive invitations some from a belief independent of the circumstances i have mentioned that this was fundamentally right in order to acquire respect but to this i had two objections both powerful in my mind first the novelty of it i knew would be considered as an ostentatious show of mimicry of sovereignty and secondly that so great a seclusion would have stopped  0  the avenues to useful information from the many and make me more dependent on that of the few but to hit on a discriminating medium was found more difficult than it appeared to be at first view for if the citizens at large were begun upon no line could be drawn all of decent appearance would expect to be invited and i should have been plunged at once into the evil i was endeavoring to avoid upon the whole it was thought best to confine my invitations to official characters and strangers of distinction this line i have hitherto pursued whether it may be found best to adhere to or depart from it in some measure must be the result of experience and information so strongly had the citizens of this place imbibed an idea of the impropriety of my accepting invitations to dinner that i have not received one from any family though they are remarkable for hospitality and though i have received every civility and attention possible from them since i came to the city except dining with the governor on the day of my arrival so that if this should be adduced as an article of impeachment there can be least one good reason adduced for my not dining out to wit never having been asked to do so one of the gentlemen whose name is mentioned in your letter though hightoned has never i believe appeared with more than two horses in his carriage   0  but it is to be lamented that he and some others have stirred a question which has given rise to so much animadversion and which i confess has given me much uneasiness lest it should be supposed by some unacquainted with facts that the object they had in view was not displeasing to me the truth is the question was moved before i arrived without any privity or knowledge of it on my part and urged after i was apprized of it contrary to my opinion for i foresaw and predicted the reception it has met with and the use that would be made of it by the adversaries of the government happily the matter is now done with i hope never to be revived    0 the opposition of the senate to the discrimination in the tonnage bill was so adverse to my ideas of justice and policy that i should have suffered it to pass silently into a law without my signature had i not been assured by some members of the senate that they were preparing another bill which would answer the purpose more effectually without being liable to     the objections and to the consequences which they feared would have attended the descrimination which was proposed in the tonnage law why they keep their doors shut when acting in a legislative capacity i am unable to inform you unless it is because they think there is too much speaking to the gallery in the other house and business thereby retarded     your letter is the first intimation i ever received of any defect in the title or of any claim to the land called claiborns it is hardly to be conceived that philip whitehead claiborn who was brother and as you say executor to william claiborn for the payment of whose debts it was sold should have joined in the conveyance of land to which he himself had a right by entail admit this and bad motives must be ascribed to the action viz a knowledge that his son if the entail was good would not be barred by his conveyance if no act of assembly or writ of ad quod animum had previously docked it such a suspicion i cannot harbor of that gentleman because he possessed an exceeding fair character to the best of my recollection there are some papers in the garret at mount vernon which belong to the estate of mr custis in making a hasty arrangement of my own i came across and had them put into a trunk or box by themselves from a cursory inspection they appeared altogether unimportant or i should have sent them to you and in another trunk in my study there are papers which relate to my accounts and transactions with that estate possibly for it is not very probable you may find something in one or the other of those that may be useful if in the first i wish if they are deserving of the carriage that you would take them home the others may be necessary for my own security and therefore i would not have them removed the decree of king williams court will not i fear avail much for i do not conceive that it could extend if there was an entail in force beyond     the life of william claiborn if then living or that phil claiborns act could bind his son your trouble in this and the other disputes with mr custiss estate i perceive will be very great that your success may be correspondent i sincerely wish we shall be anxious after the decisions to learn the result i am mistaken greatly if i did not in the year      convey both the king william and the king and queen lands to mr custis by deeds executed at camp before colonels harrison mead and many others as witnesses to prove it in the general court and this in the presence of mr custis if it was not received for want of due proof i am ready to reacknowledge the same deed or a copy of it for i recollect pretty well taking the opinion of col harrison upon the nature of the conveyance—and if my memory has not failed me you will find some mention of the matter in one of my letters to mr custis which you called upon me some time ago to authenticate mr dandridge gave me an order upon mr brown of kentucky for £ 00 to be applied if received to the credit of mr custiss estate but the order was protested and mr dandridge had been advertised thereof nothing would give me more pleasure than to serve any of the descendants of general nelson of whose merits when living no man could entertain a higher opinion than i did at the same time i must confess there are few persons of whom i have no personal knowledge or good information that i would take into my family where many qualifications     are necessary to fit them for the duty of it to wit a good address abilities above mediocrity secrecy and prudence attention and industry good temper and a capacity and disposition to write correctly and well and to do it obligingly most clerkships will i presume either by law or custom be left to the appointment of their principals in office little expectation therefore could mr nelson or any stranger have from this source this latter consideration added to the desire i feel of serving the son of my old friend and acquaintance has induced me at all hazards to offer mr thomas nelson his son a place in my family i shall not trouble you with legislative or any other accounts which are detailed in the papers but that i have sent you the journals of the senate as far as they have been published and handed to me if the successor of mr richards would get the federal gazette published by fenno from this city it would enable him to collect as much information of what is passing on the theatre of new york as he could extract from all the other papers of the place and they are very numerous were he to go to the expense of them my best wishes attend mrs stuart and all the family and i am dear sir your affectionate friend and servant      george washington   august      new york james madison to james madison new york   august      my dear sir in consequence of the enclosed resolution i had a conference with the committee therein named yesterday when i expressed the sentiments which you also have enclosed i was assured by the committee that the only object the senate had in view was to be informed of the mode of communication which would be most agreeable to the president and that a perfect acquiescence would be yielded thereto but i could plainly perceive notwithstanding that oral communication was the point they aimed at indeed one of the gentlemen candidly declared that a great object with him in wishing this was to effect a viva voce vote in that body he added however that he was not without hopes of accomplishing this without to this i replied finding all three were opposed to the balloting system that nothing would sooner induce me to relinquish my mode of nomination by written messages than to accomplish this end thus the matter stands for my further consideration what do you think i had best do i am willing to pursue that line of conduct which shall appear to     be most conducive to the public good without regard to the indulgence of my inclination which i confess and for other reasons in addition to those which are enumerated although they are secondary would not be gratified by personal nominations  the period is now arrived when the seat of the vacant judge in the western district is to be filled would colonel carrington do you think be pleased with this appointment or are you acquainted with any professional character of fitness for the office south of new jersey that would accept it  i have had some conversation with mr jay     respecting his views to office which i will communicate to you at our first interview and this if perfectly convenient and agreeable to you may be this afternoon as i shall be at home and expect no company i am yours affectionately sentiments expressed by the president to the committee from the senate appointed to confer with him on the mode of communication between the president and the senate respecting treaties and nominations august  th      in all matters respecting treaties oral communications seem indispensably necessary because in these a variety of matters are contained all of which not only require consideration but some of them may undergo much discussion to do which by written communications would be tedious without being satisfactory oral communications may be proper also for discussing the propriety of sending representatives to foreign courts and ascertaining the grade or character in which they are to appear and may be so in other cases but it may be asked where are these oral communications to be made if in the senatechamber how are the president and vicepresident to be arranged the latter by the constitution being exofficio president of the senate would the vicepresident be disposed to give up the chair if not ought the president of the united states to be placed in an awkward situation when there these are matters which require previous consideration and adjustment for meetings in the senatechamber or elsewhere with respect to nominations my present ideas are that as they point to a single object unconnected in its nature with any other object they had best be made by written messages in this case the acts of the president and the acts of the senate will stand upon clear distinct and responsible ground     independently of this consideration it could be no pleasing thing i conceive for the president on the one hand to be present and hear the propriety of his nominations questioned nor for the senate on the other hand to be under the smallest restraint from his presence from the fullest and freest inquiry into the character of the person nominated the president in a situation like this would be reduced to one of two things either to be a silent witness of the decision by ballot if there are objections to the nomination or in justification thereof if he should think it right to support it by argument neither of which might be agreeable and the latter improper for as the president has a right to nominate without assigning his reasons so has the senate a right to dissent without giving theirs sentiments delivered by the president at a second conference with the committee of the senate august  0      the president has the power by and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties and to appoint officers the senate when this power is exercised is evidently a council only to the president however its concurrence may be to his acts it seems incident to this relation between them that not only the time but the place and manner of consultation should be with the president it is probable that the place may vary the indisposition or inclination of the president may require that the senate should be summoned to the presidents house whenever the government shall have buildings of its own an executive chamber will no doubt be provided where the senate will generally attend the president it is not impossible that the place may be made to depend in some degree on the nature of the business in the appointment to offices the agency of the senate is purely executive and they may be summoned to the president in treaties the agency is perhaps as much of a legislative nature and the business may possibly be referred to their deliberations in their legislative chamber the occasion for this distinction will be lessened if not destroyed when a chamber shall be appropriated for the joint business of the president and the senate     the manner of consultation may also vary the indisposition of the president may supersede the mere question of conveniency the inclination or ideas of different presidents may be different the opinions both of president and senators as to the proper manner may be changed by experience in some kinds of business it may be found best for the president to make his propositions orally and in person in others by a written message on some occasions it may be most convenient that the president should attend the deliberations and decisions on his propositions on others that he should not or that he should not attend the whole of the time in other cases again as in treaties of a complicated nature it may happen that he will send his propositions in writing and consult the senate in person after time shall have been allowed for consideration many other varieties may be suggested as to the mode by practice if these remarks be just it would seem not amiss that the senate should accommodate their rules to the uncertainty of the particular mode and place that may be preferred providing for the reception of either oral or written propositions and for giving their consent and advice in either the presence or absence of the president leaving him free to use the mode and place that may be found most eligible and accordant with other business which may be before him at the time    0 george washington august      james madison to james madison confidential august      the points which at present occur to me and on which i wish your aid are brought to view in the inclosed statement—i give you the trouble of receiving this evening that you may if other matter do not interfere suffer them to run through your mind between this and tomorrow afternoon when i shall expect to see you at the appointed time besides the enclosed would it do now that mr barton has declined the judges seat western territory to nominate col carrington for that office—if not can you think of any other that would suit him of new creation by this i mean which has not an actual occupant or some who from similarity of office may have better pretensions to it can you bring to mind any fit character for the vacancy just mentioned west of new jersey as virga has given and may furnish characters for important offices probably it would be better to exclude her also on this occasion what sort of a character in point of respectability and fitness for this office has maj george turner late of s carolina now of philadelphia  have you any knowledge of the character of mr lawrence—a practicing attorney and soninlaw to general st clair     what can i do with arthur lee he has applied to be nominated one of the associate judges but i cannot bring my mind to adopt the request the opinion entertained of him by those with whom i am most conversant is unpropitious and yet few men have received more marks of public favor and confidence than he has these contradictions are embarrassing should the sense of the senate be taken on the propriety of sending public characters abroad—say to england holland and portugal and of a day for thanksgiving would it be well to advise with them before the adjournment on the expediency and justice of demanding a surrender of our posts being clearly of opinion that there ought to be a difference in the wages of the members of the two branches of the legislature would it be politic or prudent in the president when the bill comes to him to send it back with his reasons for non concurring george washington    august      new york benjamin lincoln to benjamin lincoln new york    august      dear sir on the   th of september next there is to be a treaty held in the state of georgia between the indians on the southern frontiers and commissioners on the part of georgia at this treaty there will be a numerous and respectable concourse of indians two and some say three thousand their famous counsellor     the noted mcgillivray is to be present at it and it is now in agitation and a bill is before the house of representatives for that purpose to appoint commissioners on the part of the united states to attend at this treaty to establish a permanent and lasting peace between the united states and the indians on the southern  western frontiers—it is necessary in a matter of such importance to this country that these commissioners should be persons who have been known in public life and who are very respectable characters—and if to these two circumstances could be added their being held in high estimation in the southern states without being inhabitants of any of them it would be a very desirable thing—under these circumstances it is my wish that you should be one of these commissioners—and i have therefore given you this early intimation of the matter that you might if it should be determined to appoint commissioners and is agreeable to you and can be made to comport with your present office be making such arrangements as will enable you to be at new york and ready to embark for georgia on or before the first day of september and with an expectation of being absent   or   months you will make up your mind on this matter and give me an answer by the first post after you receive this as you see no time is to be lost for it is absolutely necessary that the commissioners should be on the spot the   th of september to prevent the enormous expense which would be incurred by detaining such a numerous body of indians for any time—in     the meantime you will keep this intimation to yourself for in the first place it is not certain that commissioners will be appointed—and if they should other circumstances might render a concealment of this intimation proper  i am my dear sir c     george washington   september      new york james craik to james craik new york   september      dear sir the letter with which you favored me on the   th ultimo came duly to hand and for the friendly sentiments contained in it you have my sincere and hearty thanks my disorder was of long and painful continuance and though now freed from the latter the wound given by the incision is not yet closed persuaded as i am that the case has been treated with skill and with as much tenderness as the nature of the complaint would admit yet i confess i often wished for your inspection of it during the paroxysm the distance rendered this impracticable and after the paroxysm had passed i had no conception of being confined to a lying posture on one side six weeks and that i should feel the remains of it more than twelve the part affected is now reduced to the size of a barleycorn and by saturday next which will complete the thirteenth week i expect it will be skinned over upon the whole i have more reason to be thankful that it is no worse than to repine at the confinement the want of regular exercise with the cares of office will i have no doubt hasten my departure for     that country from whence no traveller returns but a faithful discharge of whatsoever trust i accept as it ever has so it always will be the primary consideration in every transaction of my life be the consequences what they may mrs washington has i think better health than usual and the children are well and in the way of improvement i always expected that the gentleman whose name you have mentioned would mark his opposition to the new government with consistency pride on the one hand and want of manly candor on the other will not i am certain let him acknowledge an error in his opinions respecting it though conviction should flash on his mind as strongly as a ray of light if certain characters which you have also mentioned should tread blindfold in his steps it would be matter of no wonder to me they are in the habit of thinking that everything he says and does is right and if capable they will not judge for themselves it gives me pleasure to hear and i wish you to express it to them that my nephews george and lawrence washington are attentive to their studies and obedient to your orders and admonition that kind of learning which is to fit them for the most useful and necessary purposes of life among which writing well arithmetic and the less abstruse branches of the mathematics are certainly to be comprehended ought to be particularly attended to and it is my earnest wish that it should be so the gazettes are so full of the occurrences of public and indeed a private nature which happen in this     place that it is unnecessary if i had more leisure than falls to my lot to attempt a repetition i shall therefore refer you to them or to the alexandria paper through which they may if pains are taken be retailed mrs washington and the rest of the family join me in every good and friendly wish for mrs craik yourself and the rest of your family and with sentiments of sincere regard and friendship i am dear sir c george washington    september      new york betty lewis to mrs betty lewis new york    september      my dear sister colonel balls  letter gave me the first account of my mothers death  since that i have received mrs carters letter written at your request and previous to both i was prepared for the event by some advices of her illness communicated to your son robert awful and affecting as the death of a parent is there is consolation in knowing that heaven has spared ours to an age beyond which few attain and favored her with the full enjoyment of her mental faculties and as much bodily strength as usually falls to the lot of four score under these considerations and a hope that she is translated to a happier place it is the duty of her relatives to yield due submission to the decrees of the creator when i was last at fredericksburg i took a final leave of my mother never expecting to see her more     it will be impossible for me at this distance and circumstanced as i am to give the smallest attention to the execution of her will nor indeed is much required if as she directs no security should be given or appraisement made of her estate but that the same should be allotted to the devisees with as little trouble and delay as may be how far this is legal i know not mr mercer can and i have no doubt would readily advise you if asked which i wish you to do if the ceremony of inventorying appraising c can be dispensed with all the rest as the will declares that few or no debts are owing can be done with very little trouble every person may in that case immediately receive what is specifically devised the negroes who are engaged in the crops and under an overseer must remain i conceive on the plantation until the crop is finished which ought to be as soon as possible after which the horses stock of all sorts and every species of property not disposed of by the will the debts if any being first paid must by law be equally divided into five parts one of which you  another my brother charles and a third myself are entitled to the other two thirds fall to the share of the children of our deceased brothers samuel and john were it not that the specific legacies which are given to me by the will are meant and ought to be considered and received as mementos of parental affection in the last solemn act of life i should not be desirous of receiving or removing them but in     this point of view i set a value on them much beyond their intrinsic worth whilst it occurs to me it is necessary it should be known that there is a fellow belonging to that estate now at my house who never stayed elsewhere for which reason and because he has a family i should be glad to keep him he must i should conceive be far short in value of the fifth of the other negroes which will be to be divided but i shall be content to take him as my proportion of them—and if from a misconception either of the number or the value of these negroes it should be found that he is of greater value than falls to my lot i shall readily allow the difference in order that the fellow may be gratified as he never would consent to go from me debts if any are due should be paid from the sale of the crops plantation utensils horses and stock and the sooner an account is taken of the latter and they can conveniently be disposed of the better it will be for two reasons first because the overseer if he is not a very honest man may take advantage of circumstances and convert part of these things to his own use—and secondly because the season is now fast approaching when without feeding which would lessen the sale of the corn and fodder the stock will fall off and consequently sell to a disadvantage whether my mother has kept any accounts that can be understood is more than i am able to say—if any thing is owing to her it should be received—and if due from her paid after due proof thereof is made—she has had a great deal of money from me at times     as can be made appear by my books and the accounts of mr l washington during my absence—and over and above this has not only had all that was ever made from the plantation but got her provisions and every thing else she thought proper from thence in short to the best of my recollection i have never in my life received a copper from the estate—and have paid many hundred pounds first and last to her in cash—however i want no retribution—i conceived it to be a duty whenever she asked for money and i had it to furnish her notwithstanding she got all the crops or the amount of them and took every thing she wanted from the plantation for the support of her family horses c besides as the accounts for or against the estate must not only from the declaration in the will but from the nature of the case be very trifling and confined i should suppose to the town of fredericksburg it might be proper therefore in that paper to require in an advertisement all those who have any demands to bring them in properly attested immediately and those who are owing to pay forthwith the same advertisement might appoint a day for selling the stock and every thing excepting negroes at the plantation that is not devised by the will as it will be more convenient i should suppose for the heirs to receive their respective dividends of the money arising from the sales than to be troubled with receiving a cow a calf or such like things after the debts which must be the case have been first paid it might be well in fixing the day of sale to consult   0 the overseer to know when the business of the plantation will admit the cart team and utensils to be taken from it as the number of articles to be sold cannot be many and will be of small value i think they had better be sold for ready money and so advertised for though they would fetch more on credit there would more than probable be bad debts contracted and at any rate delay if not law suits before the money could be collected and besides if there are debts to be paid money will be wanted for the purpose and in no way can be so readily and properly obtained as by a ready money sale and from the crops if you think this business will be too troublesome for you with the aid of your sons—mr carter and colonel ball—who i am persuaded will give each of us assistance and you will let me know it i will desire major george washington to attend as the land at the littlefalls plantation goes to mr bushrod washington he should be apprised in time of the breaking of it up otherwise there may be injury to the houses and fencing if left without some person to attend to them have particular care taken of her papers the letters to her c i should prefer selling the houses and lotts on which my mother lived to renting of them—and would give a year or two years credit to the purchasers paying interest—and not being acquainted with the value of lotts in fredericksburg i would leave the price to any three indifferent and impartial gentleman to say what they are worth and that sum i will take     if they cannot be sold and soon i would rent them from year to year to any orderly tenant on a moderate rent if they are not disposed of on sale or by tennanting before the weather gets cool the paling will i expect be soon burnt up give my love to mrs carter and thank her for the letter she wrote to me i would have done this myself had i more time for private correspondences mrs washington joins in best wishes for her yourself and all other friends and i am with the most sincere regard your affectionate brother  george washington    september      new york benjamin franklin to benjamin franklin new york    september      dear sir the affectionate congratulations on the recovery of my health and the warm expressions of personal friendship which were contained in your letter of the   th instant claim my gratitude and the consideration that it was written when you were afflicted with a painful malady greatly increases my obligation for it      would to god my dear sir that i could congratulate you upon the removal of that excruciating pain under which you labor and that your existence might close with as much ease to yourself as its continuance has been beneficial to our country and useful to mankind or if the united wishes of a free people joined with the earnest prayers of every friend to science and humanity could relieve the body from pains or infirmities you could claim an exemption on this score but this cannot be and you have within yourself the only resource to which we can confidently apply for relief a philosophic mind if to be venerated for benevolence if to be admired for talents if to be esteemed for patriotism if to be beloved for philanthropy can gratify the human mind you must have the pleasing consolation to know that you have not lived in vain and i flatter myself that it will not be ranked among the least grateful occurrences of your life to be assured that so long as i retain my memory you will be thought on with respect veneration and affection by your sincere friend george washington    september      new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph new york    september      dear sir impressed with a conviction that the due administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good government i have considered the first arrangement of the     judicial department as essential to the happiness of our country and to the stability of its political system hence the selection of the fittest characters to expound the laws and dispense justice has been an invariable object of my anxious concern  i mean not to flatter when i say that considerations like these have ruled in the nomination of the attorneygeneral of the united states and that my private wishes would be highly gratified by your acceptance of the office i regarded the office as requiring those talents to conduct its important duties and that disposition to sacrifice to the public good which i believe you to possess and entertain in both instances i doubt not the event will justify the conclusion the appointment i hope will be accepted and its functions i am assured will be well performed notwithstanding the prevailing disposition to frugality the salary of this office appears to have been fixed at what it is from a belief that the station would confer preëminence on its possessor and procure for him a decided preference of professional employment as soon as the acts which are necessary accompaniments     of the appointment can be got ready you will receive official notice of the latter this letter is only to be considered as an early communication of my sentiment on this occasion and as a testimony of the sincere regard and esteem with which i am c  george washington    october      new york gouverneur morris to gouverneur morris new york    october      dear sir in my first moments of leisure i acknowledge the receipt of your several favors of the   d of february   of march and    of april to thank you for the interesting communications contained in those letters and for the pains you have taken to procure me a watch is all or nearly all i shall attempt in this letter for i could only repeat     things were i to set about it which i have reason to believe have been regularly communicated to you in detail at the periods which gave birth to them it may not however be unpleasing to you to hear in one word that the national government is organized and as far as my information goes to the satisfaction of all parties that opposition to it is either no more or hides its head that it is hoped and expected it will take strong root and that the nonacceding states will very soon become members of the union no doubt is entertained of north carolina nor would there be of rhode island had not the majority of that people bid adieu long since to every principle of honor common sense and honesty a material change however has taken place it is said at the late election of representatives and confident assurances are given from that circumstance of better dispositions in their legislature at its next session now about to be held the revolution which has been effected in france is of so wonderful a nature that the mind can hardly realize the fact if it ends as our last accounts to the first of august predict that nation will be the most powerful and happy in europe but i fear though it has gone triumphantly through the first paroxysm it is not the last it has to encounter before matters are finally settled in a word the revolution is of too great magnitude to be effected in so short a space and with the loss of so little blood the mortification of the king the intrigues of the queen and the discontent of the princes and the noblesse     will foment divisions if possible in the national assembly and they will unquestionably avail themselves of every faux pas in the formation of the constitution if they do not give a more open active opposition to these the licentiousness of the people on one hand and sanguinary punishments on the other will alarm the best disposed friends to the measure and contribute not a little to the overthrow of their object great temperance firmness and foresight are necessary in the movements of that body to forbear running from one extreme to another is no easy matter and should this be the case rocks and shelves not visible at present may wreck the vessel this letter is an evidence though of a trifling sort that in the commencement of any work one rarely sees the progress or end of it i declared to you in the beginning that i had little to say i have got beyond the second page and find i have a good deal to add but that no time or paper may be wasted in a useless preface i will come to the point will you then my good sir permit me to ask the favor of you to provide and send to me by the first ship bound to this place or philadelphia mirrors for a table with neat and fashionable but not expensive ornaments for them—such as will do credit to your taste—the mirrors will of course be in pieces that they may be adapted to the company the size of it i mean the aggregate length of them may be ten feet—the breadth two feet—the frames may be plated ware or any thing else more fashionable but not     more expensive if i am defective recur to what you have seen on mr robert morriss table for my ideas generally whether these things can be had on better terms and in a better style in paris than in london i will not undertake to decide i recollect however to have had plated ware from both places and those from the latter came cheapest—but a single instance is no evidence of a general fact of plated ware may be made i conceive handsome and useful coolers for wine at and after dinner those i am in need of viz eight double ones for madeira and claret the wines usually drank at dinner each of the apertures to be sufficient to contain a pint decanter with an allowance in the depth of it for ice at bottom so as to raise the neck of the decanter above the cooler—between the apertures a handle is to be placed by which these double coolers may with convenience be removed from one part of the table to another for the wine after dinner four quadruple coolers will be necessary each aperture of which to be of the size of a quart decanter or quart bottle for four sorts of wine—these decanters or bottles to have ice at bottom and to be elevated thereby as above—a central handle here also will be wanting—should my description be defective your imagination is fertile and on this i shall rely one idea however i must impress you with and that is in whole or part to avoid extravagance for extravagance would not comport with my own inclination nor with the example which ought to be set the reason why i prefer an aperture for every decanter or     bottle to coolers that would contain two and four is that whether full or empty the bottles will always stand upright and never be at variance with each other the letter enclosed with your draught accompanying it will provide the means for payment—the clumsy manner in which merchants or rather their tradesmen execute commissions where taste is required for persons at a distance must be my apology and the best that can be offered by— dear sir c george washington    october      new york thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson new york    october      dear sir in the selection of characters to fill the important offices of government in the united states i was naturally led to contemplate the talents and disposition which i knew you to possess and entertain for the service of your country and without being able to consult your inclination or to derive any knowledge of your intentions from your letters either to myself or to any other of your friends i was determined as well by motives of private regard as a conviction of public propriety to nominate you for the department of state which under its present organization involves many of the most interesting objects of the executive authority but grateful as your acceptance of this commission would be to me i am at the same time desirous to accommodate your wishes and i have therefore forborne to nominate     your successor at the court of versailles until i should be informed of your determination being on the eve of a journey through the eastern states with a view to observe the situation of the country and in a hope of perfectly reëstablishing my health which a series of indispositions has much impaired i have deemed it proper to make this communication of your appointment in order that you might lose no time should it be your wish to visit virginia during the recess of congress which will probably be the most convenient season both as it may respect your private concerns and the public service unwilling as i am to interfere in the direction of your choice of assistants i shall only take the liberty of observing to you that from warm recommendations which i have received in behalf of roger alden esquire assistant secretary to the late congress i have placed all the papers thereunto belonging under his care those papers which more properly appertain to the office of foreign affairs are under the superintendence of mr jay who has been so obliging as to continue his good offices and they are in the immediate charge of mr remsen with sentiments of very great esteem and regard i have the honor to be c    0 george washington    october      new york gouverneur morris to gouverneur morris new york    october      sir it being important to both countries that the treaty of peace between great britain and the united states should be observed and performed with perfect and mutual good faith and that a treaty of commerce should be concluded by them on principles of reciprocal advantage to both i wish to be ascertained of the sentiments and intentions of the court of london on these interesting subjects it appears to me most expedient to have these     inquiries made informally by a private agent and understanding that you will soon be in london i desire you in that capacity and on the authority and credit of this letter to converse with his britannic majestys ministers on these points namely whether there be any and what objections to performing those articles in the treaty which remain to be performed on his part and whether they incline to a treaty of commerce with the united states on any and what terms this communication ought regularly to be made to you by the secretary of state but that office not being at present filled my desire of avoiding delays induces me to make it under my own hand it is my wish to promote harmony and mutual satisfaction between the two countries and it would give me great pleasure to find that the result of your agency in the business now committed to you will conduce to that end i am sir yours c george washington    october      new york gouverneur morris to gouverneur morris new york    october      sir my letter to you herewith enclosed will give you the credence necessary to enable you to do the business which it commits to your management and which i am persuaded you will readily undertake your inquiries will commence by observing that as the present constitution of government and of the courts established in pursuance of it removes the objections heretofore made to putting the united states     in possession of their frontier posts it is natural to expect from the assurances of his majesty and the national good faith that no unnecessary delays will take place proceed then to press a speedy performance of the treaty respecting that object remind them of the article by which it was agreed that negroes belonging to our citizens should not be carried away and of the reasonableness of making compensation for them learn with precision if possible what they mean to do on this head the commerce between the two countries you well understand you are apprized of the sentiments and feelings of the united states on the present state of it and you doubtless have heard that in the late session of congress a very respectable number of both houses were inclined to a discrimination of duties unfavorable to britain and that it would have taken place but for conciliatory considerations and the probability that the late change in our government and circumstances would lead to more satisfactory arrangements request to be informed therefore whether they contemplate a treaty of commerce with the united states and on what principles or terms in general in treating this subject let it be strongly impressed on your mind that the privilege of carrying our productions in our vessels to their islands and of bringing in return the productions of those islands to our own ports and markets is regarded here as of the highest importance and you will be careful not to countenance any idea of our dispensing with it in a     treaty ascertain if possible their views on this point for it would not be expedient to commence negotiations without previously having good reasons to expect a satisfactory termination of them it may also be well for you to take a proper occasion of remarking that their omitting to send a minister here when the united states sent one to london did not make an agreeable impression on this country and request to know what would be their future conduct on similar occasions it is in my opinion very important that we avoid errors in our system of policy respecting great britain and this can only be done by forming a right judgment of their disposition and views hence you will perceive how interesting it is that you obtain the information in question and that the business be so managed as that it may receive every advantage which abilities address and delicacy can promise and afford i am sir yours c      george washington    october      weston john hancock to john hancock weston    october      sir i have this moment received your excellencys polite letter of today and have the honor to inform you that in consequence of suggestions made by the gentlemen from boston and the deputy adjutantgeneral whom i met at worcester this morning that it would make it more convenient for the troops many of whom lived at a distance from the place of parade if i should pass through cambridge at an earlier hour than i intended i thought it best to alter the time of my arrival at that place which i had the pleasure to mention to your excellency in my letter of yesterday and the alteration which i had made i immediately communicated to you by a letter which the gentlemen from boston were so kind as to take charge of but lest any accident should prevent that letter from getting to your hands i would here mention that it is my determination to be at cambridge tomorrow at ten oclock and from thence proceed to boston as soon as circumstances will permit where it is probable i may arrive by twelve oclock and i will do myself the honor to accept your excellencys polite invitation of taking an informal dinner with you i have the honor to be c      george washington    november      new york beverley randolph to beverley randolph governor of virginia new york    november      sir from the original letter which i forward herewith your excellency will comprehend the nature of a proposal for introducing and establishing the woollen manufactory in the state of virginia in the present stage of population and agriculture i do not pretend to determine how far that plan may be practicable and advisable or in case it should be deemed so     whether any or what public encouragement ought to be given to facilitate its execution i have however no doubt as to the good policy of increasing the number of sheep in every state by a little legislative encouragement the farmers of connecticut have in two years past added one hundred thousand to their former stock in my late tour through the eastern states i found that the manufacturers of woollens for the manufacture of woollens is carried on there to very considerable extent and advantage     preferred the wool raised in virginia for its fineness to that raised in more northern parts of the continent if a greater quantity of wool could be produced and if the hands which are often in a manner idle could be employed in manufacturing it a spirit of industry might be promoted a great diminution might be made in the annual expenses of individual families and the public would eventually be exceedingly benefited under these impressions i have thought proper to transmit the proposal and will only add that if it should be judged expedient to submit the subject to the legislature or if any private company should engage in promoting the business the necessity of keeping the manufacturers name concealed would undoubtedly occur as a premature knowledge of it might not only frustrate the success of the project but also subject the person principally concerned to the most distressing consequences i have the honor to be c george washington  0 november      new york james mchenry to james mchenry confidential new york  0 november      dear sir i have received your letter of the   th instant and in consequence of the suggestions contained therein added to other considerations which occurred to me i have thought it best to return judge robert hanson harrison his commission and i sincerely hope that upon a further consideration of the subject he     may be induced to revoke his former determination and accept the appointment  mr thomas johnson has likewise declined his appointment of district judge and i have no information of mr richard potts the attorney or mr nathaniel ramsay the marshal having accepted their commissions thus circumstanced with respect to maryland i am unwilling to make a new appointment of judge for that district until i can have an assurance or at least a strong presumption that the person appointed will accept for it is to me an unpleasant thing to have commissions of such high importance returned and it will in fact have a tendency to bring the government into discredit mr alexander contee hanson is the person whom i now have it in contemplation to bring forward as district judge of maryland and shall do so provided i can obtain an assurance that such an appointment would be acceptable to him but as i cannot take any direct measures to draw from him a sentiment on this head i must request my dear sir that you will be so good as to get for me if you can such information upon the subject as will enable me to act with confidence in it and convey the same to me as soon as possible i shall leave to your prudence and discretion the mode of gaining this knowledge it is a delicate matter and will not bear any thing like a direct application if there is the least cause to apprehend a refusal i have observed in the papers that mr hanson has been appointed chancellor     of the state since the death of mr john rogers what the emoluments of this office are or its tenure i know not therefore can form no opinion how far it may operate in this matter mr johnsons resignation came to hand too late to admit of a new appointment and information to be given of it before the time fixed by the act for holding the first district court in maryland however if this had not been the case i should hardly have hazarded a new appointment for the reasons before mentioned until i had good grounds to believe it would be accepted should it be found that the office of district judge would not be acceptable to mr hanson mr paca has been mentioned for that appointment and although his sentiments have not been altogether in favor of the general government and a little adverse on the score of paper emissions i do not know but his appointment on some other accounts might be a proper thing however this will come more fully under consideration if mr hanson should not wish to be brought forward and in that case i will thank you to give me information relative to mr paca    0 mr gustavus scott and mr robert smith of baltimore have also been mentioned for the office but the age and inexperience of the latter is in my opinion an insuperable objection for however good the qualifications or promising the talents of mr smith may be it will be expected that the important offices of the general government and more especially those of the judges should be filled by men who have been tried and proved i thank you my good sir for your kind wishes for my health and happiness and reciprocate them with sincerity with very great regard i am c george washington  0 november      new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph new york  0 november      dear sir your letter of the  th of october gave me pleasure as i not only entertain hopes but shall fully expect from the contents of it to see you in the office of attorneygeneral when the purposes mentioned by you for the delay are answered i shall now mention some matters to you in confidence mr pendletons declining to accept the appointment of district judge has embarrassed me and this embarrassment was not a little increased by the     lateness of the period at which being on a tour through the eastern states i came to the knowledge of it when i was about to make the nominations in the judiciary for the union the character and abilities of mr wythe did not escape me and i accordingly consulted such gentlemen from the state of virginia then in this city as i thought most likely to have some knowledge of his inclinations their opinion was that as he had lately been appointed sole chancellor an office to which by inclination he was led and engaged in other avocations which engrossed his attention and appeared to afford him pleasure he would not exchange the former for a federal appointment however since these appointments have been announced i have heard that it has been the wonder of some in virginia that mr wythe should have been overlooked the cause if the epithet applies i have assigned and if there was reason to apprehend a refusal in the first instance the nonacceptance of colonel pendleton would be no inducement to him to come forward in the second to consult him through the medium of a friend there was not time as the third tuesday in december is the day appointed for holding the district court in the district of virginia and to hazard a second refusal i was on many accounts unwilling to do under these circumstances i have by the powers of the constitution appointed mr cyrus griffin during the recess of the senate my reasons for this appointment in preference to any other except mr wythe are because he has     as i am informed been regularly bred to the law has been in the court of appeals has been discontinued of the council in virginia contrary to the expectation of his friends here at the time who thought that his temporary appointment as a negotiator with the southern indians would not bring him under the disqualifying law of virginia and thereby thrown entirely out of employment and because i had it in my power to ascertain with precision his acceptance i shall say nothing of his being a man of amiable character and of competent abilities because in these respects some of the present judges in that state may be his equals but to what i have said may be added he has no employment now and needs the emolument of one as much as any of them i will not conceal from you that two motives have induced me to give this explanation the first if a favorable opportunity should present itself is that mr wythe may in a delicate manner be informed of the principles by which i was governed in this business the second that my inducements to appoint mr griffin may not if the propriety of it should be questioned be altogether unknown for having in every appointment endeavored as far as my own knowledge of characters extended or information could be obtained to select the fittest and most acceptable persons and having reason to believe that the appointments which have been made heretofore have given very general satisfaction it would give me pain if mr wythe or any     of his friends should conceive that he has been passed by from improper motives i have prejudices against none nor partialities which shall bias me in favor of any one if i err then my errors will be of the head and not of the heart of my dear sir your most obedient c  george washington    december      new york alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton secretary of the treasury new york    december      sir as i am uncertain of the condition and even the office in which the papers containing accounts of our disbursements for subsistence of british prisoners remain and as it is not improbable that some negotiations may whenever our union under the general government shall be completed take place between the united states and great britain in which an accurate understanding of those accounts will become necessary i have therefore thot proper to suggest the expediency of having some immediate attention paid to them notwithstanding on as fair a statement of expenditures     as could now be made much property must undoubtedly be lost by the united states for want of vouchers and by reason of the negligence with which the business was conducted on our part yet i was always impressed with an idea that under all these disadvantageous circumstances a very considerable balance would still be found in our favor my present wish is to have the subject so far investigated as that we might not commit ourselves by bringing forward accounts which had better continue dormant shoud there be no danger of that kind it would then be desirable to have the business placed in a state which might enable us to speak from a general knowledge of facts and in a proper tone in case a demand of the american posts held by the king of great britain should draw pecuniary subjects into discussion i believe lists of property carried away by the british at the time when they evacuated the posts they had occupied during the late war are lodged in the office of foreign affairs i am sir c george washington    december      new york jabez bowen to jabez bowen new york    december      sir the letters with which you have been pleased to favor me dated in october and the   th of the present month came duly to hand and are entitled to my thanks for the communications contained in them as it is possible the conduct of rhode island if persevered     in may involve questions in congress which will call for my official decisions it is not fit that i should express more than a wish in reply to your letter that the legislature at the coming session would consider well before it again rejects the proposition for calling a convention to decide on their accession to or rejection of the present government the adoption of it by north carolina has left them entirely alone  i am much obliged to you for your good wishes and with esteem and regard i am sir c        0 speech to both houses of congress january  th    0 fellowcitizens of the senate and house of representatives i embrace with great satisfaction the opportunity which now presents itself of congratulating you on the present favorable prospects of our public affairs the recent accession of the important state of north carolina to the constitution of the united states of which official information has been received the rising credit and respectability of our country and the general and increasing good will towards the government of the union and the concord peace and plenty with which we are blessed are circumstances auspicious in an eminent degree to our national prosperity in resuming your consultations for the general good you cannot but derive encouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last session have been as satisfactory to your constituents as the novelty and difficulty of the work allowed you to hope still further to realize their expectations and to secure the blessings which a gracious providence has placed within our reach will in the course of the present important session call for the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism firmness and wisdom among the many interesting objects which will engage your attention that of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace a free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined to which end a uniform and welldigested plan is requisite and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent on others for essential particularly for military supplies     the proper establishment of the troops which may be deemed indispensable will be entitled to mature consideration in the arrangements which may be made respecting it it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable support of the officers and soldiers with a due regard to economy there was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard to certain hostile tribes of indians would have relieved the inhabitants of our southern and western frontiers from their depredations but you will perceive from the information contained in the papers which i shall direct to be laid before you comprehending a communication from the commonwealth of virginia that we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the union and if necessary to punish aggressors the interest of the united states requires that our intercourse with other nations should be facilitated by such provisions as will enable me to fulfil my duty in that respect in the manner which circumstances may render most conducive to the public good and to this end that the compensations to be made to the persons who may be employed should according to the nature of their appointments be defined by law and a competent fund designated for defraying the expenses incident to the conduct of our foreign affairs various considerations also render it expedient that the terms on which foreigners may be admitted to the rights of citizens should be speedily ascertained by a uniform rule of naturalization uniformity in the currency weights and measures of the united states is an object of great importance and will i am persuaded be duly attended to the advancement of agriculture commerce and manufactures by all proper means will not i trust need recommendation but i cannot forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad as to the exertions of skill and genius in producing them at home and of facilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our country by a due attention to the postoffice and postroads nor am i less persuaded that you will agree with me in opinion that there is nothing which can better deserve your patronage     than the promotion of science and literature knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness in one in which the measures of government receive their impression so immediately from the sense of the community as in ours it is proportionably essential to the security of a free constitution it contributes in various ways by convincing those who are intrusted with the public administration that every valuable end of government is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people and by teaching the people themselves to know and to value their own rights to discern and provide against invasions of them to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of lawful authority between burthens proceeding from a disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of society to discriminate the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness cherishing the first avoiding the last and uniting a speedy but temperate vigilance against encroachments with an inviolable respect to the laws whether this desirable object will be the best promoted by affording aids to seminaries of learning already established by the institution of a national university or by any other expedients will be well worthy of a place in the deliberations of the legislature gentlemen of the house of representatives i saw with peculiar pleasure at the close of the last session the resolution entered into by you expressive of your opinion that an adequate provision for the support of the public credit is a matter of high importance to the national honor and prosperity in this sentiment i entirely concur and to a perfect confidence in your best endeavors to devise such a provision as will be truly consistent with the end i add an equal reliance on the cheerful cooperation of the other branch of the legislature it would be superfluous to specify inducements to a measure in which the character and permanent interests of the united states are so obviously and so deeply concerned and which has received so explicit a sanction from your declaration     gentlemen of the senate and house of representatives i have directed the proper officers to lay before you respectively such papers and estimates as regard the affairs particularly recommended to your consideration and necessary to convey to you that information of the state of the union which it is my duty to afford the welfare of our country is the great object to which our cares and efforts ought to be directed and i shall derive great satisfaction from a cooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring to our fellowcitizens the blessings which they have a right to expect from a free efficient and equal government george washington   january    0 new york catharine macaulay graham to catharine macaulay graham new york   january    0 madam your obliging letter dated in october last has been received and as i do not know when i shall have more leisure than at present to throw together a few observations in return for yours i take up my pen to do it by this early occasion in the first place i thank you for your congratulatory sentiments on the event which has placed me at the head of the american government as well as for the indulgent partiality which it is to be feared however may have warped your judgment too much in my favor but you do me no more than justice in supposing that if i had been permitted to indulge my first and fondest wish i should have remained in a private station although neither the present age nor posterity may possibly give me full credit for the feelings which   0 i have experienced on this subject yet i have a consciousness that nothing short of an absolute conviction of duty could ever have brought me upon the scenes of public life again the establishment of our new government seemed to be the last great experiment for promoting human happiness by a reasonable compact in civil society it was to be in the first instance in a considerable degree a government of accommodation as well as a government of laws much was to be done by prudence much by conciliation much by firmness few who are not philosophical spectators can realize the difficult and delicate part which a man in my situation had to act all see and most admire the glare which hovers round the external happiness of elevated office to me there is nothing in it beyond the lustre which may be reflected from its connexion with a power of promoting human felicity in our progress towards political happiness my station is new and if i may use the expression i walk on untrodden ground there is scarcely an action the motive to which may not be subject to a double interpretation there is scarcely any part of my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent under such a view of the duties inherent to my arduous office i could not but feel a diffidence in myself on the one hand and an anxiety for the community that every new arrangement should be made in the best possible manner on the other if after all my humble but faithful endeavors to advance the felicity of my country and mankind i may indulge a     hope that my labors have not been altogether without success it will be the only real compensation i can receive in the closing scenes of life on the actual situation of this country under its new government i will in the next place make a few remarks that the government though not actually perfect is one of the best in the world i have little doubt i always believed that an unequivocally free and equal representation of the people in the legislature together with an efficient and responsible executive were the great pillars on which the preservation of american freedom must depend it was indeed next to a miracle that there should have been so much unanimity in points of such importance among such a number of citizens so widely scattered and so different in their habits in many respects as the americans were nor are the growing unanimity and increasing good will of the citizens to the government less remarkable than favorable circumstances so far as we have gone with the new government and it is completely organized and in operation we have had greater reason than the most sanguine could expect to be satisfied with its success perhaps a number of accidental circumstances have concurred with the real effects of the government to make the people uncommonly well pleased with their situation and prospects the harvests of wheat have been remarkably good the demand for that article from abroad is great the increase of commerce is visible in every port and the number of new manufactures introduced in one year is astonishing i have lately     made a tour through the eastern states i found the country in a great degree recovered from the ravages of war the towns flourishing and the people delighted with a government instituted by themselves and for their own good the same facts i have also reason to believe from good authority exist in the southern states by what i have just observed i think you will be persuaded that the illboding politicians who prognosticated that america never would enjoy any fruits from her independence and that she would be obliged to have recourse to a foreign power for protection have at least been mistaken i shall sincerely rejoice to see that the american revolution has been productive of happy consequences on both sides of the atlantic the renovation of the french constitution is indeed one of the most wonderful events in the history of mankind and the agency of the marquis de lafayette in a high degree honorable to his character my greatest fear has been that the nation would not be sufficiently cool and moderate in making arrangements for the security of that liberty of which it seems to be fully possessed mr warville the french gentleman you mention has been in america and at mount vernon but has returned some time since to france mrs washington is well and desires her compliments may be presented to you we wish the happiness of your fireside as we also long to enjoy that of our own at mount vernon our wishes you know were limited and i think that our plans of living will now be     deemed reasonable by the considerate part of our species her wishes coincide with my own as to simplicity of dress and every thing which can tend to support propriety of character without partaking of the follies of luxury and ostentation i am with great regard c george washington    january    0 new york charles pinckney to charles pinckney governor of south carolina private new york    january    0 dear sir although it is not in my power to enter so fully as i could wish into an investigation of the interesting subjects discussed in your letter of the   th of last month yet i would not deny myself the satisfaction of acknowledging the receipt of it and of expressing my obligations for the sentiments which your excellency has been pleased to suggest      a new monarch having succeeded to the throne of spain it remains to be ascertained how far his court may insist upon those exclusive claims to the navigation of the mississippi which have hitherto     prevented the conclusion of a treaty between the united states and that nation mr gardoqui went to spain some time ago nor have we received any thing official from thence since his departure a private gentleman a man of good intelligence lately returned from spain to america mentions a report was believed when he sailed that the americans of the united states had formed a successful expedition against the spanish territory in their neighborhood and that the report had occasioned great sensations in the kingdom whatever may be the future policy of that nation i am disposed to become as well acquainted with the merits of the subjects which have been agitated between them and us since the war as my other duties and avocations will admit for this reason in particular i thank your excellency for your confidential communication as to the subject of indian affairs i can only say in general that your sentiments on the expediency of entering into treaties with those nations upon just terms perfectly coincide with my own from the official report of the late commissioners for treating with the creeks c it seems almost certain that the connexion of mr mcgillivray with spain was the principal cause for preventing the conclusion of the proposed treaty their report which is this day to be delivered by the secretary at war to the senate will indicate fully the progress and issue of that business and the executive will probably be     possessed of such documents as may be useful in taking ulterior measures  for my own part i am entirely persuaded that the present general government will endeavor to lay the foundation for its proceedings in national justice faith and honor but should the government after having attempted in vain every reasonable pacific measure be obliged to have recourse to arms for the defence of its citizens i am also of opinion that sound policy and good economy will point to a prompt and decisive effort rather than to defensive and lingering operations should your excellency after the expiration of your office prosecute your proposed voyage to france you will find i presume most extraordinary events have taken place in that kingdom although all their political arrangements are not yet settled i hope they will be happily before the period to which you allude my late tour through the eastern states has been of salutary consequence in confirming my health i have likewise had an opportunity of seeing how far the country is recovered from the ravages of war and how well the inhabitants are disposed to support the general government not being master of my own time nor accustomed to make personal engagements which from contingency might become impracticable i can only say in regard to the last paragraph of your letter that nothing would give me greater pleasure than to     have it in my power to visit all the southern states with sentiments of the highest respect i am dear sir c george washington    january    0 new york thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson new york    january    0 dear sir i had the pleasure to receive duly your letter dated the   th of december last but i thought proper to delay answering or mentioning the contents of it until after the arrival of mr madison who i understood had been with you he arrived yesterday and i now take the earliest opportunity of mentioning to you the result of my reflections and the expediency of your deciding at as early a period as may consist with your convenience on the important subject before you previous to any remarks on the nature of the office to which you have been recently appointed i will premise that i feel such delicacy and embarrassment in consequence of the footing on which you have placed your final determination as to make it necessary for me to recur to the first ground on which i rested the matter in confidence therefore i will tell you plainly that i wish not to oppose your inclinations and that after you shall have been made a little farther acquainted with the light in which i view the office of secretary of state it must be at your option to determine relative to your acceptance of it or continuance in your office abroad      i consider the successful administration of the general government as an object of almost infinite consequence to the present and future happiness of the citizens of the united states i consider the office of secretary for the department of state very important on many accounts and i know of no person who in my judgment could better execute the duties of it than yourself its duties will probably be not quite so arduous and complicated in their execution as you might have been led at the first moment to imagine at least it was the opinion of congress that after the division of all the business of a domestic nature between the departments of the treasury war and state those which would be comprehended in the latter might be performed by the same person who should have the charge of conducting the department of foreign affairs the experiment was to be made and if it shall be found that the fact is different i have little doubt that a farther arrangement or division of the business in the office of the department of state will be made in such manner as to enable it to be performed under the superintendence of one man with facility to himself as well as with advantage and satisfaction to the public those observations however you will be pleased to remark are merely matters of opinion but in order that you may be the better prepared to make your ultimate decision on     good grounds i think it necessary to add one fact which is this so far as i have been able to obtain information from all quarters your late appointment has given very extensive and very great satisfaction to the public my original opinion and wish may be collected from my nomination as to what you mention in the latter part of your letter i can only observe i do not know that any alteration is likely to take place in the commission from the united states to the court of france the necessary arrangements with regard to our intercourse with foreign nations have never yet been taken up on a great scale by this government because the department which comprehended affairs of that nature has never been properly organized so as to bring the business well and systematically before the executive if you should finally determine to take upon yourself the duties of the department of state it would be highly requisite for you to come on immediately as many things are required to be done while congress is in session rather that at any other time and as in that case your presence might doubtless be much better dispensed with after a little time than at the present moment or in all events it will be essential that i should be informed of your conclusive option so that if you return to france another person may be at as early a day as possible nominated to fill the department of state with sentiments of the highest regard and esteem i am dear sir c   0 george washington    february    0 new york edmund randolph to edmund randolph attorneygeneral new york    february    0 sir i have weighed with deliberate attention the contents of your letter of yesterday and although that consideration may result in an approbation of the ideas therein suggested yet i do not at present feel myself authorized to give a sanction to the measures which you propose for as the constitution of the united states and the laws made under it must mark the line of my official conduct i could not justify my taking a single step in any matter which appeared to me to require their agency without its being first obtained and so far as i have been able to form a judgment upon the objects held up to view in your letter they cannot be effected without the operation of a law as an act must necessarily be passed to extend the judicial power of the united states to the state of north carolina it appears to me that a clause might be there introduced to establish that uniformity and precision in the business of the united states in each district which you observe is highly proper to be effected and to make such other regulations as may be thought necessary i however only suggest this idea to you that you may if you think proper mention it to such members of the senate and house of representatives as are acquainted with the subject and thereby have the matter brought to view whenever the abovementioned act shall be under consideration i am with great esteem c     george washington    march    0 new york david stuart to david stuart new york    march    0 dear sir       i am sorry such jealousies as you speak of should be gaining ground and are poisoning the minds of the southern people  but admit the fact which is alleged as the cause of them and give it full scope does it amount to more than what was known to every man of information before at and since the adoption of the constitution was it not always believed that there are some points which peculiarly interest the eastern states and did any one who reads human nature and more especially the character of the eastern people conceive that they would not pursue them steadily by a combination of their force     are there not other points which equally concern the southern states if these states are less tenacious of their interest or if whilst the eastern move in a solid phalanx to effect their views the southern are always divided which of the two is most to be blamed that there is a diversity of interests in the union none has denied that this is the case also in every state is equally certain and that it even extends to the counties of individual states can be as readily proved instance the southern and northern parts of virginia the upper and lower parts of south carolina c have not the interests of these always been at variance witness the county of fairfax have not the interests of the people of that county varied or the inhabitants been taught to believe so these are well known truths and yet it did not follow that separation was to result from the disagreement to constitute a dispute there must be two parties to understand it well both parties and all the circumstances must be fully heard and to accommodate differences temper and mutual forbearance are requisite common danger brought the states into confederacy and on their union our safety and importance depend a spirit of accommodation was the basis of the present constitution can it be expected then that the southern or the eastern parts of the empire will succeed in all their measures certainly not but i will readily grant that more points will be carried by the latter than the former and for the reason which has been mentioned namely     that in all great national questions they move in unison whilst the others are divided but i ask again which is most blameworthy those who see and will steadily pursue their interest or those who cannot see or seeing will not act wisely and i will ask another question of the highest magnitude in my mind to wit if the eastern and northern states are dangerous in union will they be less so in separation if selfinterest is their governing principle will it forsake them or be less restrained by such an event i hardly think it would then independent of other considerations what would virginia and such other states as might be inclined to join her gain by a separation would they not most unquestionably be the weaker party men who go from hence without feeling themselves of so much consequence as they wished to be considered and disappointed expectants added to malignant designing characters who miss no opportunity of aiming a blow at the constitution paint highly on one side without bringing into view the arguments which are offered on the other it is to be lamented that the editors of the different gazettes in the union do not more generally and more correctly instead of stuffing their papers with scurrility and nonsensical declamation which few would read if they were apprized of the contents publish the debates in congress on all great national questions and this with no uncommon pains every one of them might do the principles upon which the difference of opinion arises as well as the decisions     would then come fully before the public and afford the best data for its judgment mr madison on the question of discrimination was actuated i am convinced by the purest motives and most heartfelt conviction but the subject was delicate and perhaps had better never been stirred the assumption of the state debts by the united states is another subject that has given rise to long and labored debates without having yet taken a final form the memorial of the quakers and a very malapropos one it was has at length been put to sleep and will scarcely awake before the year   0   i am dear sir c     george washington    april    0 new york marquis de la luzerne to the marquis de la luzerne  new york    april    0 sir your letter of the   th of january replete with politeness to myself and useful informations respecting public affairs has but lately been received  in making my acknowledgments for the distinguished place i hold in your remembrance and for the obliging terms in which you allude to my conduct in war and peace i should do injustice to conceal the favorable sentiments which were always entertained by myself and my countrymen of your private deportment and ministerial agency while you resided in america those times in which we always     found you a sincere friend were truly times of peril and distress now our situation is indeed much more eligible and our prospects perhaps as good as could reasonably have been expected we are recovering slowly from the calamities and burdens with which we were almost overwhelmed by a long and expensive war our crops the year past have been more abundant and our markets much better than usual these circumstances will assist in enabling our citizens to extricate themselves from their private and public debts i hope a disposition will be found to prevail among us for doing justice as far as the nature of the case will admit to all who afforded us their assistance in the hour of adversity in the arrangement of such new and complicated business as must inevitably come before our general government it is reasonably to be expected that the proceedings will be slow it is devoutly to be wished that they may terminate in such just and wise measures as will fully establish our happiness at home and credit abroad i am much pleased with the interest you take in our national reputation and the information you give that our credit is becoming so     respectable in europe under the influence of our new government you are right in conceiving that nothing can be indifferent to me which regards the welfare of the french nation so far removed from that great theatre of political action and so little acquainted with many of the minute circumstances which may induce important decisions as i am it would be imprudent for me to hazard opinions which might possibly be unfounded indeed the whole business is so extraordinary in its commencement so wonderful in its progress and may be so stupendous in its consequences that i am almost lost in the contemplation of one thing however you may rest perfectly assured that nobody is more anxious for the happy issue of that business than i am as nobody can wish more sincerely for the prosperity of the french nation than i do nor is it without the most sensible pleasure i learn that our friend the marquis de lafayette has in acting the arduous part which has fallen to his share conducted himself with so much wisdom and apparently to such general satisfaction we at this great distance from the northern parts of europe hear of wars and rumors of wars as if they were the events or reports of another planet what changes the death of the emperor will occasion in the other cabinets of europe time is yet to inform us a spirit for political improvements seems to be rapidly and extensively spreading through the european countries i shall rejoice in seeing the condition of the human race happier than ever it has     hitherto been but i should be sorry to see that those who are for prematurely accelerating those improvements were making more haste than good speed in their innovations so much prudence so much perseverance so much disinterestedness and so much patriotism are necessary among the leaders of a nation in order to promote the national felicity that sometimes my fears nearly preponderate over my expectations better however will it be for me to leave such foreign matters to those who are more competent to manage them and to do as much good as i can in the little sphere where i am destined to move at present with sentiments of the highest esteem and consideration i have the honor to be c george washington   june    0 new york marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette new york   june    0 my dear marquis your kind letter of the   th of january is as your letters always are extremely acceptable to me by some chance its arrival had been retarded to this time conscious of your friendly dispositions for me and realizing the enormous burden of public business with which you was oppressed i felt no solicitude but that you should go directly forward and happily effect your great undertakings how much how sincerely am i rejoiced my dear marquis to find that things are assuming so favorable an aspect in france be assured that you always have my best and most ardent wishes for your success and that if i have     not troubled you with letters of late it was because i had nothing which it was very essential to communicate and because i knew how much better your time was employed than in answering letters merely of a private nature you have doubtless been informed from time to time of the happy progress of our affairs the principal difficulties which opposed themselves in any shape to the prosperous execution of our government seem in a great measure to have been surmounted a good temper prevails among our citizens rhode island has just now acceded to the constitution and has thus united under the general government all the states of the original confederacy  vermont we hope will soon come within the pale of the union two new states exist under the immediate direction of the general government viz that at the head of which is general st clair and that which consists of the territory lately ceded by the state of north carolina our government is now happily carried into operation although some thorny questions still remain it is to be hoped that the wisdom of those concerned in the national legislature will dispose of them prudently a funding system is one of the subjects which occasions most anxiety and perplexity yet our revenues have been considerably more productive than it was imagined they would be in the last year the plentiful crops and great prices of grain have vastly augmented our remittances the rate   0 of exchange is also much in our favor importations of european goods have been uncommonly extensive and the duties payable into the public treasury proportionably so our trade to the east indies flourishes the profits to individuals are so considerable as to induce more persons to engage in it continually a single vessel just arrived in this port pays thirty thousand dollars to government two vessels fitted out for the fur trade to the northwest coast of america have succeeded well the whole outfits of vessels and cargoes cost but seven thousand pounds one is returning home loaded with india produce the other going back to the coast of america and they have deposited one hundred thousand dollars of their profits in china i mention this to show the spirit of enterprise that prevails i hope and trust our commerce with the west india islands belonging to different nations which is at present of no great consequence will shortly be placed upon a better footing as the people of this country are sensible of the generous conduct of the french nation i can with great satisfaction give it as my decided opinion that the most friendly dispositions prevail on our side of the water towards that nation many of your old acquaintances and friends are concerned with me in the administration of this government by having mr jefferson at the head of the department of state mr jay of the judiciary hamilton of the treasury and knox of that of war i feel myself supported by able coadjutors who harmonize     extremely well together i believe that these and the other appointments generally have given perfect satisfaction to the public poor colonel harrison who was appointed one of the judges of the supreme court and declined is lately dead  i have a few days since had a severe attack of the peripneumony kind but am now recovered except in point of strength my physicians advise me to more exercise and less application to business i cannot however avoid persuading myself that it is essential to accomplish whatever i have undertaken though reluctantly to the best of my abilities but it is thought congress will have a recess this summer in which case i propose going for a while to mount vernon with sentiments of the sincerest affection i am my dear marquis c george washington    june    0 new york david stuart to david stuart new york    june    0 dear sir your letter of the  d instant came duly to hand if there are any gazettes among my files at mount vernon which can be of use to you they are at your service your description of the public mind in virginia gives me pain it seems to be more irritable sour and discontented than from the information i receive it is in any other state in the union except     massachusetts which from the same causes but on quite different principles is tempered like it  that congress does not proceed with all that despatch which people at a distance expect and which     were they to hurry business they possibly might is not to be denied that measures have been agitated which are not pleasing to virginia and others pleasing perhaps to her but not so to some other states     is equally unquestionable can it well be otherwise in a country so extensive so diversified in its interests and will not these different interests naturally produce in an assembly of representatives who are to legislate for and to assimilate and reconcile them to the general welfare long warm and animated debates most assuredly they will and if there was the same propensity in mankind for investigating the motives as there is for censuring the conduct of public characters it would be found that the censure so freely bestowed is oftentimes unmerited and uncharitable for instance the condemnation of congress for sitting only four hours in the day the fact is by the established rules of the house of representatives no committee can sit whilst the house is sitting and this is and has been for a considerable time from ten oclock in the forenoon until three often later in the afternoon     before and after which the business is going on in committees if this application is not as much as most constitutions are equal to i am mistaken many other things which undergo malignant constructions would be found upon a candid examination to wear better faces than is given to them the misfortune is that the enemies to the government always more active than its friends and always upon the watch to give it a stroke neglect no opportunity to aim one if they tell truth it is not the whole truth by which means one side only of the picture is exhibited whereas if both sides were seen it might and probably would assume a different form in the opinion of just and candid men who are disposed to measure matters by a continental scale i do not mean however from what i have here said to justify the conduct of congress in all its movements for some of these movements in my opinion have been injudicious and others unseasonable whilst the questions of assumption residence and other matters have been agitated with a warmth and intemperance with prolixity and threats which it is to be feared has lessened the dignity of that body and decreased that respect which was once entertained for it and this misfortune is increased by many members even among those who wish well to the government ascribing in letters to their respective states when they are defeated in a favorite measure the worst motives for the conduct of their opponents who viewing matters through another medium may and do retort in their turn by which     means jealousies and distrusts are spread most impolitically far and wide and will it is to be feared have a most unhappy tendency to injure our public affairs which if wisely managed might make us as we are now by europeans thought to be the happiest people upon earth as a proof of it our reputation has risen in every part of the globe and our credit especially in holland above par where our funds are has got higher than that of any nation in europe as appears by official advices just received but the conduct we seem to be pursuing must soon bring us back to our former disreputable condition the introduction of the quaker memorial respecting slavery was to be sure not only illtimed but occasioned a great waste of time the final decision however thereon was as favorable as the proprietors of this species of property could well have expected considering the light in which slavery is viewed by a large part of this union the question of assumption has occupied a great deal of time and no wonder for it is certainly a very important question and under proper restrictions and scrutiny into accounts will be found i conceive to be a just one the cause in which the expenses of the war were incurred was a common cause the states in congress declared it so at the beginning and pledged themselves to stand by each other if then some states were harder pressed than others or from particular and local circumstances contracted heavier debts it is but reasonable when this fact is clearly ascertained though it is a sentiment     which i have not communicated here that an allowance ought to be made them had the invaded and hard pressed states believed the case would have been otherwise opposition would very soon i believe have changed to submission in them and given a different termination to the war  in a letter of last year to the best of my recollection i informed you of the motives which compelled me to allot a day for the reception of idle and ceremonious visits for it never has prevented those of sociability and friendship in the afternoon or at any other time but if i am mistaken in this the history of this business is simply and shortly as follows before the custom was established which now accommodates foreign characters strangers and others     who from motives of curiosity respect to the chief magistrate or any other cause are induced to call upon me i was unable to attend to any business whatsoever for gentlemen consulting their own convenience rather than mine were calling from the time i rose from breakfast often before until i sat down to dinner this as i resolved not to neglect my public duties reduced me to the choice of one of these alternatives either to refuse them altogether or to appropriate a time for the reception of them the former would i well knew be disgusting to many the latter i expected would undergo animadversion and blazoning from those who would find fault with or without cause to please everybody was impossible i therefore adopted that line of conduct which combined public advantage with private convenience and which in my judgment was unexceptionable in itself that i have not been able to make bows to the taste of poor colonel bland who by the by i believe never saw one of them is to be regretted especially too as upon those occasions they were indiscriminately bestowed and the best i was master of would it not have been better to throw the veil of charity over them ascribing their stiffness to the effects of age or to the unskillfulness of my teacher than to pride and dignity of office which god knows has no charms for me for i can truly say i had rather be at mount vernon with a friend or two about me than to be attended at the seat of government by the officers of state and the representatives of every power in europe     these visits are optional they are made without invitation between the hours of three and four every tuesday i am prepared to receive them gentlemen often in great numbers come and go chat with each other and act as they please a porter shows them into the room and they retire from it when they please and without ceremony at their first entrance they salute me and i them and as many as i can talk to i do what pomp there is in all this i am unable to discover perhaps it consists in not sitting to this two reasons are opposed first it is unusual secondly which is a more substantial one because i have no room large enough to contain a third of the chairs which would be sufficient to admit it if it is supposed that ostentation or the fashions of courts which by the by i believe originate oftener in convenience not to say necessity than is generally imagined gave rise to this custom i will boldly affirm that no supposition was ever more erroneous for if i was to give indulgence to my inclinations every moment that i could withdraw from the fatigue of my station should be spent in retirement that they are not proceeds from the sense i entertain of the propriety of giving to every one as free access as consists with that respect which is due to the chair of government and that respect i conceive is neither to be acquired nor preserved but by observing a just medium between much state and too great familiarity similar to the above but of a more sociable kind are the visits every friday afternoon to mrs washington   0 where i always am these public meetings and a dinner once a week to as many as my table will hold with the references to and from the different departments of state and other communications with all parts of the union are as much if not more than i am able to undergo for i have already had within less than a year two severe attacks the last worse than the first a third more than probable will put me to sleep with my fathers at what distance this may be i know not within the last twelve months i have undergone more and severer sickness than thirty preceding years afflicted me with put it all together i have abundant reason however to be thankful that i am so well recovered though i still feel the remains of the violent affection of my lungs the cough pain in my breast and shortness in breathing not having entirely left me i propose in the recess of congress to visit mount vernon but when this recess will happen is beyond my ken or the ken i believe of any of its members i am dear sir c george washington  0 july    0 new york clement biddle to clement biddle new york  0 july    0 dear sir the first request of this letter is that you would burn it as soon as you have read it and keep the contents to yourself at least for the present some months ago farms lately in the tenure of mr abel james were advertised for sale by you and mr     henry drinker these farms i have seen but not it is to be acknowledged with the eyes of a purchaser the one near frankfort you inform the public contains     acres that another called callenders contains    acres and a third near the last contains upwards of  0 acres let me now ask if all or any of these are yet for sale what is the lowest price that would be taken for each and whether payment would be received in valuable lands improved in the counties of fayette and washington in the state of pennsylvania one tract of which in fayettecounty contains between sixteen and   00 acres on the great road from fort cumberland to pittsburg distant    miles from the former and  0 from the latter place equal in quality to any tract in that country with what has been a very valuable mill and iron ore adjoining but which is now much out of repair the other tract containing upwards of  000 acres lyes about sixteen miles from pittsburg and is also good in quality and more level than usual i shall candidly declare that to pay money is out of the question with me—i have none and would not if it was to be had run in debt to borrow—nor would it do for me to dispose of real property to obtain it when that species of property is brought to low ebb and dull market  an exchange as proposed if ready     money is not indispensable might be mutually advantageous to both parties in as much as the probability is that the price of the exterior will increase in a full ratio with that of the interior lands if the farms advertised by you and mr drinker are sold or if they are not now for sale let me next ask if they will be to be rented and for what i ask these questions however more from motives of curiosity than from any expectation of becoming the renter of either of them because the principal buildings which would be of little value to me in this case might considerably enhance the rent and because my objects being for the amusement of farming and for the benefit arising from exercise the distance from the city being convenient for the latter i should not incline to lay out much money upon a rented farm for a short tenure and for a long one i should have no occasion for a place in that way having communicated the matter thus far to you i will in a few words add as my own opinion strengthened by those of my physicians that my late change from active scenes to which i had been accustomed and in which the mind has been agreeably amused to the     one of inactivity which i now lead and where the thoughts are continually on the stretch has been the cause of more illness and severe attacks of my constitution within the last twelve months than i had undergone in  0 years preceding put together a deviation therefore is necessary i have not because you were one from whom the terms of sale of jamess lands were to be known scrupled to make these communications at the moment that i ask the lowest price that would be taken for each of these farms frankly i declare it to be my intention not to give a high price for either of them depreciated as real property is nor will i higgle about the price if it is moderate and i am dealt with candidly i will say in a word whether it will suit me to become a purchaser—chaffering i shall avoid the largest farm would be most congenial to my wishes—perhaps one of the others might do i am c george washington    august    0 new york marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette new york    august    0 my dear marquis i have received your affectionate letter of the   th of march by one conveyance and the token of victory  gained by liberty over despotism by another for both which testimonials of your friendship and regard i pray you to accept my sincerest thanks in this great subject of triumph for the new world and for humanity in general it will never be forgotten     how conspicuous a part you bore and how much lustre you reflected on a country in which you made the first displays of character  happy am i my good friend that amidst all the tremendous tempests which have assailed your political ship you have had address and fortitude enough to steer her hitherto safely through the quicksands and rocks which threatened instant destruction on every side and that your young king in all things seems so well disposed to conform to the wishes of the nation in such an important such a hazardous voyage when every thing dear and sacred is embarked you know full well my best wishes have never left you for a moment yet i will avow that the accounts we received through the english papers which were sometimes our only channels for information caused our fears of a failure almost to exceed our expectations of success how much will the concerned be indebted to the exertions of the principal pilot when the ship shall at the end of her dangerous course be securely harbored in the haven of national tranquillity freedom and glory to which she is destined and which i hope she is near attaining congress after having been in session ever since last fall are to adjourn in two or three days though     they have been much perplexed and delayed in their proceedings on some questions of a local and intricate nature yet they have done a great deal of important business and will leave the public affairs in as satisfactory a state as could reasonably have been expected one of the last acts of the executive has been the conclusion of a treaty of peace and friendship with the creek nation of indians who have been considerably connected with the spanish provinces and hostile to the georgian frontiers since the war with great britain  mcgillivray and about thirty of the kings and head men are here this event will leave us in peace from one end of our borders to the other except where it may be interrupted by a small refugee banditti of cherokees and shawnees who can be easily chastised or even extirpated if it shall become necessary but this will only be done in an inevitable extremity since the basis of our proceedings with the indian nations has been and shall be justice during the period in which i have any thing to do with the administration of this government our negotiations and transactions though many of them are on a small scale as to the objects ought to be governed by the immutable principles of equity as much as your european politics which are more extended in their compass how your wars proceed     in the north or in whose favor they are likely to terminate what probability there may be that the misunderstandings between britain and spain should issue in an open rupture and what other powerful nations in that event will be drawn in to take an active part on one side or the other are subjects of vast magnitude on which we in these distant regions must abstain from deciding positively even in our minds until we shall have more unequivocal data to go upon it seems to be our policy to keep in the situation in which nature has placed us to observe a strict neutrality and to furnish others with those good things of subsistence which they may want and which our fertile land abundantly produces if circumstances and events will permit us so to do      this letter is committed to colonel humphreys to carry to london whither he is going should he by any accident be in france he will be able to give you a full state of our affairs and prospects gradually recovering from the distresses in which the war left us patiently advancing in our task of civil government unentangled in the crooked policies of europe wanting scarcely any thing but the free navigation of     the mississippi which we must have and as certainly shall have as we remain a nation i have supposed that with the undeviating exercise of a just steady and prudent national policy we shall be the gainers whether the powers of the old world may be in peace or war but more especially in the latter case in that case our importance will certainly increase and our friendship be courted our dispositions would not be indifferent to britain or spain why will not spain be wise and liberal at once it would be easy to annihilate all causes of quarrels between that nation and the united states at this time at a future period that may be far from being a fact should a war take place between great britain and spain i conceive from a great variety of concurring circumstances there is the highest probability that the floridas will soon be in the possession of the former adieu my dear marquis believe me to be assuredly and affectionately your friend c p s not for the value of the thing my dear marquis but as a memorial and because they are the manufacture of this city i send you herewith a pair of shoebuckles     george washington    august    0 new york henry knox to henry knox secretary of war new york    august    0 sir the session of congress having closed and it being my intention to go to virginia as soon as the public business will permit and wishing during my absence from the seat of government to have my mind as free from public cares as circumstances will allow i am desirous of having such matters as may by law or otherwise require the agency or sanction of the president of the united states brought to view before my departure i therefore request that you will cause such business within your department as may be necessary to receive the aid or approbation of the president to be submitted to me as soon as its nature will permit particularly regulations for trade and intercourse with the indian tribes agreeably to the act and information and opinions on the following points— whether any other and what steps shall be taken with them to restrain their hostilities whether the orders given and measures adopted are adequate to the peace of the western frontiers if not what further is to be done for this purpose upon the expediency and policy of a proclamation forbidding encroachments upon the territory of the indians or treating with them contrary to the law lately passed instructions for the governor of the ceded territory south of the ohio where ought the governor to reside what notice should be taken of the insult offered to major doughty what steps  00 should be taken with respect to his recommendation of a post at the mouth of the tennessee other measures than those pursued by the present contractors for supplying the western posts ought to be adopted that the troops in that country may be more efficiently employed in sudden emergencies and the posts better secured have any orders been given concerning the condemned soldiers i am sir c   0  george washington  0 october    0 mount vernon alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton secretary of the treasury mount vernon  0 october    0 dear sir your letter of the  0th ultimo duly came to hand with its enclosures for the information contained in it i thank you the motives however by which the author of the communication to you was actuated although they may have been pure and in that case praiseworthy do also but it may be uncharitable to  0  harbour the suspicion admit of a different interpretation and by an easy and pretty direct clue may be developed  we are approaching the first monday in december by hasty strides i pray you therefore to revolve in your mind such matters as may be proper  0  for me to lay before congress not only in your own department if any there be but such others of a general nature as may happen to occur to you that i may be prepared to open the session with such communications as shall appear to merit attention with sincere regard i am dear sir c george washington    november    0 mount vernon tobias lear to tobias lear mount vernon    november    0 dear sir having wrote two letters to you on the subject of pages stage coach one or the other of which if not both it is presumable have got to hand before this can i shall add nothing more thereto than that pages coach is now my dependence  i am i must confess exceedingly unwilling to go into any house without first knowing on what terms i do it and wish that this sentiment could be again hinted in delicate terms to the parties concerned with me i cannot if there are no latent motives which govern in this case see any difficulty in the business  mr morris has most assuredly formed an idea of what ought in equity to be the rent of the  0  tenement in the condition he left it and with this aid the committee ought i conceive to be as little at a loss in determining what it should rent for with the additions and alterations which are about to be made and which ought to be done in a plain and neat not by any means in an extravagant style because the latter is not only contrary to my wish but would really be detrimental to my interest and convenience principally because it would be the means of keeping me out of the use and comforts of the house to a late period and because the furniture and every thing else would require to be accordant therewith besides it s making me pay an extravagant price perhaps accommodate the alterations to the taste of another or to the exorbitant rates of workmen or their blended performances in the two houses i do not know nor do i believe that any thing unfair is intended by either mr morris or the committee but let us for a moment suppose that the rooms the new ones i mean was to be hung with tapestry or a very rich and costly paper neither of which would suit my present furniture that costly ornaments for the bow windows extravagant chimneypieces c c were to be provided that workmen from extravagance of the times for every twenty shillings worth of work would charge forty shillings and that advantage should be taken of the occasion to new paint every part of the house buildings c would there be any propriety in adding ten or twelve and a half per cent for all this to the  0  rent of the house in its original state for the two years that i am to hold it if the solution of these questions is in the negative wherein lies the difficulty of determining that the houses and lots when finished according to the proposed plan ought to rent for so much when all is done that can be done thereto the residence will not be so commodious as the house i left in new york with the additional buildings made there for there and the want of it will be found a real inconvenience at mr morriss my office was in a front room below where persons on business were at once admitted whereas now they will have to ascend two pair of stairs and to pass by the public rooms to get to it notwithstanding which i am willing to allow as much as was paid to mr macomb and shall say nothing if more is demanded unless there is apparent extortion—extortion if it should be intended by delay is to see to what height rents will rise i should be unwilling to—and to take it at the expense of any public body i will not  there is one expression in your letter of the  th the meaning of which i do not clearly understand viz the additions repairs c of the house in which mr morris now lives are likewise to be comprehended in the expenditure to be refunded by the rent of the house is it meant by this that the rent of the house you are now in is to be increased by the expenditures on the one mr morris  0  has removed to or is no more meant by it than that the rent of the former is intended as security for the refund the latter may be very proper but the former could be submitted to on no other ground than that of dire necessity i had rather have heard that my repaired coach was plain and elegant than rich and elegant i am dear sir c george washington    november    0 mount vernon henry knox to henry knox secretary of war private mount vernon    november    0 my dear sir i have received your letter of the  0th inst and will declare to you without reserve that my forebodings with respect to the expedition against the wabash indians are of disappointment and a disgraceful termination under the conduct of brigadier general harmar— i expected little from the moment i heard he was a drunkard—i expected less as soon as i heard that on this account no confidence was reposed in him by the people of the western country—and i gave up all hope of success as soon as i heard that there were disputes with him about command— the latter information is from report only but the report of bad news is rarely without foundation—if the issue of this expedition is honorable to the concerters of it and favorable to our arms it will be double pleasing to me but my mind from the silence  0  which reigns and other circumstances is prepared for the worst—that is—for expence without honor or profit—  if any thing more than the statement of this business for the information of congress should occur to you previous to my arrival be so good as to digest it for it is my wish to have every matter which may occur to the heads of departments as well as to  0  myself ready if proper to lay before that body at the opening of the session with sincere friendship c p s i expect to commence my journey for philadelphia on monday —but from the state of the roads after the incessant and heavy rains which have fallen my progress must be slow— george washington   december    0 philadelphia george steptoe washington to george steptoe washington philadelphia   december    0 dear george agreeably to the promise which i gave to you in virginia i have made the necessary inquiries respecting the course of studies and expenses which would enable you and your brother lawrence to finish your education at the college in this place provided you are masters of those books and studies which you informed me you had passed through the enclosed account of studies and expenses which i wish you to return to me you will see is under the hand of the reverend dr smith provost of the college and may therefore be relied upon for its accuracy after you and lawrence have carefully perused and well considered the enclosed statement i wish you to determine whether you will come or not if your determination should be in favor of coming on i must impress this upon you both in the strongest manner namely that you come with good  0  dispositions and full resolution to pursue your studies closely conform to the established rules and customs of the college and to conduct yourselves on all occasions with decency and propriety to you george i would more particularly address myself at this time as from your advanced age it may be presumed that such advice as i am about to give will make a deeper impression upon you than upon your brother and your conduct may very probably mark the line of his but at the same time lawrence must remember that this is equally applicable to him should you enter upon the course of studies here marked out you must consider it as the finishing of your education and therefore as the time is limited that every hour misspent is lost for ever and that future years cannot compensate for lost days at this period of your life this reflection must show the necessity of an unremitting application to your studies to point out the importance of circumspection in your conduct it may be proper to observe that a good moral character is the first essential in a man and that the habits contracted at your age are generally indelible and your conduct here may stamp your character through life it is therefore highly important that you should endeavor not only to be learned but virtuous much more might be said to show the necessity of application and regularity but when you must know that without them you can never be qualified to render service to your country assistance to your friends or consolation to your   0 retired moments nothing further need be said to prove their utility as to your clothing it will i presume cost much the same here as in alexandria i shall always wish to see you clothed decently and becoming your stations but i shall ever discountenance extravagance or foppishness in your dress at all times and upon all occasions i shall be happy to give you both such marks of my approbation as your progress and good conduct merit if you determine to come on you had better do it immediately and major washington will furnish you with such money as may be necessary for the stage and expenses from alexandria to this place but i must repeat what i have before enjoined that you come with good dispositions and determined resolutions to conform to establishments and pursue your studies your aunt joins me in love to you both and best wishes to dr craik and family i am dear george your sincere friend and affectionate uncle end of vol xi   after this letter had been read the legislature passed an act withdrawing the donation and adding that the said shares with the tolls and profits hereafter accruing therefrom shall stand appropriated to such objects of a public nature in such manner and under such distributions as the said george washington by deed during his life or by his last will and testament shall direct—henings statutes vol xii p    the letter is printed in the preamble to the statute in writing to mr madison on the subject at the time he sent the above letter to the governor washington said conceiving it would be better to suggest a wish than to propose an absolute condition of acceptance i have so expressed myself to the assembly and i shall be obliged to you not only for information of the result but if there is an acquiescence on the part of the country for your sentiments respecting the appropriations from what may be said on the occasion you will learn what will be most pleasing and of the greatest utility to the public—october   th your letter for the assembly was laid before them yesterday i have reason to believe that it was received with every sentiment which could correspond with yours nothing passed from which any conjecture could be formed as to the objects which would be most pleasing for the appropriation of the fund the disposition is i am persuaded much stronger to acquiesce in your choice whatever it may be than to lead or anticipate it i see no inconveniency in your taking time for a choice that will please yourself the letter was referred to a committee which will no doubt make such a report as will give effect to your wishes—madison to washington    november        it was on december  0th that washington informed lund that his wish for retiring from the management of mount vernon could be gratified george augustine washington came to mt vernon and was placed in charge   if the states individually were to attempt this an abortion or a many headed monster would be the issue—washington to david stuart  0 november        the discussion of them the commercial propositions has consumed much time and though the absolute necessity of some such general system prevailed over all the efforts of its adversaries in the first instance the stratagem of limiting its duration to a short term has ultimately disappointed our hopes i think it better to trust to further experience and even distress for an adequate remedy than to try a temporary measure which may stand in the way of a permanent one and confirm that transatlantic policy which is founded on our supposed mistrust of congress and of one another—madison to washington   december        i have received the pamphlet which you were so obliging as to send me entitled considerations on the order of cincinnatus by the count de mirabeau i thank you my good sir for this instance of your attention but wish you had taken time to have perused it first as i have not yet had leisure to give it a reading i thought as most others seemed to think that all the exceptionable parts of that institution had been done away at the last general meeting but with those who are disposed to cavil or who have the itch of writing strongly upon them nothing can be made to suit their palates the best way therefore to disconcert and defeat them is to take no notice of their publications all else is but food for declamation there is not i conceive an unbiassed mind that would refuse the officers of the late army the right of associating for the purpose of establishing a fund for the support of the poor and distressed of their fraternity when many of them it is well known are reduced to their last shifts by the ungenerous conduct of their country in not adopting more vigorous measures to render their certificates productive that charity is all that remains of the original institution none who will be at the trouble of reading it can deny—washington to samuel vaughan  0 november        the above proposal was accepted by the trustees of the alexandria academy who engaged on their part to do all in their power to comply with the benevolent intention of the donor it was in their opinion best to appropriate the fund to the institution as then established and wholly for schooling   an arrangement was made satisfactory to both parties and mr lear a young gentleman from portsmouth in new hampshire who had recently graduated at harvard university went to mount vernon and became general washingtons secretary at an annual salary of two hundred dollars   a nephew of the engineer who conducted the work of the duke of bridgewater he was engaged by the susquehanna company   this convention met at annapolis in september      five states only were represented and when the members came together they found themselves invested with such limited powers as not to enable them to act for the general purposes of the meeting they did little else than to draw up a report to be presented to the several states urging the necessity of a revision of the confederated system of government and recommending a convention of delegates with larger powers to be held at philadelphia on the  d of may following   my sentiments with respect to the federal government are well known publicly and privately have they been communicated without reserve but my opinion is that there is more wickedness than ignorance in the conduct of the states or in other words in the conduct of those who have too much influence in the government of them and until the curtain is withdrawn and the private views and selfish principles upon which these men act are exposed to public notice i have little hope of amendment without another convulsion the picture of our affairs as drawn by the committee approved by congress and presented to the public did not at all surprise me before that report though i could not go into the minutiæ of matters i was more certain of the aggregate of our ills than i am now of the remedy which will be applied without the latter i do not see upon what ground your agent at the court of morocco and the other at algiers are to treat unless having to do with new hands they mean to touch the old strings and make them dance awhile to the tune of promises—washington to henry lee   april      the report of congress is printed in the journals of congress february  d  th and   th      our federal distresses said mr lee gather fast to a point new jersey has refused the requisition and will not grant a shilling till new york accedes to the impost perhaps this intemperance in jersey may bring this state to acquiesce in a system of finance long ago approved by ten states and whose operation might have saved the difficulties which impend over the union—new york march  d   see life of john jay vol i p       this subject appears to have been made a matter of much more public importance than its merits deserved it is fully explained in the life of john jay vol i pp  0       this advertisement is reprinted in the magazine of american history      p       tench tilghman died    april        col humphreys published in the columbian magazine for january      many of the papers relating to the asgill affair   mr lees reply to the above showed that the general voice in congress was not for insisting on the navigation of the mississippi as a necessary requisite in a treaty with spain your reasoning said he is perfectly conformable to the prevalent doctrine on that subject in congress we are very solicitous to form a treaty with spain for commercial purposes indeed no nation in europe can give us conditions so advantageous to our trade as that kingdom the carrying business they are like ourselves in and this common source of difficulty in adjusting commercial treaties between other nations does not apply to america and spain but my dear general i do not think you go far enough rather than defer longer a free and liberal system of trade with spain why not agree to the exclusion of the mississippi this exclusion will not cannot exist longer than the infancy of the western emigrants therefore to those people what is now done cannot be important to the atlantic states it is highly important for we have no prospect of bringing to a conclusion our negotiations with the court of madrid but by yielding the navigation of the mississippi their minister here is under positive instructions on that point in all other arrangements the spanish monarch will give to the states testimonies of his regard and friendship and i verily believe that if the above difficulty should be removed we should soon experience the advantages which would flow from a connexion with spain—july  d if i stopped short of your ideas respecting the navigation of the mississippi or of what may be the opinions of congress on this subject it was not from want of coincidence of sentiments but because i was ignorant at that time of the rubs which are in the way of your commercial treaty with spain and because i thought some address might be necessary to temporize with and keep the settlement of kentucky in a state of quietness at this moment that settlement is formidable population is rapidly increasing there there are many ambitious and turbulent spirits among its inhabitants who from the present difficulties in their intercourse with the atlantic states have turned their eyes to new orleans and may become riotous and ungovernable if the hope of traffic with it is cut off by treaty notwithstanding if this cession is counterpoised it may be a more favorable time for congress to speak decisively to them than when they have got stronger but not sufficiently matured to force the passage of the mississippi themselves whilst the plans which are in agitation for opening communications with that territory may if successful unfold to them new prospects mutually beneficial to the old and new states all these matters no doubt will be duly considered by congress and a decision had on whichever side the advantages preponderate—washington to henry lee  0 july      even lafayette had left the country carrying an impression that many people did not desire the navigation of the mississippi as it might prove the excess of a very good thing—the opening of waterways it is curious that at this time the spanish representative gardoqui believed that he had gained the support of richard henry lee to his policy mi respectable amico el expresidente mr ricardo henry lee por que es todo nuestro y miembro de virginia en este congresso cuya presencia acrobardara a sus concolegas y es capaz de dar doble consistencia a nuestras ideas—gardoqui to florida blanca    may        mr grayson had written till within a short time the representation has been so thin as to render it impracticable for congress to undertake any matter of importance although there are many which require their serious attention—may   th   alluding to the tract of country usually called the connecticut reserve making a part of the state of ohio and situate on the south side of lake erie speaking of the measure as acceded to by congress mr grayson said the consequence i apprehend is a clear loss of about six millions of acres to the united states which had already been ceded by virginia and new york for the assembly of connecticut now sitting will unquestionably open a landoffice and the federal constitution has not given a court in this instance the advocates for this measure urged in favor of its adoption that the claim of a powerful state although unsupported by right was under present circumstances a disagreeable thing that sacrifices must be made for the public tranquillity as well as to acquire an indisputable title to the residue that connecticut would settle it immediately with emigrants welldisposed to the union who would form a barrier not only against the british but the indian tribes and that the thick settlement they would immediately form would enhance the value of the adjacent country and facilitate emigrations thereto—upon these grounds the cession on the part of connecticut was accepted by congress the reservation above mentioned being conceded at the same time all the delegates except those from virginia and maryland voted in favor of the proposition—journals may   th   by the seventh article of the treaty of peace the posts held by the british within the united states were to be evacuated by the fourth article every facility was to be allowed to british subjects to collect the debts due to them in the several states lord carmarthen had shown by quoting the recent laws of some of the states that obstacles had been thrown in the way of collecting such debts and that the fourth article of the treaty was thus violated which was the reason why the posts were not given up   i thank your excellency for the details which you have so kindly given me respecting american affairs the sentiments at versailles are similar to your own in regard to the powers that the states ought to grant to congress for the purpose of a general regulation of commerce so wise and prudent a measure cannot surely result in any detriment to liberty and the americans have too much intelligence and good sense not to perceive that foreign powers who desire commercial alliances with them cannot treat with thirteen distinct states which having different interests among themselves can only act in a united capacity through congress in adopting such general measures as will redound to the advantage of the republic i hope the next news which we shall receive from america will inform us that the several legislatures have put the last hand to this important affair—luzerne to washington  d february        greene died near savannah    june      aged fortyfour persuaded as i always have been of genl greenes integrity and worth i spurned those reports which tended to calumniate his conduct in the connection with banks being perfectly convinced that whenever the matter should be investigated his motives for entering into it would appear pure and unimpeachable—i was not without my fears though that he might suffer in a pecuniary way by his engagement with this man—i would fain hope however that the case may ultimately be otherwise and that upon a final settlement of his affairs there will be a handsome competency for mrs greene and the children—but should the case be otherwise and mrs greene yourself and mr rutledge would think proper to entrust my namesake g washington greene to my care i will give him as good an education as this country i mean the united states will afford and will bring him up to either of the genteel professions that his frds may chuse or his own inclination shall lead him to pursue at my own cost  expence i condole very sincerely with mrs greene to whom please to tender my respects and the rest of general greenes friends at the loss the public as well as his family has sustained by the death of this valuable character—especially at this crisis—when the political machine seems pregnant with the most awful events—washington to jeremiah wadsworth    october        died   june        the commissioners for making treaties in europe of which colonel humphreys was secretary having been dissolved he returned to the united states in may and since that time he had passed several days at mount vernon he was now in connecticut   this letter may be seen under the date of june  th   probably an error of the transcriber for asgill   as mercer could pay his debt in no other way washington agreed to take six male negroes three or four young fellows for ditchers and the like number of well grown lads for artificers it is for you to determine whether you can supply me with such negroes if you agree to do it and will appoint a time i would send for them relying on your word that the whole are healthy and none of them addicted to running away the latter i abominate and unhealthy negroes women or children would not suit my purpose on any terms—washington to mercer   november      it is not my wish to be your competitor in the purchase of any of mr hunters tradesmen especially as i am in a great degree principled against increasing my number of slaves by purchase and suppose moreover that negroes sold on credit will go high yet as you are not disposed to buy the bricklayer which is advertised for sale for your own use and find him in the vigor of life from report a good workman and of tolerable character and his price does not exceed one hundred or a few more pounds i should be glad if you would buy him for me i have much work in this way to do this summer if he has a family with which he is to be sold or from whom he would reluctantly part i decline the purchase his feelings i would not be the means of hurting in the latter case nor at any rate be incumbered with the former—washington to henry lee   february        to understand the full purport of the views here advanced it is necessary to know the plan of the society as described by mr bushrod washington in his letter to his uncle we have lately instituted a society in these lower counties said he called the patriotic society as it is something new and there are a few men both good and sensible who disapprove of it it will be a high gratification to me to know your sentiments of it if you will be so kind as to communicate them the object of the institution is to inquire into the state of public affairs to consider in what the true happiness of the people consists and what are the evils which have pursued and still continue to molest us the means of attaining the former and escaping the latter to inquire into the conduct of those who represent us and to give them our sentiments upon those laws which ought to be or are already made it will also be a considerable object to instil principles of frugality into the minds of the people both by precept and example if any real good should result from such a society we hope similar ones will be generally instituted through the state and if so they may establish a very formidable check upon evildisposed men who clothed with power make interested motives and not public good the rule of their conduct these are the general outlines of the institution and whether in the event it may be beneficial or not i think that it has taken its rise in virtuous motives we have had a considerable meeting of the most sensible and respectable gentlemen in this part of the country and another is to be held on tuesday next previous to the meeting of the assembly our design is to hold another as soon as the assembly has risen the first to instruct our delegates what they ought to do the next to inquire what they have done—bushfield september   th such was mr bushrod washingtons first outline of the patriotic society in answering the above letter from his uncle he added the following explanations the motives which gave birth to the society were these we conceived that in a government where the voice and sentiments of the people are delivered by representation the few who are elected to speak these sentiments are the servants of the electors that in grand points of national concern the people are the best judges of their wants their own interests and can more sensibly feel those evils which they wish to be corrected that upon these two principles they have a right to instruct their delegates and that silence at a time when they had reason to apprehend a conduct in these servants contrary to their wishes would be highly criminal we thought that an appearance of corruption was discoverable in the mass of the people or what is as bad a total insensibility to their public interest persuaded of this and equally convinced that this inattention proceeded more from the want of information than from want of real virtue a number of the principal gentlemen in these four counties determined to assemble for the purpose of inquiring and deliberating upon such subjects as were of the most interesting consequence and to communicate their sentiments to the people in the form of instructions which if approved by them are signed and sent to their delegates if otherwise they continue only the opinion of a few and can have no weight the peoples attention being thus awakened to their public concerns they are led to investigate the causes of those evils which oppress them and to endeavor by some method to relieve them the most uninquiring mind must when put in action perceive that the defect is either in the manners of the people or in the misconduct of those who being intrusted to form salutary laws have adopted the most destructive measures the evil when seen may easily be removed and unless the majority of the people are vitiated which can hardly be the case they would certainly be led to apply the only two possible remedies the one to exert more zeal in making a judicious choice of delegates the other to reform their manners i am fully convinced that nothing could be more effective of the prosperity of this country than the method you have pointed out of electing honest and able representatives to recommend this to the attention of the people is a principal object with this society thus you will perceive that this institution assumes no other power than that of recommending to the people an attention to their own interests and of furnishing them with the sentiments and opinions of a few which they may either reject or adopt it is true that a few designing men might creep into these societies but i should hope that a majority will be virtuous if this should be the case their recommendation may have happy consequences if the majority should unhappily be vicious they are but the opinions of a few expressed collectively in this however i am resolved that as soon as i perceive that other motives than those of the public good influence their conduct i will quit them—october   st   for gods sake tell me what is the cause of all these commotions do they proceed from licentiousness british influence disseminated by the tories or real grievances which admit of redress if the latter why were they delayed till the public mind had become so much agitated if the former why are not the powers of government tried at once it is as well to be without as not to live under their exercise commotions of this sort like snowballs gather strength as they roll if there is no opposition in the way to divide and crumble them—washington to humphreys    october        from mr lees letter—the eastern states consider a commercial connexion with spain as the only remedy for the distresses which oppress their citizens most of which they say flow from the decay of their commerce their delegates have consequently zealously pressed the formation of this connexion as the only effectual mode to revive the trade of their country in this opinion they have been joined by two of the middle states on the other hand virginia has with equal zeal opposed the connexion because the project involves expressly the disuse of the navigation of the mississippi for a given time and eventually they think will sacrifice our right to it the delegation is under instructions from the state on this subject they have acted in obedience to their instructions and myself excepted in conformity to their private sentiments i confess that i am by no means convinced of the justice or policy of our instructions and very much apprehend unless they are repealed by the present assembly the fatal effects of discord in council will be experienced by the united states in a very high degree—new york october   th   some china marked with the order of the cincinnati   while kentucky was seeking to become a separate state its agent before the legislature of virginia john marshall wrote the negotiation which has been opened with spain for ceding the navigation of the mississippi—a negotiation so dishonorable and injurious to america so destructive of the natural rights of the western world—is warmly opposed by this country virginia and for this purpose the most pointed instructions are given to our delegates in congress i persuade myself that this negotiation will terminate in securing instead of ceding that great point on august  d      jay had announced to congress his conclusion that no agreement could be reached with spain without surrendering the claim to the navigation of the mississippi for a limited period an attempt by the southern delegates to take the negotiation out of jays direction failed and full powers were conferred upon him powers that he was seeking to carry into effect when the new government interrupted his diplomatic contentions with gardoqui the intelligence of the grant of these powers however awoke a strong feeling of resentment among the people of the back country a resentment that was directed against the confederation for the legislature of virginia had promptly taken up the cause of the west and insisted upon the claims to their fullest extent resolution    november      it will be to be regretted if a contrariety of sentiments respecting the navigation of the mississippi should impede that harmony and mutual intercourse of interests so essential between nations whose territories border on each other i would fain hope therefore that the true and reciprocal benefits of spain and the united states in this case as well as in all others which may arise between them will be coolly and dispassionately considered before the ultimatum on either side is fixed there is no ground on which treaties can be formed that will be found permanent or satisfactory unless they have these for their basis but however necessary it may be to inculcate this doctrine upon others your excellency i am sure is too much a politician to need the remark and too much a friend to these states to insist upon any measure which the essential interests of your nation or the orders of your court may not have directed incompatible therewith—washington to gardoqui   december        from mr madisons reply—the intelligence from general knox is gloomy indeed but is less so than the colors in which i had it through another channel if the lessons which it inculcates should not work the proper impressions on the american public it will be a proof that our case is desperate judging from the present temper and apparent views of our assembly i have some ground for leaning to the side of hope the vote against paper money has been followed by two others of great importance by one of them sundry petitions for applying a scale of depreciation to the military certificates was unanimously rejected by the other the expediency of complying with the recommendation from annapolis in favor of a general revision of the federal system was unanimously agreed to a bill for the purpose is now depending and in a form which attests the most federal spirit as no opposition has been yet made and it is ready for the third reading i expect it will soon be before the public it has been thought advisable to give this subject a very solemn dress and all the weight which could be derived from a single state this idea will also be pursued in the selection of characters to represent virginia in the federal convention you will infer our earnestness on this point from the liberty which will be used of placing your name at the head of them how far this liberty may correspond with the ideas by which you ought to be governed will be best decided when it must ultimately be determined in every event it will assist powerfully in marking the zeal of our legislature and its opinion of the magnitude of the occasion—richmond november  th   general gates   it is not very clear why henry lee was dropped from the virginia delegation but his supposed heterodoxy on the mississippi question was mentioned as one reason jones the delegate chosen declined to serve and lee was unanimously named in his place   on the mississippi question i am entirely convinced from what i observe here that unless the project of congress for ceding to spain the mississippi for    years can be reversed the hopes of carrying this state into a proper federal system will be demolished—madison to washington   december        in replying to this letter mr madison said i have considered well the circumstances which it confidentially discloses as well as those contained in your preceding favor the difficulties which they oppose to an acceptance of the appointment in which you are included can as little be denied as they can fail to be regretted but i am still inclined to think that the posture of our affairs if it should continue would prevent any criticism on the situation which the contemporary meetings would place you in and wish that at least a door could be left open for your acceptance hereafter in case the gathering clouds should become so dark and menacing as to supersede every consideration but that of our national existence or safety a suspense of your ultimate determination would be nowise inconvenient in a public view as the executive are authorized to fill vacancies and can fill them at any time and in any event three out of seven deputies are authorized to represent the state how far it may be admissible in another view will depend perhaps in some measure on the chance of your finally undertaking the service but principally on the correspondence which is now passing on the subject between yourself and the governor   he had recently been elected as successor to patrick henry   communicating official intelligence of his having been unanimously chosen one of the delegates from virginia for attending a general convention his name was placed at the head of the deputation consisting of seven persons as follows george washington patrick henry edmund randolph john blair james madison george mason and george wythe   to the above letter governor randolph replied although compelled by duty to lay before the council your answer to my notification of your appointment to philadelphia i was happy to find them concurring with me in the propriety of entreating you not to decide on a refusal immediately perhaps the obstacles now in view may be removed before may and the nomination of a successor if necessary at all will be as effectually made some time hence as now perhaps too and indeed i fear the event every other consideration may seem of little weight when compared with the crisis which may then hang over the united states i hope therefore that you will excuse me for holding up your letter for the present and waiting until time shall discover the result of the commotions now prevailing—richmond january  th        the following extract will explain this paragraph and show that the old friend alluded to was general washington himself in case of civil discord said mr humphreys i have already told you it was seriously my opinion that you could not remain neuter and that you would be obliged in selfdefence to take part on one side or the other or withdraw from the continent your friends are of the same opinion and i believe you are convinced it is impossible to have more disinterested and zealous friends than those who have been about your person—new haven november  st   the convention at annapolis   john augustine washington   on the prospect of the happy termination of this insurrection i sincerely congratulate you hoping that good may result from the cloud of evils which threatened not only the hemisphere of massachusetts but by spreading its baneful influence threatened the tranquillity of other states surely shays must be either a weak man the dupe of some characters that are yet behind the curtain or has been deceived by his followers or which may be as likely as any thing perhaps he did not conceive that there was energy enough in the government to bring matters to the crisis they have been pushed it is to be hoped the general court of that state concurred in the report of the committee that a rebellion actually existed this would be decisive and the most likely means of putting the finishing stroke to the business—washington to knox    february        to mr jay he wrote touching upon the same subject more than a month later i would fain try what the wisdom of the proposed convention will suggest and what can be effected by their counsels it may be the last peaceable mode of essaying the practicability of the present form without a greater lapse of time than the exigency of our affairs will allow in strict propriety a convention so holden may not be legal congress however may give it a coloring by recommendation which would fit it more to the taste without proceeding to a definition of the powers this however constitutionally it might be done would not in my opinion be expedient—march  0th   george augustine washington   member of the senate of maryland   a law had been proposed in the legislature of maryland which had passed the house of delegates for issuing bills of credit to the amount of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds to be loaned by the state in various sums the whole redeemable in ten years and drawing interest at six per cent payable annually the senate unanimously refused their assent to this proposition and the differences between the two bodies rose to such a height that the former resolved to adjourn for two months and refer the subject to the people this was deemed a very objectionable course by the senate inasmuch as it was designed to coerce them to act against their judgment and thus deprive them of the freedom and independence which it was a special object of the constitution to secure to that branch of the legislature the objections to this paper emission did not rest wholly on the ground of the inexpediency of a paper currency as such but were derived in part from the peculiar circumstances of the time it was necessary for each state in the confederacy to pay a large portion of the annual requisitions of congress in specie by which alone the large demands for discharging the interest of the national debt could be answered this specie must be collected from the people by taxation an end which would be rather frustrated than promoted by a local paper currency issued on the credit of an individual state especially as the country was already flooded with paper securities that had been rendered indispensable during the war if a state issued paper it could be disposed of only by loans on bonds or mortgages and this paper must be received for taxes or it would immediately depreciate and create new embarrassments but if a state should take its own paper for taxes where was the specie to be found for paying its quota to the national government this paper money must necessarily be exchanged for specie before it could be made available for that object so far from increasing the quantity of metallic currency the effect of a surplusage of paper would be to diminish it and hence the state would be obliged to go abroad to procure it for the purpose of liquidating the claims of congress and to obtain it through a disadvantageous negotiation of its own paper such was the view taken by the opponents to the measure—sparks   a letter of similar import written to knox is printed in sparks in an early letter general knox had spoken somewhat doubtingly but after congress had sanctioned the meeting of a convention and recommended it to the states his impressions seem to have become decided you will have observed said he that congress has passed an act approving the idea of a convention so worded as to include all appointments already made this circumstance will remove all objections to the convention on account of its legality—february   th in reply to the above letter he spoke more fully and more directly to the point as you have thought proper my dear sir to request my opinion respecting your attendance at the convention i shall give it with the utmost sincerity and frankness i imagine that your own satisfaction or chagrin and that of your friends will depend entirely on the result of the convention for i take it for granted that however reluctantly you may acquiesce you will be constrained to accept of the presidents chair hence the proceedings of the convention will more immediately be appropriated to you than to any other person were the convention to propose only amendments and patchwork to the present defective confederation your reputation would in a degree suffer but were an energetic and judicious system to be proposed with your signature it would be a circumstance highly honorable to your fame in the judgment of the present and future ages and doubly entitle you to the glorious republican epithet the father of your country but the men generally chosen being of the first information great reliance may be placed on the wisdom and vigor of their counsels and judgment and therefore the balance of my opinion preponderates greatly in favor of your attendance i am persuaded that your name has had already great influence to induce the states to come into the measure that your attendance will be grateful that your presence would confer on the assembly a national complexion and that it would more than any other circumstance induce a compliance with the propositions of the convention—march   th the following are extracts from letters written by colonel humphreys on the same subject i may then with justice assert that so far from having seen any reason to change my opinion respecting the inexpediency of your attending the convention in may next additional arguments have occurred to confirm me in the sentiment what chance is there then that entire unanimity will prevail should this be the fact however would not the several members as it were pledge themselves for the execution of their system and would not this inevitably launch you again on a sea of politics as you justly observe matters must probably grow worse before they will be better since i had the honor of addressing you last on this subject i have been in the way of hearing the speculations of many different characters on the proposed convention and their conjectures on the part you would act in consequence of your appointment to it i have heard few express any sanguine expectations concerning the successful issue of the meeting and i think not one has judged it eligible for you to attend in this part of the union your not attending will not be considered either by the federal or antifederal party as a dereliction of republicanism the former believe it unimportant or perhaps injurious to the national interests for you to come forward at present the latter look upon the convention as rather intended to subvert than support republicanism and will readily excuse your nonattendance—new haven march   th again i mentioned in my last that i had not conversed with a single character of consideration who judged it proper for you to attend the convention i have now seen several who think it highly interesting that you should be there gouverneur morris and some others have wished me to use whatever influence i might have to induce you to come i could not have promised this without counteracting my own judgment i will not however hesitate to say that i do not conceive your attendance can hazard such personal ill consequences as were to be apprehended before the proposed meeting had been legitimated by the sanction of congress—fairfield april  th      however desirous i am and always shall be to comply with any commands of my country i do not conceive that i can attend the proposed convention to be holden in philadelphia in may next with any degree of consistent conduct for besides the declaration which i made in a very solemn manner when i was about to retire of bidding adieu to all public employment i had just before my appointment as a delegate to this convention written and despatched circular letters to the several state societies of the cincinnati informing them of my intention not to attend the general meeting—which was to take place about the same time and at the same place and assigned reasons which apply as forcibly in the one case as the other to attend the convention under these circumstances might be construed disrespect to a worthier set of men for whose attachment and support on many trying occasions i shall ever put the highest gratitude and affection—washington to madison    march        from governor randolphs letter—i must call upon your friendship to excuse me for again mentioning the convention at philadelphia your determination having been fixed on a thorough review of your situation i feel like an intruder when i again hint a wish that you would join the delegation but every day brings forth some new crisis and the confederation is i fear the last anchor of our hope congress have taken up the subject and appointed the second monday in may next as the day of meeting indeed from my private correspondence i doubt whether the existence of that body even through this year may not be questionable under our present circumstances—richmond march   th   mr madison had taken his seat in congress as a delegate from virginia on the   th of february   the commissioners who had met at annapolis in september      sent a letter to congress accompanied by their address to the several states proposing a convention at philadelphia on the second monday of may these papers were taken up by congress and referred to a committee consisting of one member from each state who reported in favor of recommending to the several legislatures to send delegates   it gives me pleasure to find by your letter that there will be so full a representation from this state if the case had been otherwise i would in emphatical terms have urged again that rather than depend upon my going another might be chosen in my place for as a friend and in confidence i declare to you that my assent is given contrary to my judgment because the act will i apprehend be considered as inconsistent with my public declaration delivered in a solemn manner at an interesting era of my life never more to intermeddle in public matters this declaration not only stands on the files of congress but is i believe registered in almost all the gazettes and magazines that are published and what adds to the embarrassment is i had previous to my appointment informed by a circular letter the several state societies of the cincinnati of my intention to decline the presidency of that order and excused myself from attending the next general meeting at philadelphia on the first monday in may assigning reasons for so doing which apply as well in the one case as in the other add to these i very much fear that all the states will not appear in convention and that some of them will come fettered so as to impede rather than accelerate the great object of their convening which under the peculiar circumstances of my case would place me in a more disagreeable situation than any other member would stand in as i have yielded however to what appeared to be the earnest wishes of my friends i will hope for the best—washington to edmund randolph   april        his diary states that he received the call between four and five oclock in the afternoon of the   th he set out the next morning about

delivered—penn packet quoted in the penn mag   agreed to meet at   oclock on monday   and repaired at the hour of one to the state house   the nomination of washington for this position was made by robert morris instructed by the pennsylvania delegation and seconded by john rutledge the only possible competitor was benjamin franklin making the act of the pennsylvanians all the more graceful there was no opposing ballot and on being conducted to the chair by morris and rutledge washington in a very emphatic manner thanked the convention for the honor they had conferred on him reminded them of the novelty of the scene of business in which he was to act lamented his want of better qualifications and claimed the indulgence of the house towards the involuntary errors which his inexperience might occasion—madison to knox he wrote    may i was much against my wish placed in the chair madison had in april foreseen the fitness of making him the conspicuous figure—to randolph

washington voted in favor of giving to the house of representatives the exclusive originating of moneybills he disapproved and till now voted against the exclusive privilege he gave up his judgment he said because it was not of any material weight with him and was made an essential point with others who if disappointed might be less cordial in other points of real weight   by slow i wish i could add and sure movements the business of the convention advances but to say when it will end or what will be the result is more than i dare venture to do and therefore shall hazard no opinion thereon if something good does not proceed from the session the defects cannot with propriety be charged to the hurry with which the business has been conducted notwithstanding which many things may be forgot some of them not well digested and others from the contrariety of sentiments with which such a body is pervaded become a mere nullity yet i wish a disposition may be found in congress the several state legislatures and the community at large to adopt the government which may be agreed on in convention because i am fully persuaded it is the best that can be obtained at the present moment under such a diversity of ideas as prevail—washington to knox    august        when the president rose for the purpose of putting the question on representation he said that although his situation had hitherto restrained him from offering his sentiments on questions depending in the house and it might be thought ought now to impose silence on him yet he could not forbear expressing his wish that the change proposed might take place it was much to be desired that the objections to the plan recommended might be made as few as possible the smallness of the proportion of representatives had been considered by many members of the convention an insufficient security for the rights and interests of the people he acknowledged that it had always appeared to himself among the exceptionable parts of the plan and late as the present moment was for admitting amendments he thought this of so much consequence that it would give him much satisfaction to see it adopted—madisons debates the change was made this is the only occasion on which any remarks from washington in the convention are recorded   major jackson after burning all the loose scraps of paper which belong to the convention will this evening wait upon the general with the journals and other papers which their vote directs to be delivered to his excellency monday evening   in the midst of hurry and in the moment of my departure from this city i address this letter to you the principal indeed the only design of it is to fulfil the promise i made that i would send to you the proceedings of the federal convention as soon as the business was closed more than this circumstanced as i am at present it is not in my power to do nor am i inclined to attempt it as the enclosure must speak for itself and will occupy your thoughts for some time it is the result of four months deliberation it is now a child of fortune to be fostered by some and buffeted by others what will be the general opinion or the reception of it is not for me to decide nor shall i say any thing for or against it if it be good i suppose it will work its way if bad it will recoil on the framers—washington to lafayette    september        reached chester where we lodged   mr jefferson had sent an extract from an article in the encyclopédie being an account of the society of the cincinnati and washington sent it to knox saying in my present state of mind i can hardly form an opinion whether it will be best to lay the matter before the society as coming from mr jefferson or as from a person of as good information as any in france i must therefore leave it wholly to you to do as you may think most proper—   april        the disturbances in massachusetts have subsided but there are seeds of discontent in every part of this union ready to produce other disorders if the wisdom of the present convention should not be able to devise and the good sense of the people be found ready to adopt a more vigorous and energetic government than the one under which we now live for the present from experience has been found too feeble and inadequate to give that security which our liberties and property render absolutely essential and which the fulfilment of public faith loudly requires vain is it to look for respect from abroad or tranquillity at home vain is it to murmur at the detention of our western posts or complain of the restriction of our commerce vain are all the attempts to remedy the evils complained of by mr dumas to discharge the interest due on foreign loans or satisfy the claims of foreign officers the neglect of doing which is a high impeachment of our national character and is hurtful to the feelings of every wellwisher to this country in and out of it vain is it to talk of chastising the algerines or doing ourselves justice in any other respect till the wisdom and force of the union can be more concentrated and better applied—washington to lafayette    august        i staid two days octo    with general washington at mount vernon about six weeks ago he is in perfect good health and looks almost as well as he did twenty years ago i never saw him so keen for anything in my life as he is for the adoption of the new scheme of government as the eyes of all america are turned towards this truly great and good man for the first president i took the liberty of sounding him upon it he appears to be earnestly against going into public life again pleads in excuse for himself his love of retirement and his advanced age but notwithstanding of these i am fully of opinion he may be induced to appear once more on the public stage of life i form my opinion from what passed between us in a very long and serious conversation as well as from what i could gather from mrs washington on same subject—alexander donald to thomas jefferson    november        a copy of the same letter was sent to benjamin harrison and also to thomas nelson i have to lament that i cannot bring my mind to accord with the proposed constitution the concern i feel on this account is really greater than i can express perhaps mature reflection may furnish me reasons to change my present sentiments into a conformity with the opinions of those personages for whom i have the highest reverence—patrick henry to washington    october      i feel myself deeply interested in every thing that you have had a hand in or that comes from you and am so well assured of the solidity of your judgment and the rectitude of your intentions that i shall never stick at trifles to conform myself to your opinion in the present instance i am so totally uninformed as to the general situation of america that i can form no judgment of the necessity the convention was under to give us such a constitution as it has done if our condition is not very desperate i have my fears that the remedy will prove worse than the disease age makes men often over cautious i am willing to attribute my fears to that cause but from whatever source they spring i cannot divest myself of an opinion that the seeds of civil discord are plentifully sown in very many of the powers given both to the president and congress and that if the constitution is carried into effect the states south of the potomac will be little more than appendages to those to the northward of it you will say that general charges are things without force they are so but in the present instance i do not withhold particular observations because i want them but that i would not tire your patience by entering deeply into a subject before i have heard the reasons which operated in favor of the measures taken after the meeting of the assembly and hearing from those who had a hand in the work the reasons that operated with them in favor of their measures i will then more at large give you my sentiments in the interim i shall only say that my objections chiefly lie against the unlimited powers of taxation and the regulations of trade and the jurisdictions that are to be established in every state altogether independent of their laws the sword and such powers will nay in the nature of things they must sooner or later establish a tyranny not inferior to the triumvirate or centumviri of rome—benjamin harrison to washington   october        on reaching congress madison found certain ideas unfavorable to the constitution were fostered by richard henry lee and dane of massachusetts on the ground first that the convention had exceeded its powers in devising a new frame of government and later that the plan proposed was seriously defective an attempt to amend the constitution in congress was fortunately defeated and congress unanimously resolved to send the report of the convention to the respective legislatures to be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen by the people in each   printed in the pennsylvania packet   october      also in pennsylvania and the federal constitution      edmund randolph his refusal to sign was set down to his chagrin in not being able to carry every thing his own way and to his desire for popularity   colonel mason said in the letter here referred to i take the liberty to enclose to you my objections to the new constitution of government which a little moderation and temper at the latter end of the convention might have removed i am however most decidedly of opinion that it ought to be submitted to the people for that special purpose and should any attempt be made to prevent the calling of such a convention here such a measure shall have every opposition in my power to give it you will readily observe that my objections are not numerous the greater part of the enclosed paper containing reasonings upon the probable effects of the exceptionable parts though in my mind some of them are capital ones—october  th masons objections are printed in ford pamphlets on the constitution     iredells answer may be found in the same collection as the enclosed advertiser contains a speech of mr wilsons as able candid and honest a member as was in convention which will place the most of masons objections in their true point of light i send it to you the republication will if you can get it done be serviceable at this juncture his ipso facto objection does not i believe require any answer every mind must recoil at the idea and with respect to the navigation act i am mistaken if any men bodies of men or countries will enter into any compact or treaty if one of the three is to have a negative control over the other two but granting that it is an evil it will infallibly work its own cure there must be reciprocity or no union which of the two is preferable will not become a question in the mind of any true patriot—washington to david stuart    october      wilsons speech is in ford pamphlets on the constitution       randolph explained his position in a letter to the speaker of the house of delegates  0 october      it was widely circulated in the newspapers and printed in pamphlet form it was reprinted in ford pamphlets on the constitution       david stuart or bushrod washington   i should be glad to know precisely whether i am to expect any and what part of the £ 00 on which you assured me in philadelphia i might absolutely rely and the half of which you informed me in november should be sent to me by your servant in ten days if you could not get the residue i have put the sheriff of this county off three times if he comes again i must if i have no further expectation from you suffer him to make distress as i raised nothing last year for sale and allotted this money for the payment of my taxes    in the morning i shall leave home for a meeting of the directors of the potomack co at the falls of the shenandoah from whence i do not expect to be returned in less than ten days—washington to john francis mercer    january        you give me some reason to hope for the result of your thoughts or experiments on a more eligible system of agriculture—to receive it would afford me pleasure—that the one which is now in general practice if it can be called a system is beyond description ruinous to our lands need no other proof of the fact than the gullied and exhausted state of them which is every where to be met with—but what change is most likely to restore the land with such means as is in our power to apply which will at the same time be productive to the proprietor is the question—and an important one—a question too which admits of no other satisfactory solution than such as is derived from a course of experiments by intelligent and observant farmers who will combine things and circumstances together—theoretical opinions should have no share in the determination and what is good and profitable husbandry in one country may not be so in another—articles which are very saleable in europe might find no market in america and if produced abundantly would answer no other end than to encumber our barns or granaries consequently two things must be engrafted into our plan  st crops which are useful on our farms or saleable in our markets—and  d the intermixing these crops by such relations and with such dressings as will improve instead of exhausting our lands—to effect these is the great desiderata of farming and ought to be the pursuit of every farmer—on this ground every experiment is a treasure—and the authors of them valuable members of society—hence also the societies which are formed for the encouragement and promulgation of these experiments in other countrys have rendered such essential services to the improved and improving states of agriculture in the old world and are so worthy of imitation in the new—washington to charles carter  0 january        the new constitution has as the public prints will have informed you been handed to the people of this state by an unanimous vote of the assembly but it is not to be inferred from hence that its opponents are silenced on the contrary there are many and some powerful ones some of whom it is said by overshooting the marks have lessened their weight be this as it may their assiduity stands unrivalled whilst the friends to the constitution content themselves with a bare avowal of their approbation of it thus stands the matter at present in the state i think nevertheless the voice is for it—washington to hamilton  0 november        with respect to british debts i would fain hope let the eloquence or abilities of any man or set of men be what they may that the good sense and justice of this state will never suffer a violation of the treaty or pass acts of injustice to individuals honesty in states as well as individuals will ever be found the soundest policy—washington to stuart   november        pray if it is not a secret who is the author or authors of publius washington to knox   february      october  0th hamilton sent to washington the first number of the federalist without any intimation as to the authorship for the remaining numbers of publius wrote washington in reply i shall acknowledge myself obliged as i am persuaded the subject will be well handled by the author of them november   th madison sent him seven numbers suggesting that they be republished in virginia and saying that his own degree of connection with the publication was such as to afford a restraint of delicacy from interesting myself directly in the republication elsewhere you will recognize one of the pens concerned in the task there are three in the whole a fourth may possibly bear a part   various methods were devised for raising taxes by receiving substitutes for specie the tax for satisfying the requisitions of congress was allowed to be paid in part by certificates or evidences of claims on the government which had been given during the war the different states had borrowed money and issued loanoffice certificates which bore interest warrants were granted from time to time for the interest on such certificates the state of virginia had passed a law authorizing these warrants to be received into the treasury in payment of certain kinds of taxes—henings statutes vol xii p    tobacco was also received for taxes—ib p     and there was a strong wish on the part of some that other articles of produce should be receivable for the same purpose leaving it to the state to dispose of such commodities and convert them into specie taxes thus paid were called commutable   i thank you for your obliging letter enclosing a paragraph respecting me in mr oswalds paper you have my authority to deny the charge of the sentiments it imputes to me and to declare that in my opinion it is advisable for the people of america to adopt the constitution proposed by the late convention if you should think it expedient to publish this letter i have no objection to its being done—jay to john vaughan   december        this letter contained a series of objections to the constitution as reported by the convention it was circulated widely in the newspapers lee afterwards wrote a series of letters over the signature federal farmer which had great popularity many thousands being printed and sold in the states   a letter of inquiry to richard butler is printed in sparks ix  0  and another to william irvine ix       whether war or peace will be the issue of the dispute between france and england seems as yet undecided if the former we shall certainly get involved unless there is energy enough in government to restrain our people within proper bounds and that the power of the present government is inadequate to accomplish this i believe none will deny—washington to knox  0 january        containing his objections to the new constitution   from the states to the south of it north carolina i have no information that can be relied on except that georgia in appointing a convention have accompanied the act with powers to alter or amend the federal constitution but if a weak state with the indians on its back and the spaniards on its flank do not see the necessity of a general government there must i think be wickedness or insanity in the way the unanimity and generosity with which the county of philadelphia has been offered for the seat of the fæderal government by the land holders thereof gives much weight and merit to the invitation and will probably be an inducement to others to follow the example—washington to samuel powel    january      the georgia convention assembled at augusta on christmas day and on the  d of january fully adopted the new constitution   it appeared afterwards that a copy of the letter had been taken and sent to press without mr carters knowledge the paragraph referred to was the following i thank you for your congratulations on my return from the convention and with what you add respecting the constitution my decided opinion of the matter is that there is no alternative between the adoption of it and anarchy—if one state however important it may conceive itself to be should suppose or a minority of the states that they can dictate a constitution to the majority unless they have the power of administring to good effect administring the ultima ratio they will find themselves deceived all the opposition to it that i have yet seen is i must confess addressed more to the passions than to the reason—and clear i am if another federal convention is attempted the sentiment of the members will be more discordant or less conciliatory than the last—in fine—that they will agree upon no general plan general government is now suspended by a thread i might go farther and say it is really at an end and what will be the consequence of a fruitless attempt to amend the one which is offered before it is tried—or of the delay from the attempt does not in my judgment need the gift of prophecy to predict i am not a blind admirer for i saw the imperfections of the constitution to which i have assisted to give birth but i am fully persuaded it is the best that can be obtained at this day and that it or disunion is before us if the first is our choice when the defects of it are experienced a constitutional door is open for amendments and may be adopted in a peaceable manner without tumult or disorder—washington to charles carter    december      you have undoubtedly seen my sentiments upon the constitution in an extract of a letter written by me to a gentleman in fredericksburg which i find has circulated pretty generally through the papers—i had not the most distant idea of its ever appearing before the publick for altho i have not the least wish or desire to conceal my sentiments upon the subject from any person living yet as the letter containing the paragraph alluded to was written upon several other matters quite foreign to this  intended only for that gentlemans own inspection i did not attend to the manner of expressing my ideas or dress them in the language i should have done if i had the smallest suspicion of them ever coming to the public eye through that channel—washington to lincoln    january      i cannot but think on the whole that it may have been of service notwithstanding the scandalous misinterpretations of it which have been attempted as it has evidently the air of a paragraph to a familiar friend the omission of an argumentative support of the opinion given will appear to no candid reader unnatural or improper—madison to washington  0 february        i am very sorry to find that there is likely to be so powerful an opposition to the adoption of the proposed plan of government with you and i am entirely of your opinion that the business of the convention should be conducted with moderation candor and fairness which are not incompatible with firmness although as you justly observe the friends of the new system may bear down the opposition yet they would never be able by precipitate or violent measures to soothe and reconcile their minds to the exercise of the government which is a matter that ought as much as possible to be kept in view and temper their proceedings—washington to lincoln    january        the intelligence from massachusetts begins to be very ominous to the constitution the antifederal party is reinforced by the insurgents and by the province of maine which apprehends greater obstacles to her scheme of a separate government from the new system than may be otherwise experienced and according to the prospect at the date of the latest letters there was very great reason to fear that the voice of that state would be in the negative the operation of such an event on this state may easily be foreseen its legislature is now sitting and is much divided a majority of the assembly are said to be friendly to the merits of the constitution a majority of the senators actually convened are opposed to a submission of it to the convention the arrival of the absent members will render the voice of that branch uncertain on the point of a convention the decision of massachusetts either way will involve the result in this state the minority in pennsylvania is very restless under their defeat if they can get an assembly to their wish they will endeavour to undermine what has been done there if backed by massachusetts they will probably be emboldened to make some more rash experiment the information from georgia continues to be favorable the little we get from south carolina is of the same complexion—madison to washington  0 january        the fidelity honor and bravery of the troops of your nation to which i have been a witness the enlightened sentiments of patriotism and the delicate feelings of friendship which have actuated great numbers of your compatriots with whom i may boast the happiness of being intimately connected and above all that lively interest which your illustrious monarch and his faithful subjects took in the success of the american arms and the confirmation of our independence have endeared the national character to me formed attachments and left impressions which no distance time or contingency of events can possibly remove though but a private citizen myself and in a measure secluded from the world i am conscious the assertion will be well founded when i venture to affirm that such are the feelings and such the affections of the american people—washington to count de moustier   february        mr griffin sent to him an extract from the statute respecting the duties of the chancellor which runs thus the chancellor is to be the mæcenas or patron of the college such a one as by his favor with the king and by his interest with all other persons in england may be enabled to help on all the college affairs his advice is to be taken especially in all such arduous and momentous affairs as the college shall have to do in england if the college has any petitions at any time to the king let them be presented by their chancellor if the college wants a new president or professor or master let the college senate rely chiefly on his assistance advice and recommendation mr griffin added that neither an oath nor personal attendance was necessary the bishop of london had been the last chancellor upon these facts washington wrote to mr griffin  0 april      influenced by a heartfelt desire to promote the cause of science in general and the prosperity of the college of william and mary in particular i accept the office of chancellor in the same and request you will be pleased to give official notice thereof to the learned body who have thought proper to honor me with the appointment i confide fully in their strenuous endeavors for placing the system of education on such a basis as will render it most beneficial to the state and the republic of letters as well as to the more extensive interests of humanity and religion in return they will do me the justice to believe that i shall not be tardy in giving my cheerful concurrence to such measures as may be best calculated for the attainment of those desirable and important objects   the massachusetts convention closed its session   february      by adopting the constitution washington had written to lincoln on the   th before the news of the result had reached him it is unhappy that a matter of such high importance cannot be discussed with that candor and moderation which would throw light on the subject and place its merits in a proper point of view but in an assembly so large as your convention must be and composed of such various and opposite characters it is almost impossible but that some things will occur which would rouse the passions of the most moderate man on earth lincoln had written on the  th considering the great disorders which took place in this state the last winter and considering the great influence that the spirit which then reigned has had since upon all our operations it may be supposed that we have got through this business pretty well and considering also that when we came together a very decided majority of the convention were against adopting the constitution every exertion will be made to inform the people and to quiet their minds it is very fortunate for us that the clergy are pretty generally with us they have in this state a very great influence over the people and they will contribute much to the general peace and happiness the constitution has labored in massachusetts exceedingly more than was expected the opposition has not arisen from a consideration of the merits or demerits of the thing itself as a political machine but from a deadly principle levelled at the existence of all government whatever the principle of insurgency expanded deriving fresh strength and life from the impunity with which the rebellion of last year was suffered to escape it is a singular circumstance that in massachusetts the property the ability and the virtue of the state are almost solely in favor of the constitution opposed to it are the late insurgents and all those who abetted their designs constituting four fifths of the opposition a few very few indeed wellmeaning people are joined to them the friends of the constitution in that state without overrating their own importance conceive that the decision of massachusetts would most probably settle the fate of the proposition they therefore proceeded most cautiously and wisely debated every objection with the most guarded good nature and candor but took no questions on the several paragraphs and thereby prevented the establishment of parties this conduct has been attended with the most beneficial consequences it is now no secret that on the opening of the convention a majority were prejudiced against it—knox to washington  0 february        to knox he wrote on   march      that the decision of massachusetts would be very influential on the equivocal states    candor and prudence therefore it is to be hoped will prevail and yet i believe there are some characters among us who would hazard every thing rather than cease their opposition or leave to the operation of the government the chance of proving the fallacy of their predictions of it by which their sagacity and foresight might be impeached   the proposed amendments which madison thought were a blemish but are in the least offensive form   a determination to allow his friends in orange county virginia to support his election as a delegate from that county to the state convention which was to decide on the new constitution   at the end of the present month we shall be able to form a tolerable judgment of what may be its fate here as our returns for the delegates to the convention will be known at that time and the characters chosen will be pretty generally decided in their opinions upon the matter before their delegation as that will determine the people in their choice the general tenor of the information which i derive from those gentlemen who call upon me seems to agree in the oppositions losing ground and that nothing is wanting to render the people so favorably disposed towards it as to put the decision beyond a doubt but a proper representation and information upon the subject the opponents are indefatigable in their exertions while the friends to the constitution seem to rest the issue upon the goodness of their cause there will undoubtedly be a greater weight of abilities against the adoption in this convention than in any other we had a right to expect it from the characters who first declared against it here but notwithstanding this my own opinion is as it has ever been that it will be received—washington to lincoln  0 march        the french minister had fancied himself neglected in certain points of etiquette in which his rank as a public functionary was not recognised in such a manner as he expected   a majority of the new hampshire convention was contrary to the expectations of those who had followed her elections opposed to the constitution in a short time a small majority was in its favor but the converts were bound by their instructions and the convention adjourned to suffer them to consult their constituents bancroft asserts that the argument having the greatest weight was that as a small state it would be prudent for new hampshire to wait and see what the other states would do circumstanced as your convention was an adjournment was certainly prudent but it happened very malapropos for this state because the concurrent information from that quarter would have justified the expectation of a unanimity in the convention whereas an account so opposite to every former one having arrived at the very time when the elections were carrying on here gave an opportunity to the opponents of the proposed constitution to hold up to the people its not having been so generally approved of in other states as they had been taught to believe and of consequence prepared them to receive other impressions unfriendly to the government and tending to influence their votes in favor of antifederal characters—washington to john langdon   april        this however i may say that the northern or upper counties are generally friendly to the adoption of the government the lower are said to be generally unfriendly the sentiments of the western parts of the states are not fully known but no means have been left untried to prejudice them against the system every art that could inflame the passions or touch the interests of men have been essayed—the ignorant have been told that should the proposed government obtain their lands would be taken from them and their property disposed of—and all ranks are informed that the prohibition of the navigation of the mississippi their favorite object will be a certain consequence of the adoption of the constitution but notwithstanding these unfair and unjust representations i have the fullest confidence in its being received in this state—washington to lincoln   april      i have not at any moment despaired of this states acceptance of the new constitution since the ratification of maryland by so large and decided a majority the fury of the opposition i believe is spent and the grand push was made at the elections failing of success therein the hopes of its leaders begin to flag and many of them or i am mistaken wish the business was to commence de novo—in which case a different line of march would be taken up by some of them—washington to gouverneur morris   may        the notable volume on pennsylvania and the federal constitution        edited by john bach mcmaster and fred d stone gives a full and complete picture of this factional contest   the convention in the state of maryland   that is the next in which a convention shall assemble after that of maryland   since then i was informed by the honorable james mercer that his brother col john mercer who was at that time july  0th in this town fredericksburg was furnished with documents to prove that genl washington had wrote a letter upon the present constitution to governor johnson of maryland and that governor johnson was so much displeased with the officiousness of genl washington as to induce him to take an active part in bringing about the amendments proposed by a committee of the convention of maryland—dr brooks to david stuart the rumor was of course false but washington sent the extract to governor johnson and enquired whether it was a true statement or the document and interpretation of this matter by colo mercer is the effect of one of those mistakes which he is so liable to fall into—washington to johnson    august        old as i am i rejoice at the high probability and therefore near prospect of a general adoption of the federal constitution this hope leads us on to the use of that system in which the federal voice of pennsylvania stands ready to announce your excellency the first president of the union in this there needs be little hesitation amongst the citizens but not so with you persuaded as i am it will cost you much anxious thought nevertheless if the call of god is manifested to you in a plenary or unanimous call of the people i hope that will obviate every objection if not for the whole term of four years at least for half that time if health admit considering as you will that we were not made for ourselves therefore must not live to ourselves my sole reason for these early hints is that by a divine blessing you may be made instrumental in giving a wise and useful example to successors in more things than what may be merely essential to the office i had like to be so imprudent as to mention a few but am checked not by modesty alone but by former demonstrations that you will have in full view all i mean and much more the more dissipated customs of the age prompted by elevation of rank national dignity and other inflated ideas will but too probably contrast themselves to national economy real dignity and private virtue too—armstrong to washington  0 february        dickinson college at carlyle in pennsylvania   both dr w jones and gabriel jones were reported to be in favor of the constitution   the declaration of henry mentioned in your letter is a proof to me that desperate measures will be his game if report does not more than usually exaggerate mason also is ripening fast for going every length his licentiousness of animadversion it is said no longer spares even the moderate opponents of the constitution—madison to randolph  0 april        to an early applicant for office washington wrote   june      your letter is now before me and requires that i should say something in reply on a subject in which i feel myself more embarrassed and more awkwardly situated than ever i have been before it is but justice to my own feelings to observe that i am conscious i have never been indisposed to do whatever might be in my power in favor of those whose misfortunes had been unavoidably brought upon them without any fault of their own in this predicament i was not a little concerned at an application for employment under a government which does not yet exist and with the administration of which in case it should be adopted and carried into execution it is much more than possible i may never be concerned the chaos of uncertainty in which we are involved and the impropriety of my anticipating events or hazarding opinions would scarcely permit me to touch however slightly on these delicate topics these circumstances i observe had not entirely escaped your attention you will not therefore think it hard that i should mention the subject as peculiarly distressing and perplexing to me delicacy forbids that i should enlarge as to myself as to you i will only add that i know nothing but that your character stands in the fairest light and consequently cannot be actuated by any prejudice against your pretensions i beg sir that the candor and freedom which i have used on this occasion may not be misinterpreted to give you any unintended and unnecessary anxiety or to induce you to believe that i have taken in ill part the application although i thought it to be altogether untimely and improper on the contrary you may rely upon my protestation that i am in every personal consideration with real esteem and friendship c   a thorn this in the sides of the leaders of opposition in this state—should south carolina give us unequivocal opposition of this system the opposition will become feeble yr eight affirmations without a negative carries weight of argument if not of eloquence along with it which might cause even the unerring sister to hesitate—mr chase it is said made a display of all his eloquence—mr mercer discharged his whole artillery of inflammable matter and mr martin did something—i know not what—but presume with vehemence—yet no comments were made—no not one—so the business after a very short session ended and will if i mistake not render yours less tiresome—washington to madison   may        since the elections in this state little doubt is entertained of the adoption of the proposed constitution with us if no mistake has been made with respect to the sentiments of the kentucky members the opponents to it i am informed are now also of this opinion their grand manœuvres were exhibited at the elections and some of them if reports be true were not much to their credit failing in their attempt to exclude the friends to the new government from the convention and baffled in their exertions to effect an adjournment in maryland they have become more passive of late should south carolina now in session decide favorably and the government thereby nine states having acceded get into motion i can scarcely conceive that any one of the remainder or all of them together were they to convene for the purpose of deliberation separated from each other as then they would be in a geographical point of view would incline to withdraw from the union of the other nine—washington to jay    may        a nephew of general washington son of samuel washington   he wrote at the same time to mr hanson as follows i am sorry that the conduct of one of my nephews has been such as to render a complaint to me necessary but i am extremely obliged to you for the communication george has now advanced to that time of life when it is absolutely necessary that his conduct should be regulated by some means or other coercion would be extremely painful to me but if advice remonstrance and gentle methods will not answer the purpose others must be taken enclosed is a letter to him which i have left open for your perusal—may  th   i found contrary to my expectation that not only a very full house had been made on the first day but that it had proceeded to the appointment of the president and other officers mr pendleton was put into the chair without opposition yesterday little more was done than settling some forms and resolving that no question general or particular should be propounded till the whole plan should be considered and debated clause by clause this was moved by colonel mason and contrary to his expectations concurred in by the other side today the discussions commenced in committee of the whole the governor had declared the day of previous amendments passed and thrown himself fully into the federal scale henry and mason made a lame figure and appeared to take different and awkward grounds the federalists are a good deal elated by the existing prospect i dare not however speak with certainty as to the decision kentucky had been extremely tainted is supposed to be generally adverse and every kind of address is going on privately to work on the local interests and prejudices of that and other quarters—madison to washington   june        the pamphlet by jay was an address to the people of the state of new york on the subject of the constitution on receiving a copy washington wrote may   th the good sense forcible observations temper and moderation with which it is written cannot fail i should think of making a serious impression even upon the antifederal mind where it is not under the influence of such local views as will yield to no argument no proofs   from mr jays letter—it gives me pleasure to find that the probability of virginias adopting the proposed constitution rather increases such an event would undoubtedly disarm the opposition it appears by recent advices from charleston that we count on south carolina and the new hampshire delegates assure me that their state will come into the measure there is much reason to believe that the majority of the convention of this state will be composed of antifederal character but it is doubtful whether the leaders will be able to govern the party many in the opposition are friends to union and mean well but their principal leaders are very far from being solicitous about the fate of the union they wish and mean if possible to reject the constitution with as little debate and as much speed as may be it is not however certain that the greater part of their party will be equally decided or rather equally desperate an idea has taken air that the southern part of the state will at all events adhere to the union and if necessary to that end seek a separation from the northern this idea has influence on the fears of the party i cannot find that they have as yet so looked forward to contingent events or even to those the most probable as to have united in or formed any system adapted to them—new york may   th   the citizens of baltimore had recently celebrated the adoption of the constitution in maryland by various demonstrations of joy there was a procession in which the mechanical trades and liberal professions made a brilliant display under their appropriate banners commodore barney performed a conspicuous part on this occasion he had a small boat fifteen feet in length completely rigged and perfectly equipped as a ship which was called the federalist which being mounted on four wheels and drawn by the same number of horses took its place in the procession he commanded the ship and was honored with a crew of captains who at his word and the boatswains pipe went through all the various manœuvres of making and taking in sail to the great delight of the crowded windows doors and balconies by which they passed the ship was immediately followed by all the captains mates and seamen at that time in the port of baltimore it was paraded through all the principal streets of fells point and other portions of the city and finally anchored on the beautiful and lofty bank of the basin which from that occurrence received and has ever since borne the name of federal hill after the pageant was over it was resolved to present the ship to general washington in the name of the merchants and shipmasters of baltimore it was launched and navigated by commodore barney down the chesapeake bay to the mouth of the potomac and thence up the river to mount vernon—life of joshua barney p    —sparks   chagrined at the chances that had prevented the erection of kentucky into a separate state and influenced perhaps by the vote of the kentucky delegates in the virginia convention on the new constitution brown was approached by gardoqui with a hint that the establishment of a separate district without maritime designs would give spain an excuse for devising some plan for adjusting the markets so much needed in some of our possessions—gardoqui to florida blanca    july      it is certain that brown interpreted gardoquis offer as a positive promise i have been assured by him in the most explicit terms that if kentucky will declare her independence and empower some proper person to negotiate with him that he has authority and will engage to open the navigation of the mississippi for the exportation of their produce on terms of mutual advantage but that this privilege can never be extended to them while part of the united states by reason of commercial treaties existing between that court and other powers of europe—brown to george muter  0 july      the proposition was submitted only to a few of browns correspondents and does not appear to have been broached in the kentucky convention of july        tobias lear   a gentleman who had forwarded certain queries to general washington which had been sent to him from scotland by persons proposing to emigrate to america   as the infamy of the conduct of rhode island outgoes all precedent so the influence of her counsels can be of no prejudice there is no other state or description of men but would blush to be involved in a connection with the paper money junto of that anarchy god grant that the honest men may acquire an ascendency before irrevocable ruin shall confound the innocent with the guilty—washington to trumbull  0 july        the leaders in opposition seem to have more extensive views than their adherents and until the latter perceive that circumstance they will probably continue combined the greater number are i believe averse to a vote of rejection some would be content with recommendatory amendments others wish for explanatory ones to settle constructions which they think doubtful others would not be satisfied with less than absolute and previous amendments and i am mistaken if there be not a few who prefer a separation from the union to any national government whatever—jay to washington   congress have deliberated in part on the arrangements for putting the new machine into operation but have concluded on nothing but the times for choosing electors c those who wish to make new york the place of meeting studiously promote delay others who are not swayed by this consideration do not urge despatch they think it would be well to let as many states as possible have an opportunity of deciding on the constitution and what is of more consequence they wish to give opportunities where they can take place for as many elections of state legislatures as can precede a reasonable time for making the appointments and arrangements referred to them if there be too great an interval between the acts of congress on this subject and the next election or next meeting of a state legilature it may afford a pretext for an intermediate summoning of the existing members who are everywhere less federal than their successors hereafter to be elected will probably be this is particularly the case in maryland where the antifederal temper of the executive would render an intermediate and extraordinary meeting of the assembly of that state the more likely to be called on my way through maryland i found such an event to be much feared by the friends and wished by the adversaries of the constitution we have no late news from europe nor any thing from north carolina—madison to washington    july      i am clearly in sentiment with you that the longer the question respecting the permanent seat of congress remains unagitated the greater certainty there will be of its fixture in a central spot—but not having the same means of information and judging that you have it would have been a moot point with me whether a temporary residence of that body at new york would not have been a less likely means of keeping it ultimately from the center being further removed from it than if it was to be at philadelphia because in proportion as you draw it to the center you lessen the inconveniences and of course the solicitude of the southern and western extremities—and when to these are superadded the acquaintances and connections which will naturally be formed—the expenses which more than probably will be incurred for the accommodation of the public officers—with a long train of et ceteras it might be found an arduous task to approach nearer to the axis thereafter—these however are first thoughts and may not go to the true principles of policy which governs in this case—washington to madison    august        on my return home last night i found my nephew lawrence here who said he was afraid to remain at your house and offered to show me some bruises he had received being prepared for it i was going this morning to correct him but he begged so earnestly and promised so faithfully that there should be no cause of complaint against him for the future that i have suspended the punishment the letter which i have written to his brother on the subject is under this cover and open for your perusal he is arrived at that age and size now as to be a fitter subject to be reasoned with than to receive corporal punishment and my primary object in placing these boys with you last was that they at least george should be treated more on the footing of friendship and as companions than as mere schoolboys this i hoped would draw georges attention to objects and conversations that would improve and might contribute in a degree to wean him from boyish amusements the influence of which would extend to lawrence necessary and decent clothes they shall have no cause to complain for the want of and if you sir once a month or oftener would be so obliging as to inspect them and let me know what they need i will take care that they shall be provided a line from one of them lodged at the post signifying their desire of sending things to my tailor to repair will induce the occasional call of a servant which may be sent to town on other business—washington to samuel hanson   august        i believe i told your excellency before i was so little conversant in commercial matters that i desired but small stress might be placed upon my opinions it may be necessary to repeat this observation as an apology for what i am about to say on the commerce between this country and the west india islands i have every reason to wish that this trade might if possible be made reciprocally beneficial of that however i entertain some doubts for hitherto i have thought it of much less importance to the united states than people commonly imagine it to be my reasons for this opinion were first because i could not learn upon inquiry that it turned out much if any to the advantage of those concerned in it and secondly because all or nearly all the produce imported from thence cotton excepted might be considered as articles of luxury the use of which would in a great measure be dispensed with if they were not so easily to be obtained but my greatest reason for supposing the trade detrimental to us was that rum the principal article received from thence is in my opinion the bane of morals and the parent of idleness i have been informed that before the war while all the british islands were wholly open to our vessels and some of those of other nations partly so the trade by enabling the adventurers to make a circuitous remittance to europe was attended with pretty certain but very small profits and that since the war it has been generally a losing speculation even in the state where it has been carried on to the greatest extent and with more economy in the outfits and navigation than elsewhere but it will be asked whether the states which produce horses c for this trade would not be greatly injured in case of its annihilation for want of a market to dispose of that produce i answer that in my judgment it would be better to alter the mode of farming and to raise sheep and black cattle instead of horses there can be no want of sufficient demands for wool and beef nor can i conceive that it would be a difficult affair to substitute the growth of these in the room of less useful articles then i could wish to see the direct commerce with france encouraged to the greatest degree and that almost all the foreign spirits which we consume should consist of the wines and brandies made in that country the use of those liquors would at least be more innocent to the health and morals of the people than the thousands of hogsheads of poisonous rum which are annually consumed in the united states and upon further reflection it seems obvious to me that there are articles enough in france which are wanted here and others in turn produced here which are wanted in france to form the basis of a beneficial extensive and durable commerce—washington to moustier    december        the general terms of this letter were dictated by a wish to say nothing that would be likely to embarrass jeffersons negotiations in france   in writing of these election cabals to james mchenry    july      washington said i think there will be great reason for those who are well affected to the government to use their utmost exertions that the worthiest citizens may be appointed to the two houses of the first congress and where state elections take place previous to this choice that the same principle govern in these also for much will doubtless depend on their prudence in conducting business at the beginning and reconciling discordant dispositions to a reasonable acquiescence with candid and honest measures at the same time it will be a point of no common delicacy to make provision for effecting such explanations and amendments as might be really proper and generally satisfactory without producing or at least fostering such a spirit of innovation as will overturn the whole system i earnestly pray that the omnipotent being who hath not deserted the cause of america in the hour of its extremest hazard will never yield so fair a heritage of freedom a prey to anarchy or despotism   on this topic mr madison wrote you will have seen the circular letter from the convention of this state it has a pestilent tendency if an early general convention cannot be parried it is seriously to be feared that the system which has resisted so many direct attacks may be at last successfully undermined by its enemies it is now perhaps to be wished that rhode island may not accede till this new crisis of danger shall be over some think it would have been better if new york had held out till the operation of the government could have dissipated the fears which artifice had created and the attempts resulting from those fears and artifices—new york august   th this circular letter was sent by the convention of new york to the legislatures of the several states recommending that a new general convention should be called for the purpose of taking into consideration various amendments to the constitution see the letter in the american museum vol iv p     although the virginia convention ratified the constitution by a small majority only yet it did not follow the example of new york in this particular the new york letter was intended to exert an influence on the virginia convention but through an accident was not laid before that body the assembly convened soon afterwards however and adopted strong resolutions to the same effect and sent an application to congress and a circular letter to the several states recommending another general convention—wirts life of patrick henry pp          i take it for granted sir you have concluded to comply with what will no doubt be the general call of your country in relation to the new government you will permit me to say that it is indispensable you should lend yourself to its first operations it is to little purpose to have introduced a system if the weightiest influence is not given to its firm establishment in the outset—hamilton to washington    august        the empress of russia had recently called paul jones into her service to take part in the war against the turks and promised him the rank of rearadmiral mr jefferson said that congress had it once in contemplation to confer on him the rank of admiral which was to date from the time of his taking the serapis and suggested that such a step might still be an act of policy   patrick henry   in reply to general washingtons remarks in his letter of the   th of august respecting the probability of his being elected the first president of the united states colonel hamilton had written as follows i should be deeply pained my dear sir if your scruples in regard to a certain station should be matured into a resolution to decline it though i am neither surprised at their existence nor can i but agree in opinion that the caution you observe in deferring the ultimate determination is prudent i have however reflected maturely on the subject and have come to a conclusion in which i feel no hesitation that every public and personal consideration will demand from you an acquiescence in what will certainly be the unanimous wish of your country the absolute retreat which you meditated at the close of the late war was natural and proper had the government produced by the revolution gone on in a tolerable train it would have been most advisable to have persisted in that retreat but i am clearly of opinion that the crisis which brought you again into public view left you no alternative but to comply and i am equally clear in the opinion that you are by that act pledged to take a part in the execution of the government i am not less convinced that the impression of the necessity of your filling the station in question is so universal that you run no risk of any uncandid imputation by submitting to it but even if this were not the case a regard to your own reputation as well as to the public good calls upon you in the strongest manner to run that risk it cannot be considered as a compliment to say that on your acceptance of the office of president the success of the new government in its commencement may materially depend your agency and influence will be not less important in preserving it from the future attacks of its enemies than they have been in recommending it in the first instance to the adoption of the people independent of all considerations drawn from this source the point of light in which you stand at home and abroad will make an infinite difference in the respectability with which the government will begin its operations in the alternative of your being or not being at the head of it i forbear to mention considerations which might have a more personal application what i have said will suffice for the inferences i mean to draw first in a matter so essential to the wellbeing of society as the prosperity of a newly instituted government a citizen of so much consequence as yourself to its success has no option but to lend his services if called for permit me to say it would be inglorious in such a situation not to hazard the glory however great which he might have previously acquired secondly your signature to the proposed system pledges your judgment for its being such an one as upon the whole was worthy of the public approbation if it should miscarry as men commonly decide from success or the want of it the blame will in all probability be laid on the system itself and the framers of it will have to encounter the disrepute of having brought about a revolution in government without substituting any thing that was worthy of the effort they pulled down one utopia it will be said to build up another this view of the subject if i mistake not my dear sir will suggest to your mind greater hazard to that fame which must be and ought to be dear to you in refusing your future aid to the system than in affording it i will only add that in my estimate of the matter that aid is indispensable i have taken the liberty to express these sentiments and to lay before you my view of the subject i doubt not the considerations mentioned have fully occurred to you and i trust they will finally produce in your mind the same result which exists in mine i flatter myself the frankness with which i have delivered myself will not be displeasing to you it has been prompted by motives which you would not disapprove   these views produced no change in the sentiments of colonel hamilton in regard to the main topic of discussion i feel a conviction said he in reply that you will finally see your acceptance to be indispensable it is no compliment to say that no other man can sufficiently unite the public opinion or can give the requisite weight to the office in the commencement of the government these considerations appear to me of themselves decisive i am not sure that your refusal would not throw every thing into confusion i am sure that it would have the worst effect imaginable indeed as i hinted in a former letter i think circumstances leave no option many of general washingtons correspondents touched upon the same subject and he was made to understand from all quarters that he was designated in the minds of the people as the first chief magistrate under the new constitution in writing from connecticut colonel jonathan trumbull said in the choice of president we have i believe no discordant voice all minds are agreed and every heart exults in the pleasing prospect of having their wishes so nobly gratified in this first great appointment—october   th and governor johnson of maryland wrote we cannot sir do without you and i and thousands more can explain to anybody but yourself why we cannot do without you—october  0th—sparks   our assembly according to different reports has proved itself to be as was apprehended very much under the influence of mr henry the choice of delegates for the senate in congress has fallen upon two gentlemen who are considered to be rather opposed to the new constitution namely richard henry lee and colonel grayson but notwithstanding they have been both of them solicitous to obtain previous amendments colonel henry lee told me lately that mr r h lee had declared to him a few days since he wished to see the government fairly carried into execution and that such alterations only should be adopted as might be found necessary from its errors or defects if these were not the very words the observations i think were of that import a similar sentiment i have been credibly informed has been expressed to more than one person by colonel grayson but the federalists in the assembly as i am given to understand were exceedingly mortified that mr madison should have lost his election by eight or nine votes it is now much dreaded by the same characters that the state which is to be divided into districts for the appointment of representatives to congress will be so arranged as to place a large proportion of those who are called antifederalists in that station—washington to lincoln    november      the accounts from richmond are indeed very unpropitious to federal measures the whole proceedings of the assembly it is said may be summed up in one word—to wit that the edicts of mr henry are enregistered with less opposition by the members of that body than those of the grand monarch are in the parliament of france he has only to say let this be law and it is law—washington to madison    november      on december  d he wrote to stuart that the assembly has displayed the most malignant and if one may be allowed the expression the most unwarrantable disposition towards the new government in all its acts respecting it needs no other evidence than their public records but upon what ground they have undertaken to assert things which the representatives of the people chosen for the express purpose in convention have not authorized them to do lays with the wisdom of the majority of that assembly to explain nor will it redound much to their honor i conceive if in the ultimate appeal to the people there should be as you have intimated seven out of the ten representatives on the fœderal side but excuse me my dear sir when i give it to you as my opinion that you are reckoning without your host as the phrase is not that there may be such a proportion through the state who are friends to the adopted constitution but they either do not see the necessity are too indolent or too much engaged in other matters to come forward or too much disunited among themselves to act in unison whilst those of the other description or i am much mistaken will be formed into one solid phalanx need i go out of this district for proof and again to knox   january      i suppose the two gentlemen appointed by this state are looked upon at the eastward as being included in that class of antifederalists who wish to cause such great and premature amendments as will render the government abortive this idea i have the best reason to believe will be found untrue my belief is founded upon the unequivocal assertions of colonel grayson previous to his election and those of mr richard henry lee posterior to his election it is also pretty well ascertained that if any considerable proportion of the pains shall be taken by the federalists which will be by the antifederalists a majority of the representatives from this state to congress would undoubtedly be composed of the former description at present however it appears very uncertain whether that will be the case or not as several federalists who might in all probability be chosen have on account of their private affairs declined standing as candidates insomuch that it is to be feared in some instances the votes of the advocates for the constitution will be scattered and lost from different channels of information it seemed probable to me even before the receipt of your letter that mr john adams would be chosen vicepresident he will doubtless make a very good one and let whoever may occupy the first seat i shall be entirely satisfied with that arrangement for filling the second office   the singular modesty of this paragraph will be fully understood if the reader will recur to the letter alluded to dated may   d      vol x p    in which general washington replies to a proposition from a high quarter in the army to make him king dr gordon had seen that letter when on a visit to mount vernon after the war and in writing the one to which the above is an answer he requested permission to publish it referring at the same time only to its contents and the circumstances attending it without mentioning its date in speaking of the prospect of general washingtons being the first president of the united states dr gordon said the good of the country is a law that you must submit to when you are called to possess a power in the most honorable way by all professions and ranks of people which to your everlasting honor when known you honestly declined with the truest patriotism when offered in an irregular manner this is a secret which will remain till you are dead unless i could be certain of not offending through the publication of your letter with the suppression of the party to whom it was addressed—london september   th—sparks   it would take up more time than i could well spare to notice the applications which have been made to me in consequence of the new government in answer to as many as i have been at leisure to acknowledge i have invariably represented the delicacy of my situation the impropriety of bringing such things before me the decided resolution i had formerly made and the ardent wishes i still entertain of remaining in a private life you will not then expect that i should commit myself by saying any thing on a subject which has never failed to embarrass and distress me beyond measure whensoever it has been forced upon my consideration—washington to lutterloh   january      if it should be my fate to administer the government i will go into it free from engagements of every kind and nature whatsoever—making when the pretensions of every candidate are brought to view as far as my judgment shall direct me justice and the public good the sole objects of my pursuits—washington to benjamin fishbourn    december      if i should once more be led into the walks of public life it is my fixed determination to enter there not only unfettered by promises but even unchargeable with creating or feeding the expectation of any man living for my assistance to office and sure i am a gentleman of your candor and judgment will approve the resolution first because all offices are to be created by law and consequently are as yet uncertain  dly because the appointment of officers may possibly be left to the heads of departments or in many instances referred to the executives of the respective states and  dly because the ear of the nominator ought to be open to the comments on the merits of each candidate and to be governed primarily by the abilities which are most peculiarly adapted to the nature and duties of the office which is to be filled if unhappily for me it should be my lot to have any share in the execution of the government it will be under the influence of these sentiments and the best knowledge i can obtain of characters that i shall invariably act with respect to appointments and with respect to my conduct as a private man i do verily believe i never shall interfere in the appointment to any office whatsoever beyond a general certificate of facts—washington to samuel hanson   january        last thursday our votes were given in for representatives and for electors of president and vicepresident mr ames is probably chosen for this district he was an active member in our convention and has always distinguished himself as an honest good man i can hardly guess who will represent the other districts except the western one which i think will be represented by mr sedgwick the majority however i am confident will be good members there were great exertions made for mr samuel adams he would probably have carried the vote could the people have been persuaded that he was in heart a federalist our senators are federal indeed mr strong and mr dalton—lincoln to washington  0 december        in the latter end of this summer it was suggested to me that the british court had emissaries in kentucky from the abhorrence and detestation which i have to a british connexion other than that of friends and allies i was induced to keep a lookout and scrutinize the conduct of all strangers my observations soon convinced me of the truth of the case among others lieutenantcolonel connolly late of fort pitt from detroit has visited this district his conduct has alarmed my fears he had some confidential conferences with influential characters he touched the key to fomentations and offered assistance to enable the inhabitants of the western country to seize on the city of new orleans and secure thereby the navigation of the mississippi how his machinations are to be counteracted is the great object i would be more explicit if the conveyance of my letter were more certain it is entrusted to chance i must therefore act with caution relying implicitly on this fact that whatever tends to disturb the peace of united america would distress and injure your tranquillity and repose and that your aiding hand would not be withheld when your countrys cause required it i have ventured to solicit your advice and directions on this interesting subject and would wish to write confidentially to you on this business if by your answer i should conceive myself justified in the attempt should this proposed communication meet your approbation will it not be advisable to invent a cypher for the preservation of that secrecy which the magnitude of the subject requires this being arranged i pledge my honor to give you from time to time a faithful detail of facts—innes to washington    december      in october      john connolly who at one time played quite an important part as an agent of lord dunmore a british recruiting agent and a tory prisoner came from detroit to kentucky ostensibly to look after some lands he claimed but in reality as a messenger from lord dorchester to sound opinion in that region he claimed to be authorized by lord dorchester to offer british aid to an armed force intended to operate against new orleans wilkinson to miro    february      he had conferences with wilkinson thomas marshall george muter and charles scott and returning to detroit gave his employer the impression that a british protectorate might be made useful to check the efforts of spain to win over the kentuckians and that a british party could be fostered in the west miro had an idea that his commercial agreements with wilkinson had established a spanish hold that could not be shaken and gardoqui with his scheme of morgans colony and free port thought he had for the time smoothed over the irritation that the kentuckians had shown at the iron restrictions that the colonial policy of spain had imposed on her trade france also was in possession of a suggestion that might bear fruit to secure from spain the peaceable cession of new orleans and so come between the resentments of the americans and spaniards with a grant of privileges advantageous to all concerned an end was put to this intriguing by washingtons election to the presidency judgment impartiality and decision are conspicuous in every transaction of the president and from the appointments which he has made there is every reason to expect that the different departments will be conducted with justice and ability i consider the appointment of mr jefferson vice jay as a measure favorable to the interests of the western country and calculated to remove those fears which exist respecting the navigation of the river mississippi i am fully convinced that we have nothing to fear on that score from the president this i speak from a knowledge of his sentiments—john brown to harry innes    september        the loan was increased by one hundred pounds to enable washington to go to new york   to another application for office from a foreigner samuel vaughan he wrote from the moment when the necessity had become more apparent and as it were inevitable i anticipated with a heart filled with distress the ten thousand embarrassments perplexities and troubles to which i must again be exposed in the evening of a life already nearly consumed in public cares among all these anxieties i will not conceal from you i anticipated none greater than those that were likely to be produced by applications for appointments to the different offices which would be created under the new government nor will i conceal that my apprehensions have already been but too well justified scarcely a day passes in which applications of one kind or another do not arrive insomuch that had i not early adopted some general principles i should before this time have been wholly occupied in this business as it is i have found the number of answers which i have been necessitated to give in my own hand an almost insupportable burden to me the points in which all these answers have agreed in substance are that should it be my lot to go again into public office i would go without being under any possible engagements of any nature whatsoever that so far as i knew my own heart i would not be in the remotest degree influenced in making nominations by motives arising from the ties of family or blood and that on the other hand three things in my opinion ought principally to be regarded namely the fitness of characters to fill offices the comparative claims from the former merits and sufferings in service of the different candidates and the distribution of appointments in as equal a proportion as might be to persons belonging to the different states in the union without precautions of this kind i clearly foresaw the endless jealousies and possibly the fatal consequences to which a government depending altogether on the good will of the people for its establishment would certainly be exposed in its early stages besides i thought whatever the effect might be in pleasing or displeasing any individuals at the present moment a due concern for my own reputation not less decisively than a sacred regard to the interests of the community required that i should hold myself absolutely at liberty to act while in office with a sole reference to justice and the public good the limits of a letter would not suffice to describe the difficulties which i fear might occur in conferring important offices upon persons however meritorious they may really be who have resided but a little time and are consequently but little known in america a single disgust excited in a particular state on this account might perhaps raise a flame of opposition that could not easily if ever be extinguished for the fact i apprehend will be found to be that there will be at least a hundred competitors for every office of any kind of importance indeed the number of offices will in our economical management of the affairs of the republic be much fewer as i conceive and the pretensions of those who may wish to occupy them much more forcible than many well informed men have imagined at all events so much i can with truth declare that several of the candidates who have already come forward have claims to the public attention and gratitude which cannot be set aside without a palpable act of injustice some of them are men of unquestionable talents who have wasted the flower of their lives in the civil or military service of their country men who have materially injured their properties and excluded themselves from obtaining a subsistence for their families by the professions they were accustomed to pursue there are some i may add who have shed their blood and deserved all that a grateful country has to bestow nor are they in my judgment incapable of reflecting lustre on the most dignified stations i have no conception of a more delicate task than that which is imposed by the constitution on the executive it is the nature of republicans who are nearly in a state of equality to be extremely jealous as to the disposal of all honorary or lucrative appointments perfectly convinced i am that if injudicious or unpopular measures should be taken by the executive under the new government with regard to appointments the government itself would be in the utmost danger of being utterly subverted by those measures so necessary is it at this crisis to conciliate the good will of the people and so impossible is it in my judgment to build the edifice of public happiness but upon their affections your good sense and native candor must serve me as an apology for being thus explicit—march   st   the office wanted was that of naval officer of the district of portsmouth and norfolk col parker had just resigned it to take his seat in congress and the virginia council had chosen capt william lindsay to succeed him   both governor clinton and john jay invited washington to stay with them on his arrival in new york to clinton he replied    march      i shall make it a point to take hired lodgings or rooms in a tavern until some house can be provided because it would be wrong in my real judgment to impose such a burden on any private family as must unavoidably be occasioned by my company and because i think it would be generally expected that being supported by the public at large i should not be burdensome to individuals with respect to the other part of your letter which is expressive of a wish to be apprized of the time of my approach to the city i can assure you with the utmost sincerity that no reception can be so congenial to my feelings as a quiet entry devoid of ceremony be the manner of it what it may   a rough and incorrect draught of a letter—note by washington   the patience of washington was sorely tried by green and subsequently an annual contract appears to have been made between them the last contract was made   october      by which green and his four negro carpenters were to receive £ 0 a month and certain articles of food and green engaged never to be away while his people were at work and he in health or be absent without permission and whereas it too often happens that men regardless of their engagements and of course their reputation when working on standing wages are apt to be idle careless and indifferent to the interest of their employers thereby setting the reverse of good examples it is hereby clearly understood and expressly agreed to by the said thomas green that he will be at his business as soon as it is light and remain thereat until dark when he is in health and when not employed in laying out or marking off work for others that he will labor as faithfully and as effectually as any hand under him as well for the purpose of fulfilling this agreement as for the good example he would set by so doing to those who are under his care and who are not so ignorant knowing this is required of him as not to relax as he relaxes and be idle in proportion as he is idle because all of them have discernment enough to know that no man can with propriety or a good conscience correct others for a fault he is guilty of himself the consequence of which is that indolence and sloth take possession of the whole—agreement in february      washington wrote to pearce his overseer that he had become convinced of greens unfitness to look after his carpenters that only the helpless condition of the family had prevailed to retain him so long and that a change must be made green in september left of his own accord   the day appointed for the assembling of congress was the  th of march but so tardily did the members come together that a quorum of both houses was not formed until the  th of april the stupor or listlessness with which our public measures seem to be pervaded is to me a matter of deep regret indeed it has so strange an appearance that i cannot but wonder how men who are anxious to get into office or who are ever prevailed upon to accept it can reconcile such conduct with their sense of propriety the delay is inauspicious to say the least of it and the world must condemn it—washington to knox  0 april        on the  th of april when the electoral votes were opened it appeared that washington was unanimously chosen president of the united states with marked fitness charles thomson was appointed to notify washington of the result on april   th he reached mount vernon and in a few words performed the object of his mission in reply the presidentelect said i have been accustomed to pay so much respect to the opinion of my fellow citizens that the knowledge of their having given their unanimous suffrages in my favor scarcely leaves me the alternative for an option i cannot i believe give a greater evidence of my sensibility to the honor which they have done me than by accepting the appointment i am so much affected by this fresh proof of my countrys esteem and confidence that silence can best explain my gratitude while i realize the arduous nature of the task which is imposed upon me and feel my own inability to perform it i wish that there may not be reason for regretting the choice for indeed all i can promise is only to accomplish that which can be done by an honest zeal recognizing the importance of being in new york at an early day that there might be no delay in organizing the new executive he set out from mount vernon on april   th recording in his diary about ten oclock i bade adieu to mount vernon to private life and to domestic felicity and with a mind oppressed with more anxious and painful sensations than i have words to express set out for new york in company with mr thomson and colonel humphreys with the best disposition to render service to my country in obedience to its call but with less hope of answering its expectations the incidents attending his journey to the seat of government and his inauguration are so fully described in the volume commemorative of the celebration in      as to make even a summary unnecessary on the  0th of april the oath of office was administered by the chancellor of new york and an address delivered to both houses of congress three contemporary records may be quoted the following account is from a manuscript diary kept by mr lear who was at that time the presidents secretary april  0th—the morning was employed in making such arrangements as were necessary for the ceremonies of the day at nine oclock all the churches in the city were opened and prayers offered up to the great ruler of the universe for the preservation of the president at twelve the troops of the city paraded before our door and soon after the committees of congress and heads of departments came in their carriages to wait upon the president to the federal hall at half past twelve the procession moved forward the troops marching in front with all the ensigns of military parade next came the committees and heads of departments in their carriages next the president in the state coach and colonel humphreys and myself in the presidents own carriage the foreign ministers and a long train of citizens brought up the rear about two hundred yards before we reached the hall we descended from our carriages and passed through the troops who were drawn up on each side into the hall and senatechamber where we found the vicepresident the senate and house of representatives assembled they received the president in the most respectful manner and the vicepresident conducted him to a spacious and elevated seat at the head of the room a solemn silence prevailed the vicepresident soon arose and informed the president that all things were prepared to administer the oath whenever he should see fit to proceed to the balcony and receive it he immediately descended from his seat and advanced through the middle door of the hall to the balcony the others passed through the doors on each side the oath was administered in public by chancellor livingston and the moment the chancellor proclaimed him president of the united states the air was rent by repeated shouts and huzzas—god bless our washington long live our beloved president we again returned into the hall where being seated as before for a few moments the president arose and addressed the two branches of congress in a speech which was heard with eager and marked attention after the president had finished his speech we proceeded from the senatechamber on foot to st pauls church in the same order that we had observed in our carriages where the bishop read prayers suited to the occasion we were then met at the church door by our carriages and we went home in the evening there was a display of most beautiful fireworks and transparent paintings at the battery the president colonel humphreys and myself went in the beginning of the evening in the carriages to chancellor livingstons and general knoxs where we had a full view of the fireworks we returned home at ten on foot the throng of people being so great as not to permit a carriage to pass through it fisher ames noted i was present in the pew with the president and must assure you that after making all deductions for the delusion of ones fancy in regard to characters i still think of him with more veneration than for any other person time has made havoc upon his face that and many other circumstances not to be reasoned about conspire to keep up the awe which i brought with me he addressed the two houses in the senatechamber it was a very touching scene and quite of a solemn kind his aspect grave almost to sadness his modesty actually shaking his voice deep a little tremulous and so low as to call for close attention added to the series of objects presented to the mind and overwhelming it produced emotions of the most affecting kind upon the members senator mcclay gave another account this great man was agitated and embarrassed more than he was by the levelled cannon or pointed musket he trembled and several times could scarce make out to read though it must be supposed he had often read it before he put part of the fingers of his left hand into the side of what i think the tailors call the fall of the breeches changing the paper into his left right hand after some time he then did the same thing with some of the fingers of his right hand when he came to the words all the world he made a flourish with his right hand which left rather an ungainly impression i for my part wished all set ceremony in the hands of the dancing masters and that this first of men had read off his address in the plainest manner without ever taking his eyes from the paper for i felt hurt that he was not first in every thing he was dressed in deep brown with metal buttons with an eagle on them white stockings a bag and sword   the form of these speeches was that used by the colonial governors in addressing the colonial assemblies but was later set aside in favor of a single message to which no replies by the respective houses of congress were given the president had consulted madison on the replies notwithstanding the conviction i am under of the labor which is imposed upon you by public individuals as well as public bodies—yet as you have begun so i would wish you to finish the good work in a short reply to the addresses of the house of representatives which i now inclose that there may be an accordance in this business thursday    oclock i have appointed to receive the addresses—the proper plan is with the house to determine—as the first of every thing in our situation which serve to establish a precedent it is devoutly wished on my part that these precedents may be fixed on true principles—washington to madison   may        similar sentiments were expressed in a letter to general wayne my greatest apprehension at present is that more will be expected from me than i shall be able to perform all that an honest zeal can dictate for the advancement of the interests of our country will however be cheerfully and perseveringly attempted—may  th and to general schuyler it is only from the assurances of support which i have received from the respectable and worthy characters in every part of the union that i am enabled to overcome the diffidence which i have in my own abilities to execute my great and important trust to the best interest of our country an honest zeal and an unremitting attention to the interests of the united states are all that i dare promise—may  th and again to mr jones the numerous and friendly congratulations which i have received from respectable characters in every part of the union are truly pleasing to me not only on account of their discovering a warm attachment to my person but because they convey the most flattering idea of the good dispositions of the people in the several states and the strongest assurances of support to the government it affords me likewise no small satisfaction to find that my friends have done justice to the motives which again brought me into public life under all these circumstances i shall feel a degree of confidence in discharging the duties of my administration with which a consciousness alone of the purity of my intentions could not have inspired me—may   th to robert r livingston after stating the principles which he had adopted for regulating his conduct in regard to appointments he wrote the delicacy with which your letter was written and your wishes insinuated did not require me to be thus explicit on this head with you but the desire which i have that those persons whose good opinion i value should know the principles on which i mean to act in this business has led me to this full declaration and i trust that the truly worthy and respectable characters in this country will do justice to the motives by which i am actuated in all my public transactions—may   st   mrs washington did not arrive in new york till may   th   the queries were also sent to mr jay   the widow of general wooster who died of the wounds he received in an action with the enemy when the british made an incursion to danbury in april        in no respect was washingtons anxious care more fully shown than in seeking the proper persons for the offices in the new government that part of the presidents duty which obliges him to nominate persons for office he wrote to joseph jones    may      is the most delicate and in many instances will be to me the most unpleasing for it may frequently happen that there will be several applicants for the same office whose merits and pretensions are so nearly equal that it will almost require the aid of supernatural intuition to fix upon the right i shall however in all events have the consolation of knowing that i entered upon my office unconfined by any engagements and uninfluenced by any ties and that no means in my power will be left untried to find out and nominate those characters who will discharge the duties of their respective offices to the best interests and highest credit of the american union that he was sincere in this wish there will be abundant evidence afforded in these volumes and that he was successful in his policy is proved by the frequent reference to his administration as the type of a true and honest civil service conversing on the subject of these appointments revenue lately with the p i mentioned two principles which i had the pleasure to hear him approve of the first that state officers in similar lines who had behaved well deserved preference in the service of the united states and  dly that having discharged these duties undivided now that they become divided the same officers were entitled to the best he assigned some strong reasons in support of both these ideas—richard henry lee to —   june      you cannot doubt my wishes to see you appointed to any office of honor or emolument in the new government to the duties of which you are competent but however deserving you may be of the one you have suggested your standing at the bar would not justify my nomination of you as attorney to the federal district court in preference of some of the oldest and most esteemed general court lawyers in your own state who are desirous of this appointment my political conduct in nominations even if i were uninfluenced by principle must be exceedingly circumspect and proof against just criticism for the eyes of argus are upon me and no slip will pass unnoticed that can be improved into a supposed partiality for friends or relations—washington to bushrod washington    july        moustiers commercial ideas are probably neither illiberal nor unfriendly to this country the contrary has been supposed—madison to jefferson    may        in addition to what i wrote to you formerly on the subject of a loan i now inform you and desire that this letter which conveys the information may be destroyed so soon as it is read that my utmost exertions were ineffectually used to borrow a sum of money even at a high interest and for me on disadvantageous terms to comply with contracts of my own before i left virginia having made this communication it is unnecessary to adduce further proof of my inability to comply with the request which is contained in your letter of the   th instant—washington to carey    may        the secretaries of the several executive departments under the new government were not appointed till september in the meantime the usual business of the departments was transacted by the officers who had charge of them when the old government expired mr jay continued to fill the office of secretary of foreign affairs till mr jefferson entered upon its duties in march    0 the name of the department was changed by law to that of the department of state and its head was thenceforward called secretary of state general knox acted as secretary of war till his new appointment to the same post on the   th of september      the affairs of the treasury were administered by a board consisting of samuel osgood walter livingston and arthur lee these gentlemen retained their places till september   th when hamilton was appointed secretary of the treasury the reason why the appointments were so long delayed was that the laws instituting the departments and fixing the salaries of the officers were not sooner passed by congress   a copy of the same letter was sent to the secretary of war and to the board of the treasury and a similar one to ebenezer hazard postmastergeneral   an anecdote characteristic of washington is related by professor mcvickar in his narrative of dr bards life respecting an incident that happened in the course of his illness it was a case of anthrax so malignant as for several days to threaten mortification during this period dr bard never quitted him on one occasion being left alone with him general washington looking steadfastly in his face desired his candid opinion as to the probable termination of his disease adding with that placid firmness which marked his address do not flatter me with vain hopes i am not afraid to die and therefore can bear the worst dr bards answer though it expressed hope acknowledged his apprehensions the president replied whether tonight or twenty years hence makes no difference i know that i am in the hands of a good providence —life of dr samuel bard p       he seems to have made visits of ceremony before his inauguration   a report had gone abroad that the vicepresident never appeared publicly except with a coach and six horses which dr stuart said was creating much excitement in virginia and was put forward by the opponents of the constitution as a proof of the monarchical tendency of the government   this paragraph relates to a scheme which had lately been before congress respecting the titles by which the high officers of government should be addressed nothing could equal the ferment and disquietude said dr stuart occasioned by the proposition respecting titles as it is believed to have originated with mr adams and mr lee they are unpopular to an extreme the history of the proceedings on this subject is briefly as follows a committee was appointed by the senate april   d to consider and report what style or titles it will be proper to annex to the offices of president and vicepresident of the united states richard henry lee was chairman the next day a committee was appointed by the house of representatives to confer with the committee of the senate on the same subject this joint committee reported that it is improper to annex any style or title to the respective styles or titles of office expressed in the constitution the report was unanimously adopted by the house but was not agreed to by the senate the question was then taken in that body whether the president of the united states should be addressed by the title of his excellency which passed in the negative and the subject was referred to another committee of which lee ellsworth and dr johnson were members a proposal to the house of representatives to confer with this second committee brought on a debate which was conducted with considerable warmth and was stopped by the previous question which set the subject aside and it was never again brought forward in that house the committee of the senate reported however that it was proper to style the president his highness the president of the united states of america and protector of the liberties of the same in the meantime the house of representatives had addressed the president in reply to his inaugural speech as president of the united states and the senate for the purpose of preserving harmony with the other house resolved may   th to follow its example in an address about to be made to the president and postponed the report of their committee agreeing at the same time in the resolve that from a decent respect for the opinion and practice of civilized nations whether under monarchical or republican forms of government whose custom is to annex titles of respectability to the office of their chief magistrate and that in intercourse with foreign nations a due respect for the majesty of the people of the united states may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity the senate have been induced to be of opinion that it would be proper to annex a respectable title to the office of the president of the united states with this declaration of their opinion the senate allowed the matter to rest and it was never afterwards revived senator mcclay was one of the most active opponents to titles and has left the fullest record of the contest on this question while the subject was thus solemnly treated by congress it caused much excitement throughout the country it was discussed in the gazettes but the advocates of titles found few supporters by these it was affirmed however that titles were as harmless as they were necessary and that the president as representing the majesty of the people might even be styled his majesty without reasonable offence to republican ears others said that his excellency was not a proper title because it was applied to officers below him particularly in the diplomatic department in some of the newspapers the president was called his highness the presidentgeneral the senate was denominated most honorable and the same epithet was applied to the members of that body for instance it was published that the most honorable rufus king and the most honorable philip schuyler were appointed senators and when mrs washington came to new york she was accompanied by the lady of the most honorable robert morris the representatives and even the secretaries of the executive departments were favored with no higher title than honorable in the debates on the subject mr clymer said that as soon as a man is selected for the public service his fellow citizens with a liberal hand showered down titles upon him either excellency or honorable he would venture to affirm there were more honorable esquires in the united states than in all the world besides there appears not to have been a single member of the house of representatives in favor of titles the habit of bestowing them gradually subsided it would be ludicrous at the present day to affix the superlative epithet to a senators name and not less so to use the anticlimax honorable esquire which prevailed during the revolution general washington was scrupulous to give every man his official appellation but was opposed to all titles as marks of rank in a republican government a person sent to him a manuscript treatise on heraldry the publication of which was suppressed by his advice as he thought its tendency would be hostile to the sentiments of the people and unfavorable to liberty titles to both the president and vicepresident were formally and unanimously condemned by a vote of the house of representatives this i hope will shew to the friends of republicanism that our new government was not meant to substitute either monarchy or aristocracy and that the genius of the people is as yet averse to both—madison to jefferson   may      the address is purged you will observe of all titles whatsoever except the constitutional one this point had been previously determined by a report from a joint committee originated by the senate for the purpose of settling what or whether any titles should be annexed to the president and vicepresident the report was unanimously agreed to by the house of representatives previous to the address i am sorry to find that the senate do not concur in this principle of dignified simplicity they have disagreed to the report of the joint committee and have proposed another consultation on the subject the house of representatives will assuredly adhere to the first determination the friends of titles in the other branch are headed by the vicepresident who is seconded with all the force and urgency of natural temper by r h lee—madison to pendleton  0 may      the senate used no title in its answer an imitation that was extorted    the projected title was his highness the president of the united states and protector of their liberties had the project succeeded it would have subjected the president to a severe dilemma and given a deep wound to our infant government—madison to jefferson    may      honorary titles lead to permanent distinctions and hereditary establishments these to monstrous taxes and both to the ruin of liberty—boston gasette   the first appointment submitted to the senate by the president was that of william short to be in charge of the american legation in paris during the absence of thomas jefferson the minister under the confederation this nomination was made on june   th and confirmed on the   th on august  d a long list of appointments in the revenue service was submitted and the senate acted upon them rejecting but one—the nomination of benjamin fishbourn as naval officer for the port of savannah in sending in the name of lachlan mcintosh as his substitute washington showed that the rejection had not a little touched him permit me to submit to your consideration whether on occasions where the propriety of a nomination appears questionable to you it would not be expedient to communicate that circumstance to me and thereby avail yourselves of the information which led me to make them and which i would with pleasure lay before you and he proceeded to give his reasons for naming fishbourn—message   august        a motion had been made in the senate on the  d of august proposing that in place of determining upon a nomination by ballot as settled by a rule adopted june   th some other mode should be adopted like a viva voce vote but the motion was lost on the  th of august another motion was made that it is the opinion of the senate that their advice and consent to the appointment of officers should be given in the presence of the president this motion was postponed to the next day when it was ordered that mr izard mr king and mr carroll be a committee to wait on the president of the united states and confer with him on the mode of communication proper to be pursued between him and the senate in the formation of treaties and making appointments to offices the committee accordingly waited on the president and had the conference mentioned in the above letter in regard to treaties a practice was at first begun which was not pursued on the   st of august the following message was sent to the senate the president of the united states will meet the senate in the senate chamber at halfpast eleven oclock tomorrow to advise with them on the terms of the treaty to be negotiated with the southern indians he accordingly took his seat in the senate attended by general knox the secretary of war for two days in succession when the outlines of a treaty proposed by the secretary were discussed but this practice being found inconvenient and subject to various objections particularly in regard to treaties with foreign powers was soon discontinued—storys commentaries vol iii p       on the   th the following nominations for the several offices in the western territory were sent to the senate for governor arthur st clair for secretary winthrop sergeant judges samuel holden parsons john cleve symmes and william barton   in senate august   st      the committee appointed to wait on the president of the united states and confer with him on the mode of communication proper to be pursued between him and the senate in the formation of treaties and making appointments to offices reported which report was agreed to as follows resolved that when nominations shall be made in writing by the president of the united states to the senate a future day shall be assigned unless the senate shall direct otherwise for taking them into consideration that when the president of the united states shall meet the senate in the senatechamber the president of the senate shall have a chair on the floor be considered as at the head of the senate and his chair shall be assigned to the president of the united states that when the senate shall be convened by the president of the united states at any other place the president of the senate and senators shall attend at the place appointed the secretary of the senate shall also attend to take the minutes of the senate that all questions shall be put by the president of the senate

english education and his ability and ambition were great and sharpened by a resentment against georgia which had confiscated his estates in the late war on the signing of peace at paris he had proposed a treaty of alliance and commerce to the spanish governor of pensacola arthur oneal or oneil thus virtually seeking the protection of spain and even hinting at a separation of the western territory now rapidly being colonized from the atlantic states from the confederation—gayarre louisiana under the spanish domination         a treaty was made and the profits of the resulting commerce

shall be called forth for the protection of that frontier a condition of war and the unfulfilled threat of congress were forced upon the attention of washington in august      the president took counsel of congress in the matter and benjamin lincoln cyrus griffin and david humphreys were named commissioners to treat with the southern indians the first great object of their mission being to effect peace between georgia and the creeks on your success materially depends the internal peace of georgia and probably its attachment to the general government of the united states every effort was to be made to detach mcgillivray from his spanish alliance and make him a warm friend of the united states the full instructions may be found in american state papers indian affairs i    the mission ended in a total failure so far as the creeks were concerned and the commissioners laid the entire blame on mcgillivray a pensioner of spain who seemed to be influenced by his private interests for in august    0 when he with some of the kings and head men of the creeks came to new york and entered into negotiations for a treaty the trade problems were the most difficult to solve this trade of the creeks amounting to £  000 a year was entirely in the hands of british merchants who enjoyed special privileges in spanish ports as the trade of the indians is a main mean of their political management it is therefore obvious that the united states cannot possess any security for the performance treaties with the creeks while their trade is liable to be interrupted or withheld at the caprice of two foreign powers hence it becomes an object of real importance to form new channels for the commerce of the creeks through the united states—washingtons message to the senate   august

should have died two years ago but though those years have been spent in excruciating pain i am pleased that i have lived them since they have brought me to see our present situation i am now finishing my eightyfourth year and probably with it my career in this life but in whatever state of existence i am placed hereafter if i retain any memory of what has passed here i shall with it retain the esteem respect and affection with which i have long been my dear friend c   as early as july  0th washington had talked with cyrus griffin of the virginia delegation on the judiciary and customs appointments in virginia and appeared anxious to know if edmund pendleton george wythe lyons or john blair would prefer a federal to a state appointment edmund randolph was also suggested but no mention was made of particular offices for the person to be named late in july or early in august the president wrote to madison that he had determined to nominate mr blair and colonel pendleton as associate and district judges and randolph as attorneygeneral mr randolph in this character i would prefer to any person i am acquainted with of not superior abilities from habits of intimacy with him pendleton declined to serve and cyrus griffin was named in his place   randolphs private affairs and his incompleted revision of the laws of the state were urged as reasons for delaying an acceptance of the office in announcing their appointments to the associate judges of the supreme court washington wrote  0 september      considering the judicial system as the chief pillar upon which our national government must rest i have thought it my duty to nominate for the high offices in that department such men as i conceived would give dignity and lustre to our national character and i flatter myself that the love which you bear to our country and a desire to promote general happiness will lead you to a ready acceptance of the enclosed commission which is accompanied with such laws as have passed relative to your office five days later he inclosed a commission to john jay appointing him chief justice and added in nominating you for the important station which you now fill i not only acted in conformity to my best judgment but i trust i did a grateful thing to the good citizens of these united states and i have a full confidence that the love which you bear to our country and a desire to promote general happiness will not suffer you to hesitate a moment to bring into action the talents knowledge and integrity which are so necessary to be exercised at the head of that department which must be considered as the keystone of our political fabric   mr jefferson arrived at norfolk on the   d of november and at eppington in chesterfield county on his way to monticello

to which it had been his intention to return but he added it is not for an individual to choose his post you are to marshal us as may be best for the public good and it is only in case of its being indifferent to you that i would avail myself of the option you have so kindly offered in your letter if you think it better to transfer me to another post my inclination must be no obstacle nor shall it be if there is any desire to suppress the office i now hold or to diminish its grade in either of these cases be so good as to signify to me by another line your ultimate wish and i shall conform to it accordingly if it should be to remain at new york my chief comfort will be to work under your eye my only shelter the authority of your name and the wisdom of measures to be dictated by you and implicitly executed by me whatever you may please to decide i do not see that the matters which have called me hither will permit me to shorten the stay i originally asked that is to say to set out on my journey northward till the month of march as early as possible in that month i shall have the honor of paying my respects to you in new york—december   th on this subject mr madison wrote to the president as follows a few days before i was allowed to set out for new york i took a ride to monticello the answer of mr jefferson to the notification of his appointment will no doubt have explained the state of his mind on the subject i was sorry to find him so little biassed in favor of the domestic service allotted to him but was glad that his difficulties seemed to result chiefly from what i take to be an erroneous view of the kind and quantity of business annexed to that which constituted the foreign department he apprehends that it will far exceed the latter which has of itself no terrors to him on the other hand it was supposed and i believe truly that the domestic part will be very trifling and for that reason improper to be made a distinct department after all if the whole business can be executed by any one man mr jefferson must be equal to it all whom i have heard speak on the subject are remarkably solicitous for his acceptance and i flatter myself that they will not in the event be disappointed—georgetown january  th    0   morris in his first interview with the duke of leeds on march   th outlined the wishes of the president as given in this letter and was well

hampshire on the   st having been attended nearly the whole distance by military escorts which were prepared to receive him at different points on the route in all the principal towns also he was greeted with public addresses the ringing of bells entertainments and every demonstration of joy from the whole body of the people he returned through the country from portsmouth to hartford by a different road from the one he had before taken and arrived in new york on the   th of november—sparks his diary of this journey has been printed under the editorship of benson j lossing   this visit to boston occasioned a somewhat amusing exchange of words between the president and governor hancock on a point of etiquette on october   st hancock wrote offering his house for washingtons use during his visit and informing him of the measures taken for his reception as governor of the commonwealth i feel it to be my duty to receive your visit with such tokens of respect as may answer the expectations of my constituents and may in some measure express the high sentiments of respect they feel towards you i have therefore issued orders for proper escorts to attend you and colonel hall deputy adjutantgeneral will wait upon you at worcester and will inform you of the disposition i have made of the troops at cambridge under the command of general brooks and request that you would be so obliging as to pass that way to the town where you will receive such other tokens of respect from the people as will serve further to evince how gratefully they recollect your exertions for their liberties and their confidence in you as president of the united states of america the gentlemen of the council will receive you at cambridge and attend you to town to this washington replied from brookfield october   d outlining his progress and adding i am highly sensible of the honor intended me but could my wish prevail i should desire to visit your metropolis without any parade or extraordinary ceremony from a wish to avoid giving trouble to private families i determined on leaving new york to decline the honor of any invitation to quarters which i might receive while on my journey and with a view to observe this rule i had requested a gentleman to engage lodgings for me during my stay at boston i beg your excellency to be persuaded of the grateful sense which i entertain of the honor you intended to confer on me and i desire to assure you of the respectful regard with which i am c hancock regretting that his house could not be accepted then requested that washington should arrive in boston some hours before he had planned and that he and the gentlemen of his suite should dine with hin en famille on saturday at any hour that the circumstances of the day will admit the arrangements of the receiving committee allowed the first to be done and the president accepted not only did some differences between the governor and the civic committee occur to delay matters detailed in a letter of benjamin russell printed in sparks washington x     but the governor insisted that the president should make the first visit upon him learning of this washington went direct to the house prepared for him a boardinghouse on the corner of tremont and court streets kept by joseph ingersoll and it is said sent major jackson to the governor with a message that if hancocks health permitted him to receive company it would admit of his visiting the president in the evening the friends of the governor induced him to recede from his position which led to the following interchange of notes governor hancock    october george washington governor hancock to president washington sunday    october half past twelve oclock the governors best respects to the

whether his hancocks humility would be gratified with the sight of his superior   washingtons letter to harrison is printed by sparks x      on this point mr mchenry answered i have had a long conversation with mr paca i have every reason to say that he will make every exertion in his power to execute the trust in the most unexceptionable manner i believe also that the appointment will be highly gratifying to him and i think it may have political good consequences—annapolis december  0th mr johnson has as you supposed declined the appointment of judge to the district of maryland and i have lately appointed mr paca to fill that office mr thomas whom you recommend for that place undoubtedly possesses all those qualifications which you have ascribed to him and so far as my own knowledge of that gentleman extends he is justly entitled to the reputation which he sustains but in appointing persons to office and more especially in the judicial department my views have been much guided to those characters who have been conspicuous in their country not only from an impression of their services but upon a consideration that they had been tried and that a readier confidence would be placed in them by the public than in others perhaps of equal merit who had never been proved upon this principle mr paca certainly stands prior to mr thomas although the latter may possess in as high a degree every qualification requisite in a judge—washington to william fitzhugh    december        in reply mr randolph said you may be assured that mr wythe neither wished nor expected to be the successor of mr pendleton—december   th again i found a fortunate moment for a conversation with mr wythe he repeated what i wrote to you in answer to your favor of the  0th ultimo indeed he declared himself happy in believing that he held a place in your esteem and that he was confident you had looked towards him with every partiality which he could wish nay without going into the detail of our discourse i am convinced from his own mouth that the knowledge of his present situation is considered by him as the only reason of a seat on the bench not being tendered to him—richmond december   d   at the first convention in north carolina the constitution was not ratified but at a second convention held in november      it was adopted by a majority of more than two to one the vote being one hundred and ninetythree in the affirmative and seventyfive in the negative the legislature of rhode island during the session in september had sent an address to the president the senate and the house of representatives of the eleven united states of america in congress assembled in which were contained explanations of the course pursued by that state in not adopting the constitution the address was on the whole conciliatory and gave indications that the tone of opposition was somewhat subsiding in rhode island and would in no event interrupt the harmony of the union after stating the grounds upon which the objections of rhode island had mainly rested the governor closes his communication in behalf of the legislature as follows we feel ourselves attached by the strongest ties of friendship kindred and of interest to our sister states and we cannot without the greatest reluctance look to any other quarter for those advantages of commercial intercourse which we conceive to be more natural and reciprocal between them and us—sparks nearly six months later washington was given an opportunity of acknowledging the ratification by rhode island of the constitution having now attained the desirable object of uniting under one general government all those states which were originally confederated we have a right to expect with the blessing of a divine providence that our country will afford us all those domestic enjoyments of which a free people only can boast and at the same time secure that respectability abroad which she is entitled to by nature and from circumstances since the bond of union is now complete and we once more consider ourselves as one family it is much to be hoped that reproaches will cease and prejudices be done away for we should all remember that we are members of that community upon whose general success depends our particular and individual welfare and therefore if we mean to support the liberty and independence which it has cost us so much blood and treasure to establish we must drive far away the demon of party spirit and local reproach—washington to governor arthur fenner   june    0   governor pinckneys letter related to a treaty with spain and with the southern indians as to the former he said upon the conclusion of peace i believe it was the intention of that court to enter into a treaty of amity and commerce with us to be our friends and to do every thing in their power to promote the intercourse but they mistook the means for instead of forming a treaty upon the terms which would have ensured a reciprocity of benefits they thought the best way to remove every future ground of difference to prevent our becoming dangerous neighbors and to keep us at a distance was to propose the surrender of a right as degrading to the honor as it would have been injurious to the interests of the union i happened to be in congress at the time the proposal was brought forward through the then secretary mr jay having more leisure or having more maturely considered the offer i was requested by the opponents to prepare an answer to the reasons which mr jay offered in support of mr gardoquis proposals this i did and being afterwards desired by many of the southern members to furnish them with copies i had a few printed which were confidentially delivered to some of my friends for their information upon a subject which at that time very much engaged the attention of the public the court of spain being defeated in this measure have appeared to me entirely to change their ground the original and i believe the only reason of spains anxiety to conclude a treaty with us was to secure her american continental possessions from being at any time the object of invasion or insult from the southern or more probably the western inhabitants of the union they ever dreaded the settlement of the western territory and looked forward to the time when it would become necessary for its inhabitants to use the mississippi as a period very likely to produce those uneasinesses which would perhaps end in the invasion of their dominions had they at first proposed a solid and reciprocally beneficial treaty it would have prevented or at least postponed for a number of years any danger of this sort but having as i have already observed wrongly conceived of the means of effecting it and being foiled in their first attempt they have now changed their ground they are endeavoring by every exertion in their power to attach not only the southern indians but as many as they possibly can of the inhabitants of the western territory closely to their interest—charleston december   th      these views respecting the disposition of the spanish court towards the united states at the time of the general treaty of peace may at least be doubted the refusal of that court to receive mr carmichael in the character of chargé de affaires after the signing of the treaty and the reluctance with which they at last assented through the personal agency of lafayette would not indicate any desire to form ties of alliance with the united states—diplomatic correspondence vol x p  0 nor did the tedious manner in which the negotiation was carried on by mr gardoqui after he came to the united states and the claims made by him present the designs of the spanish cabinet under a

independence of the united states was recognized by spain see lespagne sous les rois de la maison de bourbon tom vi p    this work is a french translation of coxes memoirs of the kings of spain of the

stuarts letter—a spirit of jealousy which may become dangerous to the union towards the eastern states seems to be growing fast among us it is represented that the northern phalanx is so firmly united as to bear down all opposition while virginia is unsupported even by those whose interests are similar to hers it is the language of all i have seen on their return from new york colonel lee tells me that many who were warm supporters of the government are changing their sentiments from a conviction of the impracticability of union with states whose interests are so dissimilar to those of virginia i fear the colonel is one of the number the late applications to congress respecting the slaves will certainly tend to promote this spirit it gives particular umbrage that the quakers should be so busy in this business that they will raise up a storm against themselves appears to me very certain mr madisons sentiments are variously spoken of so much so that it is impossible to ascertain whether they are approved of by a majority or not the commercial and most noisy part is certainly against them it appears to me to be such a deviation from the plain and beaten track as must make every creditor of the public tremble his plan of discrimination is founded too much on principles of equity to please even those who have advocated always a discrimination if the public was to gain what the original holders lost in their sales i believe it would have pleased this description of citizens better—abingdon virginia march   th   at the annual meetings of the quakers held at philadelphia and new york in the year      they had sent memorials to congress praying that measures might be adopted for the abolition of the slavetrade these memorials were referred to a committee who brought in a report which was debated from time to time and after various amendments was reported by the committee of the whole house as follows that the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit cannot be prohibited by congress prior to the year   0  that congress have no authority to interfere in the emancipation of slaves or in the treatment of them within any of the states it remaining with the several states alone to provide any regulations therein which humanity and true policy may require that congress have authority to restrain the citizens of the united states from carrying on the african trade for the purpose of supplying foreigners with slaves and of providing by proper regulations for the humane treatment during their passage of slaves imported by the said citizens into the states admitting such importation such was considered by a majority of congress as a just interpretation of the constitution on this subject the first paragraph is a recital of the clause in the constitution which refers to the slavetrade as then existing by a prospective legislation congress prohibited the importation of slaves by an act which took effect in the year   0  by a subsequent act passed in the year    0 the slavetrade was declared to be piracy and punishable with death—storys commentaries vol iii p  0  for a condensed

justice to the very tender and respectful attachment which i have long entertained towards you and that you will be persuaded of the great pleasure with which i have learned the success that has followed the first movements of your administration after having given freedom to your country it was worthy of the virtues and great character of your excellency to establish its happiness on a solid and permanent basis which is assuredly the result of the new federal constitution in framing which you assisted by your counsel and which you now support as much by the splendor of your talents and patriotism as by the eminent situation confided to you by your fellowcitizens they possess the advantage of enjoying more particularly your beneficence and the honor of having you born among them but i dare assure you that the consideration which you enjoy throughout europe and particularly in my country yields not even to that which you have obtained in your native land and notwithstanding the prejudices of the people with whom i here live there is not one among them who does not pronounce your name with sentiments of respect and veneration all are acquainted with the services you have rendered to your country as their general in the course of the war and with those perhaps still greater which you now render as a statesman in peace the love of glory and of freedom which led the americans to surmount such great difficulties must still prevail to establish the principles of justice towards those of their fellowcitizens and strangers who assisted them in their distress and i have seen with great pleasure that from the first moment in which you have appeared at the head of the federal government the credit of the american nation has been established in every country of europe and that the confidence in her resources and means is infinitely better founded than in many of the older powers—   january    0   the ratification took place on the   th of may at newport   colonel robert h harrison   from dr stuarts letter i shall now endeavor to give you all the information i have been able to collect during my journey respecting the present temper of mind of the people of virginia so far as i can judge from those i mixed with and from what i could hear i could wish indeed to speak more favorably of it but it appears to me that the late transactions of congress have soured the public mind to a great degree which was just recovering from the fever which the slave business had occasioned when the late muchagitated question of the state debts came on with respect to the slave business i am informed by mr lomax whom i met on his return from pittsylvania that great advantages had been taken of it in that distant quarter by many who wished to purchase slaves circulating a report that congress were about to pass an act for their general emancipation this occasioned such an alarm that many were sold for the merest trifle the sellers were of course much enraged at congress for taking up a subject they were precluded by the constitution from meddling with for the present and thus furnishing the occasion for the alarm which induced them to sell as the people in that part of the country were before much opposed to the government it may naturally be supposed that this circumstance has embittered them much more against it as to the assumption of the state debts i scarce think it would be a measure generally acceptable on any principles on such as have been contended for i hardly think it would be acquiesced in by this state how far indeed a certain degree of shame or obstinacy natural to the human mind which acts as a constant check on every rising disposition to depart from a cause or side once resolutely espoused would continue to operate i know not but setting this aside i think i should not be far wrong in saying there would be as nearly a unanimity of opinion for an opposition as perhaps could ever be expected on any subject there is in general i think in consequence of these two instances a strong apprehension that the predictions relative to the grasping at power by unwarrantable constructions of the constitution will be verified on these two subjects at least it is observed by most for there are some who after a proper liquidation and allowance of credit to the states for what has been paid approve of the assumption that the constitution appeared so clear as to be incapable of misconstruction by those who wished to make it a rule and guide to their conduct at any rate on a subject of such importance which may be considered as doubtful in any shape under the constitution it would at least have been prudent in the members to consult the general sentiments entertained of it in their respective states but it really appears as if they were so charmed with the plenitude of their powers as to have considered this a degrading step a strong suspicion too is entertained from the number of speculators who have been traversing the state purchasing up state securities that there is a good deal of selfishness mixed with the plan and this perhaps causes it to be viewed with more particular dislike mr madisons conduct in this business has gained him great popularity even among those who are illiberal enough to pass severe censures on his motives respecting his discrimination plan as i passed through richmond the news of the rejection of the motion made by mr lee for opening the doors of the senate agreeably to his instructions from our legislature had just arrived it occasioned much disgust but the manner of the rejection seemed to be as offensive as the rejection itself it being said that after speaking two days ably on the subject without receiving an answer the question was called for and lost no one voting with him but his colleague and mr maclay it is supposed it will be productive of an application from our legislature to the other states calling on them to join them in similar instructions to their members it is a pity the public wish as i believe it to be in so trivial a matter cannot be gratified the slowness with which the business is carried on is another cause of complaint congress it is said sit only four hours a day and like schoolboys observe every saturday as a holiday if this be true it is certainly trifling with their constituents in the extreme who pay them liberally and have therefore a right to expect more diligence from them it is the more unfortunate as it is represented at the same time that they generally live for two dollars a day i have now gone through the catalogue of public discontents and it really pains me much and i believe every friend to the government to think that there should be so much cause for them and that a spirit so subversive of the true principles of the constitution productive of jealousies alone and fraught with such high ideas of their power should have manifested itself at so early a period of the government if mr henry has sufficient boldness to aim the blow at its existence which he has threatened i think he can never meet with a more favorable opportunity if the assumption should take place on the principles on which it has been contended for and i understand that though lost at present it is to be again brought on but i doubt much whether he possesses so adventurous a spirit it will be the fault of those who are the promoters of such disgustful measures if he ever does or indeed any one else i believe it has ever been considered as a maxim in governments recently established and which depend on the affections of the people that what is rigidly right ought not to be the only standard of conduct with those who govern their inclinations and passions too must be consulted more or less in order to effect ultimately what is right how much more ought this to be done when it rests solely on a construction of their powers whether a measure in contemplation ought to be carried into execution or not a member of the council who wrote privately to mr henry to know if he would accept of the office of senator in congress if appointed showed me his answer in which he declines it and says he is too old to fall into those awkward imitations which are now become fashionable from this expression i suspect the old patriot has heard some extraordinary representations of the etiquette established at your levees those of his party no doubt think they promote themselves in his good opinion by such high coloring it may not be amiss therefore to inform you that bland is among the dissatisfied on this score i am informed by good authority that he represented that there was more pomp used there than at st jamess where he had been and that your bows were more distant and stiff this happened at the governors table in richmond by such accounts i have no doubt the party think to keep alive the opposition and aversion to the government and probably too to make proselytes to their opinions—abingdon june  d   in his report on public credit  th january    0 hamilton gave it as his full conviction that an assumption of the debts of the particular states by the union and a like provision for them as for those of the union will be a measure of sound policy and substantial justice he distinctly recognized that the principles of equitable settlement between the states and the united states would require all the moderation and wisdom of the government and suggested that the balance in favor of each state be first determined and then to equalize the contributions of the states let each be charged with its proportion of the aggregate of those balances according to some equitable ratio to be devised for that purpose on this point were made the heaviest attacks for it was claimed virginia would suffer peculiarly while massachusetts and south carolina would benefit as greatly on these divisions the various states ranged themselves according to their interest and early in april the opposition obtained a rejection of the scheme in the house but its advocates still held to the measure this was the situation when washington wrote jefferson hinted that the scruples of those who in favoring the constitution had argued the improbability of congress laying taxes where the states could do it separately stood in the way of the assumption scheme the blocking of the bill for a permanent residence of congress afforded an opportunity to play the one measure against the other and a bargain was made that passed the assumption and removed the seat of government to the potomac the president did not escape some abuse on the result and jefferson through whom the bargain was effected regarded himself as duped by hamilton   to be instrumental in any degree to the accomplishment of the object which is mentioned in your letter would i do assure you give me pleasure but with truth i can add that i know no person who has either money to lend or who seems willing to part with it the most conclusive proof of which i shall give you i was much in want of a sum to answer some call upon me which i did not care to have unsatisfied when i set out for new york the spring before last but was unable to obtain more than half of it though it was not much i required and this at an advanced interest with other rigid conditions after this i took an occasion to sound mr carroll of carrollton as the most likely being the most monied man i was acquainted with—but without success—he assured me that he could not collect the interest of the money that had been loaned by his father and himself and his other resources were not more than adequate to his own occasions—thenceforward i made no further attempts not knowing indeed where to apply—washington to charles carter    september    0   key of the bastile sent through thomas paine at this time an ardent believer in the revolution   give me leave my dear general to present you

looted a british vessel at nootka sound on the ground of trespassing on spanish territory and were unwilling to make reparation as spain would be anxious to secure the aid or at least the neutrality of the united states in the event of war for the protection of her american possessions washington thought this a fitting opportunity to open negotiations at madrid for the opening of the mississippi humphreys was sent to cooperate with carmichael in this negotiation and the influence of france was to be invoked but before the envoy reached madrid an agreement had been arrived at between the two powers and the fears or interest of spain could no longer be worked upon to secure the coveted privilege when the first indications of the difference between spain and great britain appeared major george beckwith sounded the american executive on the attitude that the united states would assume and learned that there was no alliance that would lead them to favor spain washington thought that in the prospective war great britain would attack the spanish colonies in america from canada and interpreted the mission of beckwith as follows we great britain did not incline to give any satisfactory answer to mr morris who was officially commissioned to ascertain our intentions with respect to the evacuation of the western posts within the territory of the united states and other matters into which he was empowered to enquire till by this unauthenticated mode we can discover whether you will enter into an alliance with us and make common cause against spain in that case we will enter into

to the several members of the cabinet and to the vicepresident and chief justice provided the dispute between great britain and spain should come to the decision of arms from a variety of circumstances individually unimportant and inconclusive but very much the reverse when compared and combined there is no doubt in my mind that new orleans and the spanish posts above it on the mississippi will be among the first attempts of the former and that the reduction of them will be undertaken by a combined operation from detroit the consequences of having so formidable and enterprising a people as the british on both our flanks and rear with their navy in front as they respect our western settlements which may be reduced thereby and as they regard the security of the union and its commerce with the west indies are too obvious to need enumeration what then should be the answers of the executive of the united states to lord dorchester in case he should apply for permission to march troops through the territory of the said states from detroit to the mississippi what notice ought to be taken of the measure if it should be undertaken without leave which is the most probable proceeding of the two a difference of opinion prevailed in the cabinet on one side it was advised that permission to march troops through the territory should be pointedly refused and if persisted in afterwards that a remonstrance should be made to the court of great britain on the other side it was recommended to grant the request but if the march should be attempted without leave and after prohibition that it should be opposed and prevented at every risk and hazard the principles of national law and the practice of nations were discussed and brought to bear on the point the general result as recorded by washington was to treat the communications of major beckwith very civilly to intimate delicately that they carried no marks official or authentic nor in speaking of alliance did they convey any definite meaning by which the precise object of the british cabinet could be discovered in a word that the secretary of the treasury was to extract as much as he could from major beckwith and to report to me without committing by any assurances whatever the government of the united states leaving it entirely free to pursue unreproached such a line of conduct in the dispute as her interest and honor shall dictate the full history of this incident is related in the editors the united states and spain in    0   congress adjourned on the   th of august and washington took the opportunity to visit rhode island where he did not touch on his eastern tour because that state had not then acceded to the union a short sketch of this visit was made by william smith a member of congress from south carolina who accompanied the presidents party for a part of the journey and as this record is but little known i give the main points the party set off on the   th on board a rhode island packet and reached newport on tuesday morning   th as we entered the harbor a salute was fired from the fort and some pieces on the wharves at our landing we were received by the principal inhabitants of the town and the clergy who forming a procession escorted us through a considerable concourse of citizens to the lodgings which had been prepared for us the most respectable inhabitants were there severally presented to the president by mr marchant judge of the district court the president then took a walk around the town and the heights above it accompanied by the gentlemen of the party and a large number of gentlemen of newport we returned to our lodgings and at four oclock the gentlemen waited again on the president and we all marched in procession to the town hall or state house where while dinner was serving up a number of gentlemen were presented the dinner was well dished and conducted with regularity and decency the company consisted of about eighty persons after dinner some good toasts were drank among others following may the last be first in allusion to rhode island being the last state which ratified the constitution the president gave the town of newport and as soon as he withdrew judge marchant gave the man we love which the company drank standing the company then followed the president in another walk which he took around the town he passed by judge marchants and drank a glass of wine and then went to his lodgings which closed the business of the day i slept in the room with governor clinton wednesday   th immediately after breakfast addresses were presented by the clergy and the town of newport that of the latter by a committee the chairman of which judge marchant began to read the address but before he had proceeded far he was so agitated he had to resign it to col sherbet who read it very composedly we then formed another long procession down to the wharf and embarked for providence    we had a tedious passage to providence being seven hours in performing it the same salute took place as at newport but the procession up to the tavern was more solemn and conducted with a much greater formality having troops and music the governor of the state was so zealous in his respects that he jumped aboard the packet as soon as she got to the wharf to welcome the president to providence the president with the governor of the state on his right hand and mr forster a senator in congress from rhode island on his left moved in the front ranks then followed governor clinton mr jefferson the secretary of state for the united states mr blair a judge of the supreme federal court myself and the three gentlemen of the presidents family viz col humphreys maj jackson and mr nelson—who formed the party—afterward followed the principal inhabitants of providence and some from newport and other citizens making a long file preceded by some troops and music the doors and windows for the length of a mile were all crowded with ladies and spectators when we arrived at the tavern daggets the president stood at the door and the troops and procession passed and saluted in the procession were three negro scrapers making a horrible noise we then sat down to a family dinner after tea just as the president was taking leave to go to bed he was informed by col peck marshal of the district who had sailed with us from new york that the students of the college had illuminated it and would be highly flattered at the presidents going to see it which he politely agreed to do though he never goes out at night and it then rained a little and was a disagreeable night we now made a nocturnal procession to the college which indeed was worth seeing being very splendidly illuminated    thursday morning began with a heavy rain and cold easterly wind it cleared at nine oclock and then the president accompanied as before began a walk which continued until one oclock and which completely fatigued the company which formed his escort we walked all around the town visited all the apartments of the college went on the roof to view the beautiful and extensive prospect walked to a place where a large indiaman of  00 tons was on the stocks went on board her returned to town stopped and drank wine and punch at mr clarkes mr browns gov turners and gov bowens and then returned home as soon as the president was rested he received the addresses of the cincinnati the rhode island colleges and the town of providence and then went immediately to dinner to the town hall the dinner was attended by  00 persons and an immense crowd surrounded the hall after dinner several toasts were drank the second was the president of the united states at which the whole company within and without gave three huzzas and a long clapping of hands the president then rose and drank the health of all the company he afterward gave the town of providence    at the conclusion of the toasts the president rose and the whole company with a considerable crowd of citizens walked down to the wharf where he and his suite embarked for new york on monday august  0th the president and suite set out from new york for the south   acting upon a suggestion from the english cabinet lord dorchester sent major george beckwith to philadelphia to sound the executive upon the attitude of the united states in the event of a war between great britain and spain the results of this informal mission were communicated to dorchester and beckwith was retained at philadelphia as the unrecognized diplomatic agent of the british government a convenience while no regular minister had been appointed in this capacity he had approached hamilton with hints that gouverneur morris in his informal mission was not so discreet as he might be as he was in too close intimacy with the french minister in london luzerne and had given offence to the court by consorting with the opposition party of which fox was the leader—hamiltons works lodge iv    diary and letters of gouverneur morris i   0 et seq in reply mr hamilton said it is certainly very possible that motives different from the one avowed may have produced a certain communication and in matters of such a nature it is not only allowable but the dictate of prudence to receive suggestions with peculiar caution—october   th   from mr hamiltons reply the subject suggested in your letter as preparatory to the meeting of the legislature shall engage my particular attention the papers of the departments of state and the treasury and of the commissioners for settling accounts are on their way to philadelphia on the  0th i propose with my family to set out for the same place   relating to a house in philadelphia belonging to mr morris which was fitting up for the residence of the president when congress should remove to that place mr lear was in philadelphia making preparation for the presidents arrival and accommodation   in transcribing some words or lines appear to have been omitted the letter is printed as transcribed by william jackson one of washingtons secretaries   your favor of the   th ultimo came to my hands last night if the information of captain brant be true the issue of the expedition against the indians will indeed prove unfortunate and disgraceful to the troops who suffered themselves to be ambuscaded the relation of this event carries with it i must confess the complexion of truth yet i will suspend my opinion until i hear something more of the matter the force which was employed against these hostile indians or the drawing out of which was authorized ought not to have regarded a thousand of them because it was calculated for and undertaken under the expectation of meeting a larger number if blows were to terminate the dispute it gives me pleasure to learn from you the friendly sentiments of captain brant and with you i think they merit cultivation but he has not been candid in his account of the conduct of general st clair nor done justice in his representation of matters at muskingham it is notorious that he used all the art and influence of which he was possessed to prevent any treaty being held and that except in a small degree general st clair aimed at no more land by the treaty of muskingham than had been ceded by the preceding treaties—washington to governor clinton   december    0 on the outbreaks by the indians on the frontiers st clair collected a motley force of about fourteen hundred men badly armed and poorly disciplined and divided by the jealousies of the officers one division under john hardin was surprised and defeated a subsequent advantage did much to retrieve his reputation but this advantage was not followed up and the destruction of some indian villages was the chief result of the expedition the indians become bolder and more serious operations were planned by the general government i am apprehensive that governor st clairs communication of the object of the expedition to the officer commanding at detroit has been unseasonable and may have unfavorable consequences it was certainly premature to announce the operation intended until the troops were ready to move since the indians through that channel might receive such information as would frustrate the expedition—washington to knox   november    0   philadelphia was now the seat of government
