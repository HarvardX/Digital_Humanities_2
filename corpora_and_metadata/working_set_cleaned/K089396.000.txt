vaughan of molinger in the kingdom of ireland etc my lord your lordships great genius to a contemplative life which raises humane nature to an excellency above it self and highly influences the economy of this world has naturally induced me to make an humble dedication to you of this book the subject is abstruse and treated of by few and that sparingly if i have more enlarged my self upon it it is that some extraordinary visitations having happened to me in which i have had a converse with those genii i treat of have made so strong an impression on my mind that i could not well withold my self from perusing the best authors i could meet with relating to it in order to draw an abstract of what i found most material in them and to publish it together with my own experience and thoughts in that kind as i have here done i treat of this subject historically physiologically and theologically though not in distinct books but promiscuously as i found occasion presented it self as for my performance herein i could heartily wish it might prove to your lordships good liking and humbly submit it to your lordships great judgment and censure being  my lord your lordships most humble and most obedient servant john beaumont  to the reader having long promised the world this book perhaps the jocose part of mankind may now be apt to say quid ferat hic tanto dignum promissor hiatu parturiunt montes etc be it as it may i have here made good my promise and though i may not persuade my self that all men will acquiesce in what i here deliver i not pretending in this subject to mathematical demonstration yet i shall be free to say that i fear no man who shall pretend to bring more reason for an opinion contrary to that i assert and i believe whoever shall peruse this book will find that i am not ignorant of what opposers of all kinds may take upon them to offer against it indeed while we rely merely on reason in subjects of this nature i doubt we may have all too much cause to lament our selves with the ingenious fracastorius in ep ad flaminium  quid dicam miserum me agere and quamducere vitam irrequietam animi and quaerentem indagine vana naturam semper fugientem quae se ubi paulum ostendit mihi mox facies in milla repent ceu proteus conversa sequentem eludit and angit maerenten seniique horas cassumque laborem unhappy man what can i say i do how lead my life thus restless to pursue still flying nature which although by chance may now and then present m a little glance strait proteus like in thousand shapes she is rest so mocks my toil and frets my pensive breast we read of pentheus that upon his getting upon a tree and making himself a spectator of the hidden sacrifices of bacchus he was struck with such a kind of fury that all things seemed double to him two suns and two thebes presented themselves to his sight so that when he was hasting to thebes presently seeing another thebes he was drawn back and thus he was continually carried to and fro in a restless condition  eumenidum veluti demens videt agmina pentheus et solemn geminum and duplices se ostendere thebas as pentheus mazed whole troops of furies spies two suns two thebes presented to his eyes now this fable as the lord bacon tells us relates to divine secrets for those who forgetting frail mortality rashly aspire to divine mysteries by high flights in the study of nature and philosophy as though they were mounted on a tree have this for their punishment that they are perplexed with a perpetual inconstancy and wavering in judgment for the light of nature being one thing and the divine light another it happens with them as though they saw two suns and since the actions of life and the decrees of the will depend of the understanding it follows that they hesitate no less in their wills than in opinion and are altogether at variance with themselves and therefore they likewise see two thebes for by thebes which was the habitation and retiring place of pentheus the ends of our actions are represented hence it happens that they know not which way to turn themselves but being uncertain and wavering as to the main of things they are whirled about by sudden impulses of mind in every particular matter and i believe that those that will not acquiesce in what we have delivered us in the scriptures and by christian tradition concerning spirits but will be meddling in setting up other hypotheses by their frail reason for solving facts commonly ascribed to spirits will find their judgment so perplexed and brought into such a labyrinth upon perusing what is here written and that even setting by what i affirm from my own experience as to an existence of spirits and their operations which i least rely on or urge as argumentative that they will never be able to extricate themselves and upon this issue i leave it only adding this saying of the learned monsieur le clerc in pref in philos acerbos homines non moror indignos quippe qui haec studia tractent aut

the genii that are said to attend men to be as to their nature and offices having undertaken to write a tract concerning the genii that are said to attend men during this life i think it proper for me in the first place to set forth what according to the ancients those genii were understood to be as to their nature and offices  l de dies not c   censorinus tells us that genius is a god under whose tuition each man is born and lives and whether it be that he takes care of our generation or is engendered with us or takes upon him our guardianship after we are begotten he says he is called genius from geno an ancient latin word signifying to beget in lieu of which the word gigno is now used genius is said to be son of jupiter and the earth as being held to be of a middle nature betwixt gods and men or for that he somewhat partakes of body some have thought our genius to be the symmetry of the elements which preserves humane bodies and all living creatures others the secret power of the celestial bodies by which we are impelled to do all things and these were called geruli from gero or ingero that is from supporting us or suggesting good or bad thoughts into our minds  what the latins called genius the greeks called demon which word to pass by other significations according to its etymology signifies prudent knowing skilful in affairs and foreseeing things they giving answers to those that consulted them in which sense socrates thought famous men after death for a reward of their virtue were made demons of a middle nature mediating betwixt gods and men  ludovicus vives says it is a wonder to see how differing the opinions of the gentiles were in aug de civ dei l   c   concerning the gods and demons so that apuleius thinks otherwise than plato plotinus than apuleius porphyrius differs from them both nor does proclus agree in all things with jamblicus or any other as for the genii some think them to be our own souls some our inclinations some a certain light attending us some the intellectus agens etc concerning which i shall set down what i find in several authors  apuleius writes thus l de deo socr in a certain sense the mind of man even while it is in the body is called a demon dii ne hunc ardorem mentibus addunt eurile an sua cuique deus sit dira cupido and therefore a good desire of mind is a good god whence some think those are called blessed eudaemons whose demon is good that is whose mind is perfect with virtue which i think you may properly call a genius because that god which is each mans mind though it be immortal yet in some sort is engendered within us and there are some who as it seems to me would have the mind of man freed from the body to be a second sort of demons this i find in the ancient latin tongue to be called lemur and he of these lemures who taking care of his posterity keeps the house as a calm and quiet deity is called a family lar but he that by reason of demerits in life is punished by a wandering in the world having no quiet seat and becomes a vain terror to good men and offensive to evil is commonly called larva but when it is uncertain what lot has happened to a man whether he be a lar or larva he is called the god manes the word god being added for honors sake they calling those gods who among them having justly and prudently governd the course of their lives are afterward deifyd by men and admitted to temples and sacred rites as in boeotia amphiaraus in africa mopsus in egypt osiris others elsewhere aesculapius every where and so far concerning those demons that have had bodies but there is another kind of more august demons which being always free from the fetters and ties of bodies are drawn to us by certain prayers from this sort of sublime demons plato thinks each man has one given him as a witness and guard in passing this life which though seen by no man are always present as witnesses not only of our actions but even of our thoughts and that upon our return at the end of our lives the said genii presently carry us as their charge to judgment and there stand as witnesses at our trial where if we falsify in any thing they reprove us if we speak truth they vouch it and sentence is past according to their testimony so far apuleius  porphyrius l de abstinentia says that as evil demons hurt mankind so good demons never intermit their offices but foreshew us dangers as far as they may hanging over our heads from the evil demons while they make us signs both by dreams and by the soul divinely inspired and many other things and that if any man could distinguish these things which are signified he would know and precaution himself against all frauds for they signify to all men but all persons do not perceive the things that are signified  occult phil l   c    agrippa says that each man has a threefold genius to guard him one sacred another of the geniture the third of the profession a man follows the first is not derived from the stars or planets but given by god it being universal and above nature this directs the soul still suggesting good thoughts and enlightens us though it be not always observed but when we are purified and live in a calm then it is perceived by us then it speaks as it were with us and communicates its voice being present before in silence and labors continually to bring us to sacred perfection by the assistance of this genius we may shun the malignity of fate whom if we religiously observe by an uprightness and holiness of life as we know socrates did the platonicks think we are wonderfully aided by him both by dreams and signs for putting by evils and securing good to us the genius or demon of the geniture descends to us from the disposition of the world and the circuits of the stars that are concerned in our generation this is the sustainer and guardian of life it procures it to the body and takes care of it afterward and aids the person for performing that office for which the heavens deputed him at his birth those therefore who have received a fortunate genius are rendered strong powerful efficacious and prosperous in their works wherefore by philosophers they are called been fortunati and been nati the demon of the profession is given from the stars to which such a profession or sect as a man professes is subjected and which the soul when it begins to use election in this body and takes upon it manners secretly wishes which demon is changed for a more worthy or less upon the change of the profession when therefore the profession agrees with our nature we get a demon like us and agreeing with our genius and our life is made more calm happy and prosperous but when we take on us a profession unlike or contrary to our genius our life is rendered more laborious and troublesome by discording patrons whence it happens that a man makes proficiency in a little time and with a little labor in one science art or ministry who in others toils with much sweat and labor to no purpose and though no science art or virtue is to be despised yet that you may live prosperously and act fortunately know first of all your good genius and your nature and what good the disposition of the heavens and god the disposer of all these promises you who distributes to each man as he pleases follow these beginnings profess these apply your self to that virtue to which the prime distributer raises and conducts you and in what virtue you find your self to profit most easily endeavor to rise to the height of it that you may excel in one which you cannot do in all however do not slight any perfection as far as you are able to proceed in it and if you have guardians according to your nature and profession you will find a double proficiency of your nature and profession but if they are unlike follow the best for sometimes you will find the aid of an egregious profession better than that of your nativity ib c  0 the same author writes thus as to each man is given a good spirit so there is an evil one both which seek an union with our spirit and endeavor to draw it to them and so mix themselves with it the good by good works conformable to him changes us into angels by union as he that adheres to god is made one spirit with him the evil demon by bad works endeavors to make us conformable and united to him and this is what hermes says when a demon flows into an humane soul he sprinkles in it seeds of his own notions whence such a soul sprinkled with seeds raised in a fury brings forth wonderful things and such as are the performances of demons for a good demon when he passes into an holy soul he raises it to the light of wisdom but an evil demon transfused into a wicked soul incites it to thefts murders and lusts and whatsoever are the performances of evil demons good demons as jamblicus says most perfectly purge souls and others give us other things being present they give health to the body virtue to the spirit security to the mind destroy what brings death in us foment the heat and render it more efficacious for life and by an intelligible harmony always infuse light into the mind i am of the opinion of those that think all men are governed by the ministry of many spirits and are led to all degrees of virtues merits and dignity if they render themselves worthy of them but those that render themselves unworthy are cast down and detruded by the evil demons as well as by the good spirits to the lowest degree of misery as their demerits require but those who are committed to the more sublime angels are preferred before other men for the angels that have care of them raise them and by a certain secret power subject others to them which though neither perceive yet he that is subjected finds a certain weight of presidency from which he cannot easily disingage himself nay he fears and reverences that force which the superior angels influence the inferiors with and bring the inferiors by a certain terror into the fear of presidency so we read that mark antony formerly being joined in a singular friendship with octavian augustus they were wont often to play together but augustus being always conqueror a certain magician thus admonished mark antony what do you do antony with that young man fly and shun him for though you are elder and more experienced in affairs of a more illustrious family and have been a great commander in wars yet your genius much dreads the genius of this youth and your fortune flatters his and unless you fly far from him it will wholly turn to him occult phil lib   c   again agrippa tells us the ancient sages teach us to know the nature of each mans genius from the stars and their influences and aspects at each mans birth but by so differing and disagreeing rules that it is very hard to get these mysteries out of their hands for porphyrius seeks the genius from the star that is lady of the geniture maternus either thence or from the planets that have been most dignified there or from that whose house the moon is to enter after that it holds at the time of the persons nativity but the chaldeans seek the genius only from the sun or moon others again and many of the hebrews from some cardinal point of the heavens or from all of them others seek for the good genius from the eleventh house which therefore they call the good demon and the evil genius from the sixth which they call the evil demon since therefore the search of these is laborious and very abstruse we may much more easily seek the nature of our genius from our selves attending to those things which our mind suggests to us the instinct of nature dictates and heaven inclines us to from our first untainted innocence or when our mind is purged of vain cares and sinister effects and impediments are removed from it these doubtless are the kindly suggestions of the genius that is given to each man at his birth leading and persuading us to that which our constellation inclines so far agrippa he that would see more concerning the search after each mans peculiar demon may read a little tract on that subject printed at the end of a book entitled trinum magicum set forth by longinus  natalis comes says myth l   c   the genii or demons present us with the species or images of those things they would persuade us to as in a glass on which images when our soul privately looks those things come into our mind which if considered with reason give us a right determination of mind but if a man setting reason aside be carried away with the guidance of evil species or images he will of necessity incur many errors especially if the images are presented us by evil demons whence many become wholly given over to lusts cruelty covetousness etc all which are imputed to the genius  dissert    maraviglia in his pseudomantia writes thus though many have thought the genii to be nothing but a certain light placed by god in our minds at our birth whereby we understand all things and being understood if they are good we love and pursue them if bad we decline and avoid them yet the more common opinion was that the genii were not only a light discovering and foreshewing future things to us but certain pure spirits standing by us always to guard and admonish us though it be far more credible that those genii in all ages were the very wills of men naturally predisposed with a desire and love or an aversion and abhorrence of things good or evil discusd and proposed to them by the understanding the same author tells us animadv  0 that pythagoras thought the genii were certain lights naturally implanted in our minds apuleius thought they were the minds themselves and disposition of each man the ancient pagans that they were good and evil demons appointed to each man from the beginning for his governance again dissert   he writes as follows the prophesying spirits called in the scriptures angels are called by the ancient pagans genii fatidici as though generated from god and sent from heaven to us to foretell future things for they thought these fatidical spirits whom they variously worshipped knew all things that were to come in the world and could foretell them because themselves were a part or a certain particle of the soul of the world which is every where for they were of opinion that this soul was diffused through the whole world but chiefly seated in the aetherial region and consequently in the stars themselves and more especially in the sun from which all inferior things are fomented as it were by rays of a vivifying soul transmitted to them whence also they thought these kinds of substances composed of a subtle body such as an aerial body is and that angels demons and souls were from a particle of the mundane soul which substances apuleius says are placed in the aerial region of the world that they might procure a more easy commerse betwixt gods and men and more readily unfold the secrets of the gods etc  ludovicus vives writes thus in aug de civ dei l   c   plato in his timaeus and cratylus calls the best part of our mind a demon his words are these you know what they are whom hesiod calls demons viz that golden race of men of whom he says thus but after fate this race has took away they are pure terrestrial demons called and they are mens blessed guard all evils keep away tho i think that race was called golden not that it consisted of gold but that it was good and excellent and i conceive we are called an ironage in comparison of that but if any one now living be good hesiod numbered him among his golden men and what are the good but the prudent and i conceive he called them demons from their prudence and skill in affairs the name it self in our ancient tongue showing it therefore it is well said of him and most of the rest of the poets that when a good man departs this life he is placed in some excellent post of honor and made a demon for his wisdom after this manner therefore i affirm that a wise man so he be good both living and dead is a demon and justly so called this we find in plato  whence doubtless origin drew his error where he writes that human souls are changed into demons and these again into those porphyrius also says that each mans peculiar demon is a certain part of the soul viz the mind and he is an happy man and one eudaemon that has got a wise mind and unhappy on the contrary and that souls infested with vices pass into the nature of evil demons and are rendered like them in lies and impostures proclus explains all these things laying down a threefold nature of a demon he writes thus plato in his timaeus says our animal nature is a demon but this must be admitted but comparitively for there is a demon by essence another by comparison another by reference or respect for every where that which next presides being a certain order of demon in respect of the inferior is usually called a demon in which sense jupiter in orpheus calls his father saturn a demon and plato in his timaeus called those gods demons that immediately order generation indeed by comparison such an one is a demon which next provides for every one whether it be god or inferior to god and in some respect that mind is said a demon which performs wonderful actions more like to those of a demon than of a man and has his whole life suspended from a demon after this way i think socrates called those minds demons in a republic which had passed their lives well and were translated into a better state finally a demon by essence is called a demon not by respect to sequents nor by reason of some similitude to another thing but has got his property of himself and has a certain distinct existence and his proper powers and his different ways of acting indeed the rational soul in timaeus is always called an animal demon but he does not mean it a demon simply for when we say a demon simply its a certain middle nature betwixt gods and men by plotinus and others its quaeried whether our minds are moved of themselves to desires and determinations or by the impulse of some deity and first they said humane minds were spontaneously moved but they found upon search that we were impelled to all honest actions by a certain familiar genius or numen given us at our birth and that we desire or covet evil things by our mind for it cannot be that we covet evil things by the will of a deity whom its manifest no evil can please though doubtless by many of the platonicks the affections also with which we are carried away are called demons  ammianus marcellinus writes thus hist l    divines tell us that as all men are born saving the stedfastness of fate certain divine powers are associated to them to be a sort of governors of their actions though they are seen by few whom manifold virtues have dignified and this oracles and famous authors have taught among whom menander unicuique homini statim nascenti adest demon vitae mystagogus and so we are given to understand from homers immortal poems that the celestial gods have not spoke to valiant men nor have been present to them nor aided them in their fights but familiar genii attended them by whose aid pythagoras and socrates are said chiefly to have raised their fame numa pompilius also and the elder scipio and as some think marius and octavianus who had first the title of augustus given him and hermes trismegistus and apollonius tyanaeus and plotinus who has adventured at some reasonings about this mystical matter and profoundly to show from what beginnings these genii become connected to the minds of men which receiving as it were in their embraces they defend as far as they may and teach them great things if they find them pure and severed from the corruption of sinning by an immaculate society with the body  l de vit propr c    hieronymus cardanus says in general there were manifold differences of demons among the ancients forbidding as that of socrates admonishing as that of cicero at his death teaching things to come by dreams brutes casualties advising us to go to a place and deceiving us by one sense or more and by so much he is the nobler likewise by natural and also by nonnatural things and this we think the noblest also a good and a bad  in not in lucian de lucra gilbertus cognatus writes that some think by the word manes souls separated from the body are signified whence we see that ancient monuments of sepulchers are inscribed diis manibus and those that demolish sepulchers are thought to violate the god manes in the body they are called genii separated from the body lemures when they infest houses they are called larvae on the contrary if they are good familiar lares  that egregious philologer kircher vol   p     in his oedipus aegyptiacus gives the following account of the genii according to the doctrine of the egyptians the egyptians had always in great veneration certain statues which they called serapes the latins penates or lares some say the penates are naught but those genii or deasters by which we breathe we know we see we behold the sun viz jupiter juno minerva and vesta for they called the middle region of the air jupiter the lower juno the top part of the ether minerva who is the power of divine intelligence the earth vesta these they called and believed to be the gods of provinces and of our births and presidents over cities and guards of private houses and dionysius halicarnassaeus says the romans call these gods penates and some translating them into greek call them genethlios or genitales others call them domestic and familiar gods some the presidents of possessions others secret gods they are called genethlii because they are thought to be appointed to the guard of men presently upon their being born or because by their vigilance all things are generated whence the genii are also called the presidents of things that are to be generated they are called patrii because they were thought to preside only over those things which are common to some region or province in which with great diligence they ordered things not only belonging to every city but also to every house to all men plants and animals according to the care committed to them the serapes of the egyptians were naught but images without any eminency of their limbs rolled as it were in swadlingcloaths partly made of an appropriate stone partly of metal wood or shell some of these as tutelary gods were placed in public places for a guard of them others of them were appointed for a guard of persons and were standing tutelaries some others were portable which whither soever men went they carried with them some also they carried as amulets about their necks at their girdles and about their handwrists moreover their countenances were variously figured for some had a womanly countenance and their heads veiled some were in the form of boys with a vitta about their heads others were represented other ways they differed also in instruments some which they called averrunei or apotropaei were figured with various instruments as whips scourges nets hanging from their shoulders and these are the images which the hebrews call theraphim and which the scriptures tell us rachel stole from her father laban genesis    which were brought from egypt by the servants of abraham into palestina and propagated there they called them theraphim because as they could not pronounce s changing s into t according to the use of the chaldaeans and changing the last s into im they called those images theraphim which the egyptians called serapes now the penates of the egyptians were the same with osiris isis nephte horus harpocrates arveris apopis and innumerable deasters of this kind which though they were accounted the universal genii of all nature and the same as to substance only differing in effects yet as they were deputed to the guard of private things they had the name of tutelaries and were worshipped as private deities so far kircher  from these genii of the gentiles erasmus in his adages thinks christian divines have ascribed to each person two angels a good and a bad though i think he says it with little reason a communion with angels being so usual with the patriarchs from whom in all probability the gentiles took their doctrine of the genii the genii were drawn under several forms as of a serpent a boy a girl a youth or an old man as cebes in his table censorinus and many of the ancients tell us the lares and the genii were the same now the lares were represented in the form of young men clothed with dogskins and having a dog to attend them intimating that they were friendly and fawning to domestics and formidable to strangers as dogs are wont to be pierius tells us from chrysoppus erogl l   c  that the lares were clothed with dogsskins because they represent the genii who are appointed for our guard and as commissioners to inflict punishments on us for all our evil words and deeds and to avenge crimes and all impiety as often as humanity laid by we decline to a brutal life which the genii as sagacious dogs pursue and draw to condign punishments he adds and as the genii are given us for assiduous attendants never departing from us it is with justice he says that the dog as a tutelary animal was hieroglyphically dedicated to the lares being the same with the genii which we may more properly call angels and he says he cannot pass by what he has read among ancient writers viz that there was a temple of vulcan at mount aetna in sicily in whose grove there were dogs which fawned on those that came thither with purity and piety but miserably rent the impure and polluted as though divinely presaging the thing  i could write more concerning the genii of the ancients as of the sacrifices that were made to them and other particulars but it is beside my business here and i shall only note that beside the genii attending each person the ancients supposed others presiding over each country city etc those in the figure prefixed to this book being such as i took them from cartarius his images of the gods of the ancients the explanation of which figures is as follows  the figure on the left hand represents the evil genius that infested the inhabitants of the town temessa in italy the story is thus pausanias writing of euthymus in clia poster the champion tells us that ulysses in his wanderings coming to the town of temessa one of his associates for having ravished a virgin was stoned to death by the townsmen whereupon his ghost continually infested them so that they were upon quitting the town till they were told by apollos oracle that to appease him they must build him a temple and sacrifice to him yearly the most beautiful virgin they had among them which as they prepared to perform it chanced that one euthymus a champion came to the town and desired to be admit  the temple who seeing the virgin and falling in love with her undertook to fight with the genius and overcame him and forced him out of the country and married the virgin this genius was of a very black color and a formidable appearance having a wolfs skin fastened about him  as to the little figure in the middle the story is thus as pausanias relates it in the same book the eleans worship as their country god sosipolis which signifies the preserver of their city his sacrifices being wont to be yearly celebrated in the temple of lucina concerning this god what follows is recorded when the arcadians invaded the country of the eleans and the eleans presented an army against them a woman with a child sucking at her breast came to the chief commanders of the eleans and told them that when she brought forth that child she was admonished in a dream to place him with the eleans in the battle whereupon the chief commanders of the eleans having thought fit to credit the woman placed the child before their standard upon the arcadians onset the boy in their sight turned into a serpent by which prodigy being frighted they presently fled the eleans smartly pursuing them and upon getting this famous victory they gave him the name of sosipolis and at a place where the serpent was seen to go into a cavern a temple was built after the victory and honors were decreed to lucina because they thought the boy was brought into the world by her this god was drawn as a boy with a garment of various colors sprinkled with stars holding in his hand an horn of plenty for in this form he was seen by some person in a dream i may here note that the form of serpents under which the genii were worshipped denotes the wise and vigilant care they have over us  as for the figure on the right hand in some of adrians coin this inscription is found genesis p r where is seen the image of a military man compassed about with a garment which reaches to the middle of his legs having in the right hand a dish like a sacrificing vessel and in the left an horn of plenty this probably being the genius of the people of rome under whose guardianship their city was the horn and dish showing that the roman state as all others are supported by outward plenty and religious devotion toward god  in some of the ancient coins of trajan and adrian is seen a genius presenting with his right hand a dish on an altar adorned with garlands and holding in his left hand a whip or somewhat like it hanging down this by some is thought to denote rewards and punishments in the coin of marcus aurelius is a genius having such a dish in the right hand and an horn of plenty in the other with this inscription geniis exerci et genio augusti so in the coin of fl valerius constantinus genio populi romani p l c where he holds in the right hand a dish with a star in the left an horn of plenty again in that of maximinus sometimes with this inscription genio augusti sis sometimes genio populi romani t f sometimes genio imperatoris these and the like inscriptions are gathered together in a particular book by the learned physician adolphus occo in the antiquities also of appian such inscriptions of monuments are found in the city of tarraco in arragonia and so much for a general notion of the genii of the ancients  chap ii concerning the genii that are ascribed to socrates aristotle ptolinus porphyrius jamblicus chicus scaliger and cardan though the genii of these men are reducible to the chapters i shall go upon beneath where i shall examine what perception men have had of spirits or genii by their several senses yet in regard the learned naudaeus in his apology for all the great men that have been accused of magic part   c    has writ particularly concerning the genii of these men and exploded them and other authors have writ against the genius of socrates i shall here particularly consider what may be said concerning these genii  the most celebrated instance of a genius among the ancients is that of socrates testimonies for it are given by plato xenophon and antisthenes his contemporaries confirmed by laertius plutarch maximus tyrius dion chrysostomus cicero apuleius ficinus and others many of the moderns besides tertullian origin clemens alexandrinus austin and others socrates himself in platos theage says by some divine lot i have a certain demon which has followed me from my childhood as an oracle and this is a voice which when it happens always disswades the thing i am about to do but never prompts me to do any thing and if any of my friends communicate any thing with me and the voice is heard it disswades and is against the doing of it and presently after he relates how a person lost his life for having despised the command of his demon warning him not to depart from him again speaking to alcibiodes he says my tutor is better and wiser than you and speaking concerning the power of his demon even on other persons that used his company and conversation he says if it be grateful to my god you will profit much and in a little time if on the contrary not and again in his apology he says going out of doors this morning the sign of god did not oppose me  many have been of opinion that socrates had not only a perception of his genius by his sense of hearing but likewise by his sight and feeling so apuleius says he judged socrates perceived the sign of his demon not only by his ears lib de deo socr but by his eyes also because he affirmed that often not a voice but a divine sign was presented to him which he was the more induced to believe for that it was so common a thing with the pythagoreans to see demons that they wondered if any man said he had seen none which gift i impute to their great silence and their deep recess of mind for as paracelsus with others say silence is the joy of all spirits the author of the small tract entitled de proprii cujusque nati daemonis investigatione printed at the end of the trinum magicum before mentioned says the same viz that socrates both heard his demon and saw him and pictorius in his dialogue de materia daemonum says that socrates affirms his demon often to have spoke to him who he sometimes saw and touched so again l de daemo socret theocritus in plutarch will have it that a vision attended him from his childhood guiding him in all the actions of his life which vision going before him was a light in affairs where humane prudence could not reach and that the spirit often spoke to him divinely governing and inspiring his intentions  notwithstanding the opinion of these men and others that socrates had a perception of his genius by more senses than one i shall only here insist on the perception he had of him by his sense of hearing which in regard it is so well attested by plato and xenophon his disciples who were envious competitors for learning if it may be so said of philosophers so that they can no ways be suspected for having combined together to impose on the world i wholly give credit to though i well know there always have been and still are some men in the world who have caveled at what is said of socratess genius as a thing feigned whose reasons i shall now examine  the learned naudaeus in his laudable work abovementioned and the    th chapter of it treating concerning the genii ascribed to socrates and others as above writes thus according to the authority of all authors each of these persons may boast of having been led into the temple of glory and immortality by the assistance of some genius or familar demon which was to them  de deo socr as apuleius says a singular guide a domestic inspector an inseparable judge and witness a disapprover of evils and an approver of good but since we cannot maintain this opinion without abating much of these mens merit and the obligation we owe to their labors by the means of which and not of those demons and tutelary gods so many precious relics and monuments of their learning are come to our knowledge i think it very proper to preserve the praise due to them and to show by the true construction that ought to be given to this conversation how far those are out of the way in their imaginations who persuade themselves it was such as that of angels with holy persons or of demons with magicians for to come as near to the truth as we may we ought to observe that the platonicks according to the testimonies of jamblicus and fxius l de mist aeypt jacment in phaedon supposed four sorts of rational animals under that they called the first being or the first good who is the prime author and mover of all things viz the celestial gods or angels demons that were inferiors to them heroes and the souls of men in general and that the chief office and duty of demons being no other as proclus says but to concern themselves in the affairs and conduct of the last l de anim and daem and to serve them as guides and mediators toward the gods men have taken an occasion from the resemblance of these actions to those that souls exercise on their bodies to give these sometimes the name of demons and especially when they come so to free themselves from the slavery and tyranny of the matter where they are as it were interred that they make themselves absolute mistresses of all their faculties and no longer produce but miracles and actions altogether like those of demons which is the true sense according to which apuleius said that the mind of man l de deo socr even while in the body is called a demon and heraclitus that the spirit of man served him for a genius and the just desire and good operation of the soul may be likewise qualified with the name of god since even porphyrius said to this purpose after plato in his timaedus that god has given us the superior faculty of our spirit as a demon to guide us and that he may rightly be called an eudaemon that takes wisdom as a watch tower to guide him in all the actions of his life which might serve us for a general solution to answer all that is said of the familiarity and conversation of certain demons with socrates aristotle and others if it were not rather requisite to satisfy particular objections that may be made against each of them and to examine first what we ought to believe concerning the so famous and renowned demon of socrates no less celebrated by the authority of those that have given us the history of it than by the great diversities of judgments that have been made of him some saying that there may be some likelihood of truth for its being really so others that it was a mere fiction of this philosopher or of his two disciples xenophon and plato who as falsely published the report of this divine assistance as that of the oracles declaring him the wisest of men and here naudaeus lays before us all the dirt that envy or prejudice has thrown on socrates and then goes on thus but since i should but expose my self to the laughter of all men to follow the licentiousness of these dangerous spirits who so freely sham the authority of these two great philosophers as also that of apuleius maximus tyrius cicero plutarch and almost all the good authors to show themselves more subtle and clear sighted than others by crushing to pieces this old image i rather choose to range my self of their side that respect it since i cannot persuade my self that so great a number of writers would have loaded socrates with so many praises or called him as martial did the great old man l   epigr    sat   l de deo socra persius the reverend master valerius maximus the mind vested with virile strength or finally as apuleius the old man of divine wisdom if he had not signalized himself by his wisdom so that we ought rather to excuse than reprehend those who do not judge without reason that he had acquired it through the favor and assistance of some demon though nevertheless there be no less uncertainty concerning the explication of his nature than of malice and calumny in the precedent opinion for apuleius would have it to be a god lactantius and tertullian a devil plato thought he was invisible apuleius that he might also be visible plutarch that it was a sneezing on the right or left side according to which socrates foretold a good or evil event of the thing undertaken maximus tyrius that it was a remorse of conscience against the promptness and violence of his natural temper which was neither heard nor seen by which socrates was withheld and hindered from doing some evil thing pomponatius that it was the stars that ruled at his nativity and finally montaigne was of opinion it was a certain impulse of his will that presented it self to him without council of his discourse as for my self i believe it may be said conformably enough to truth that this familiar demon of socrates which was to him a foreseer in uncertain things a preadmonisher in doubtful a guide in dangerous was naught but the good rule of his life the wise conduct of his actions and the result of all his virtues that formed in him this prudence which may with justice be called the luster and seasoning of all his actions the eye that sees all guides and orders all and in a word the art of life as physic is the art of health so that there is much more seeming ground to believe that the soul of this philosopher purifyed from its violent passions and enriched with all kinds of virtues was the true demon of his conduct than to imagine that he entangled himself with illusions and phantomes gave credit to them or followed their counsels being a thing wholly absurd which plutarch seems to have a mind to root out of our fancies when he says in the book he has composed concerning this demon that socrates did not despise celestial things as the athenians would persuade him at his condemnation though it be very true that many apparitions fables and superstitious things being crept into the philosophy of pythagoras and his disciples which rendered it wholly ridiculous and contemptible he did what he could to manage it with prudence and to clear it of all these tales and to believe of it but what he judged reasonable and beneath having solved some difficulties to be met with concerning the demon of socratus he adds but beside that this would be a too manifest interfering with the precept of horace de art poet nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus inciderit  to refer the predictions of socrates and the counsel he gave his friends to some divinity we may more reasonably say that as he was wholly carried to moral actions so he had particularly considered all the accidents that happened to men and that the least thing made him foresee and judge of the future this is what naudaeus has writ concerning the demon of socrates  pseudom vet disser    maraviglia writes that socrates being wholly taken up in giving moral precepts ascribed all to a genius thinking thereby to give weight to his profitable arguments which he every where used for instruction well knowing what authority a man carries who is believed to give his instructions by the direction of a divine afflatus hence though plutarch and apuleius believed socratess genius was a true demon which by reason of his most pure and calm mind conversed with him from his infancy yet nothing evinces it to be ought but the natural subtilty sagacity reason and prudence of his mind cultivated by meditation and practice which as a right dictamen admonisht and proposed to him things to be rightly done and judged well of futurities for its reason which continually whispers unto us what is to be hoped for or feared and that is wont to be called our genius and inward voice always speaking to us without having need of a separate genius and timarcus in plutacch who went into trophoniuss cave to enquire after the truth of socratess genius could receive nothing more probable but those genii were portions of the mind seated about the head of man as being naturally endowed with a greater wisdom  the learned anton van dale dissert   c   m d in his last edition of his book of oracles rejects the demon of socrates thus what have not the ancient pagans said concerning the demon of socrates what not even the christians but from what men of authority does it appear that socrates ever had such a familiar demon since all of them ought to have had it from the mouth of socrates or of the socraticks cherephon and others to whom socrates had told it and after having exploded what the oracle is said to have delivered of socrates viz that he was the wisest of men he concludes the chapter thus but truly those things which were so rashly believed and delivered by so many both christians and pagans concerning his demon which is testified only by himself for so he boasts of himself in platos dialogue entitled theage and others of his disciples forsooth carry the same or rather the like show of truth for who may not as well believe pythagoras who as laertius testifies from others said he was first aethalides then euphorbus then hermotimus then pyrrhus a fisherman of delos before he was in the last place pythagoras for the reasons and arguments of socrates concerning his demon in plato carry the same weight  hist des specter l   c    monsieur le loyer delivers himself in a different way concerning the demon of socrates writing thus do we not find that the idolatrous egyptians believed there were genii who admonished men committed to their care and government by a well formed and articulate voice and from whom had they this but from the hebrews those that examine the doctrine of the egyptians and their priests know that they are but the hebrews apes though concealing as much as possible their authors and those whose doctrine they follow which they do with such an affected dissimulation that he that does not look near to them shall never be able to discover the traces and footsteps of these thieves they had learnt that the hebrews by a secret tradition held their patriarchs had angels which guarded them and that the patriarch jacob had not concealed his having an angel which had preserved him in all places where he had been they held also that these angels invisibly admonisht the said patriarchs and that their voice was heard  from this hebrew tradition and doctrine the egyptians forged their genii confounding them with the angels though the genii are but demons and gave them a voice by which they advertized men and i certainly believe that from the egyptians plato drew and took the genius or demon of sacrates which he makes invisible and to be heard speaking and forming some voice and tho plato imitating in this the egyptians seems to say that the genius which governed and guided socrates was a good demon and genius yet i take him but for a devil which led socrates to an unhappy death the same le loyer in his said book cap    says he concludes with several doctors of the church that socrates was a magician because he used divination  now to consider what these authors have said concerning the genius of socrates we find that even those that deal the most mildly with him as naudaeus and maraviglia deny any voice coming to him from without which the words in plato plainly and naturally import he had and i believe it must be granted me that the main ground these men and others of the same opinion go upon is that not having had any experience of any such thing in themselves and not being fully convinced that any other person has notwithstanding the testimonies of men in all ages and the instances i shall give they are uneasy to yield the point even in the case of socrates and i must here say i have hundreds of times seen heard and conversed with those they call genii angels spirits or demons appearing to me in humane shapes of which i shall give some relation beneath beside the experiences of many other persons known to me and now living in the same kind whom opposers notwithstanding any reluctance must give me leave to believe to be men of as sound sense as themselves  when such persons of an over cautious belief meet with any thing in history or hear something related in this kind we find they proceed two ways either being somewhat tender of the authority such things are delivered by they excogitate various explications of the fact as each mans fancy suggests to him so that they will allow somewhat of truth in it after the way they explain it as we find in the case of socrates naudaeus and maraviglia have done which is like the complement young philosophers have been taught to pay to aristotle in distinguishing his text when it has seemed to make against them or they flatly deny it and explode it as a fable with dr van dale gallaeus and many others as any man may easily do of any historical fact however attested since it will not bear a demonstrative proof and boldly cry out affirmanti incumbit probatio  it was a laudable undertaking of naudaeus to write an apology for all the great men accused of magic by some narrow understandings and which i think he has generally well performed but as to his way of apologizing for the men abovementioned i cannot see how it should abate of their merit or of the obligation we have to them for the works they have left us as he seems to think it would though they had received a good part of their knowledge from the suggestion of intellectual beings for the world has been long under a mistake if prophetic learning which beside what has been immediately inspired from the prime cause men may have sometimes had by a suggestion from intelligences be not of as great a merit and has not laid as great obligations on mankind as any excogitated by humane wit and we are as well owing to the prime cause for what we deliver by our ordinary faculties as for what in this extraordinary way  again though the primary end of good angels in directing mankind be in things relating to their eternal salvation yet i know not why they may not sometimes inspire or openly direct them in humane studies and in things relating to humane life so they are of a good tendncy as i find not but the knowledge of socrates and that of others whom i shall mention beneath were though that some have had knowledge inspired them by evil spirits its what divines generally teach neither shall i here take upon me to maintain that the genii which attended some of the persons above mentioned by naudaeus if they had any were of the better sort  there is one thing i shall note in naudaeuss account of the demon of socrates viz where he tells us plutarch said it was a sneezing on the right or left side according to which socrates foretold a good or evil event to the thing undertaken now though plutarch in his academical way of writing in his tract of socratess demon introduces one polymnis who set forth this opinion viz that socrates was guided in his judgment by a sneezing happening to himself or some stander by yet i see no color of reason why this opinion should be fathered upon plutarch himself more than others there set forth mr bogan though otherwise a learned man in his additions to mr rousss archeologiae atticae seems to me a little overcomical in sporting with socrates and his genius saying l   sect   c   socrates as emuncte naris as he was had so little sense himself as to fetch advice himself from another mans nose and to make a sneeze serve instead of a genius or daemonium to tell him the good and the bad etc but all men are not admirers of pedantick railery  to come to maraviglia we find he will have it according to his prejudice that socratess genius was only his pretense to gain authority to the doctrine he delivered though still he allows somewhat extraordinary in him that may be called his genius viz the wonderful sagacity of his mind cultivated by a long meditation which might in a particular manner have directed his judgment as to present and future things but i think this suspicion of socratess design in his gaenius is poorly grounded since it no way appears that ever socrates imputed the doctrine he delivered to the suggestion of his genius as numa and others did but only his being withheld by him from doing some actions which would have proved prejudicial to him  as for dr van dale he allows socrates no more than other men and wholly rejects his genius as not being well attested and charges christians and pagans for having over rashly believed and delivered as a truth the story concerning him  now as to this with reverence to the learning of so great a man i must take freedom to say it seems to me he has overdone the matter in this case by pressing things too far as i conceive he has in several other parts of his works for as to his rejecting the testimonies of xenophon and plato as not worth minding i believe by unprejudiced readers they may be looked upon as unexceptionable testimonies in that matter as any two men now living on the face of the earth for what they shall deliver by hearsay if we shall be led by suspicions and remote possibilities of fraud and contrivance of such men all historical truth shall be eluded when it consists not with a mans private humor or prejudice to admit it as for what he further urges that if we believe socratess boast as he calls it of his demon we may as well believe pythagoras who said he was first aethalides then euphorbus etc before he came to be pythagoras i think there is a great disparity in the case for as to divine voices being heard its no more than what all the ancient prophets testified besides what we find recorded of them in all christian and pagan histories nor are living testimonies wanting whereas for the other its well known how all the learned have expounded the pythagorean transmygration concerning which the very learned joan reuchlin writes thus de art cab l   the pythagorean metempsycosis signified nothing among the truly learned but a similitude of notions and studies which were formerly in some men and afterward sprung up again in others and so it was formerly said that euphorbus was reborn in pythagoras because that warlike valor which was celebrated in the trojan euphorbus some way appeared again in pythagoras by reason of the love he bore to the athletae or those that gave themselves to manlike exercises fcinus also testifies the same affirming in ep that the transmigration also as it respects brutes and men according to the sense of all the learned platonicks except pltinus imported only that as affects of brutes became habituated in men man seemed to have past into their natures but if dr van dale will have it that pythagoras declared this as a truth in a litteral sense when he shall produce some others who have declared the like experience of a transmigration in themselves as i have given instances backing what is said of socrates we may allow it a like motive of credibility and if the opinion of origin whom the dr praises as more discreet in his opinion concerning the pagan oracles l de orac dissert   c   than the other primitive fathers weighs any thing with him he will find him pretty smart against those that reject the genius of socrates where he says nor will there ever be wanting calumny to the uncandid contra else l   who have a malicious sense even of the best of men since they make a sport even of the genius of socrates as a thing feigned  since i have intimated it above i shall here give a farther instance or two of this learned persons overarguing himself as i conceive in the third chapter of his first dissertation treating of the origin of oracles where he writes against the imposture of the gentiles in that kind he charges them for having contrived generally the seats of their oracles on mountains where were caves and subterraneous vaults partly made by nature partly by art for carrying on their cheats and that none but kings princes and great men conscious of the cheat were admitted to consult them now if any of the gentiles who had a belief in their oracles as i think it beyond dispute that many even of the most learned of them had nay if they knew them to be cheats as some thought them to be would they not presently reply that a mountain was made choice of for moses to receive the law of god and that no man under pain of death was to approach the mountain but himself and aaron and likewise that the jews kept their sanctum sanctorum altogether as private and as liable to a suspicion of a cheat and admitted none but the prince the senate or some great person to consult the oracle of urim and thummim and the high priest only saw the sign of god in the brestplate directing an answer as the learned joan leusden has set forth in his philologus hebro mixtus disser   so that we find the force of this argument wholly evacuated it pressing equally on both sides and i am sorry i must say it i find too many arguments made use of by some writers against the religion of the gentiles which fall indirectly i will not say designedly on all religion  again the said author chapter   in his tract de divinatione idololatrica after having told us of the superstitious practice of the gentiles in driving away the lemures with a noise of brass adds those that will believe these things may as well believe what pliny writes viz above all things that have ever been heard of l    c    is the prodigy happening in our time by a ruin in the marrucine territories where the olivefield of vectius marcellus a chief person of the equestral order past over the whole common road and on the contrary plowed lands came thence into the olivefield now this seemed very strange to pliny who though an admirer of great things and a man excellently qualified for recording historical facts was never looked upon by the learned as a diligent enquirer into causes and wholly incredible to the author though i think it no such extraordinary phenomenon of nature there being several instances to be given of the like kind as well within our nation as elsewhere  stow tell us in his summary that an      jan the    th at hermitage in dorcetshire a piece of ground of three acres removed from its place and was carried over another close where alders and willows grew the space of forty rods or perches and stopped up the highway that leads to cirne a market town and yet the hedges it was enclosed with enclose it still and the trees stand bolt upright and the place where the ground was before is left a pit so an      marcleyhill in the east part of herefordshire with a roaring noise removed it self from the place where it stood and for three days together traveled from its old seat it began first to remove febr the    th being saturday at six of the clock in the evening and by seven of the clock the next morning it had gone forty paces carrying with it sheep in their folds hedgerows and trees whereof some were overturned and some that stood upon the plain are firmly growing upon the hill those that were east were turned west and those in the west were set in the east in this remove it overthrew kinnastonchappel and turned two highways near an hundred yards from their old course the ground that thus removed was about    acres which opening it self with rocks and all bore the earth before it  00 yards space without any stay leaving pasturage in the place of the tillage and the tillage overspread with pasturage at last overwhelming its lower parts it mounted to an hill of twelve fathoms high and so rested after three days travel more instances may be given of the same nature this being wrought by that kind of earthquakes we call brastae or brasmatis from  ferveo bullio vi aestus eficio which raise and protrude the earth many islands having been so cast up from the bottom of the sea on a sudden as for the ploughd lands coming in the place of the olivefield we may easily conceive this to have happened by a gyrative motion of that piece of land following upon the protrusion from the deep  i intimate these things only to caution men not to be over hasty in rejecting things that may seem strange and do not presently fall within their comprehension and that in opposing adversaries they use due circumspection in attending to the vast extent of the power of nature and the various manifestations of god in men many things being evident to some persons which to others seem wholly incredible  in the last place as for the suggestions of monsieur le loyer viz that plato had his notion of socratess genius from the egyptians etc i think them altogether groundless since pythagoras who lived before socrates is averred to have made his great proficiency in learning from his converse with spirits and since it was so usual a thing for the pythagoreans to see spirits as apuleius acquaints us and why must it be an evil genius bringing socrates to an unhappy end if we believe plato we find socrates did not think it so but on the contrary was desirous to die and i think no considering man who has lived an upright life would think it an unhappy thing to be freed from the grievances of decrepit age socrates according to the lowest computation being  0 yeas of age when he died suidas says  0 others  0 and as for his being a magician this need not to have been feigned to procure him a genius since his demon is said to have attended him from his infancy and so much concerning the genius of socrates  i shall now proceed to give an account from naudaeus of the genii ascribed to the other men beforementioned by him as for the genius of aristotle he thinks it a jest in those men that have ascribed one to him it being manifest according to all his interpreters that he never admitted other intelligences but those he assigned as movers to each sphere of the heavens rejecting all other kinds of demons so standing firm to his principles and not admitting any thing that was not known to him either by motion or operation he likewise referring all that is wont to be ascribed to demons to nature that is to the properties of natural things to humors and temperaments of animals to the nature of places and to their vapors and exhalations leaving nothing to do for these substances and after naudaeus has given several reasons against aristotles admitting of demons he adds i think one probable argument may be drawn from his book concerning divination by dreams where to show that there is nothing supernatural in them he says but because some animals likewise dream certainly dreams are not sent from god nor caused by him but must be daemonical since nature is daemonical not divine and though it be greatly controverted among interpreters and commentators in comment in hurclos in c    alvin digress   in what sense we must explain this epithet given by aristotle to nature it seems leonicus has better hit on it than the others and that the learned charpentarius has found the whole energy of this phrase when he says aristotle would show by it that that force may be found in nature well ordered depending on the conversion of the celestial orbs which may serve to explain all those things for which others have recourse to demons by the means of which explication he says he may answer the sole reason given by caesalpinus l de invest daem perip c   for establishing demons according to the doctrine of aristotle  in reference therefore to the genius of aristotle ascribed to him by some persons i shall set down what piccolomini and caesalpinus have writ concerning his opinion as to the existence of demons the former contending against his admission of them the latter for it and shall subjoyn my own sense in the matter  piccolomini states the case l de invest daem paerip whether aristotle thought there were demons and concludes in the negative writing as follows the word demon may be taken either metaphorically or properly if metaphorically aristotle may be allowed to have granted demons he saying   top loc    that xenocrates affirms him to be an eudaemon who has a studious mind for this is to each man an eudaemon so we may also say with aristotle that the mind coming from without and governing a man is his eudaemon so in his book of divination by dreams he says that dreams are not sent by god but are daemonical because nature is daemonical not divine intimating that nature by a metaphor may be called a demon which name agrees to it because it is gods messenger is powerful and works secretly and wonderfully all which things are ascribed to demons so when the name of demon is given to a part of the mind leading us we may say with aristotle that two demons are born and live with us viz reason and the sensual appetite and he that is led by right reason is led by a good demon and he that is led by anger or concupiscence is carried away by an evil demon but the doubt is concerning a demon properly taken whether it be a demon by its nature or a foregin demon the former of which may be aptly enough defined to be an animal having a reason and understanding superior to man using a subtle body and mediating betwixt god and man the latter is the soul of a man departed this life being freed from the gross body and using a subtle vehicle and in this sense aristotle did not think there were demons not demons by nature first because as he professed to explain all particular degrees of things to set forth a complete philosophy he no where speaks of demons secondly in his third book of the soul he plainly rejects them test    setting forth that no animal can consist either of air or fire or any other simple body though he makes particular mention of air and fire because the academicks thought the bodies of demons to be aerie and in some sort fiery but to pass by many other passages of aristotle against demons he thinks this a most firm reason that there is nothing in the universe in vain speaking of the degrees and species of things whereas if there were demons they would be of no use according to aristotle which hence appears because all those things which are commonly judged works of demons are ascribed by him to other causes never any to demons for those things which excited the ancient philosophers to excogitate demons were chiefly divinations by dreams which aristotle ascribed to nature the various kinds of furies or raptures which he attributes to a various temperament of melancholy the answers of oracles which he refers to the property of certain steams proceeding from the cavities of the earth the saying of a verse by an ignorant person which aristotle likewise refers to melancholy since therefore philosophers are raised by works to the search of causes and aristotle ascribed all those works to other causes and not to demons we gather he thought there were none and so as to foreign demons or the souls of men separated from the body aristotle held there were none for in his second book of the soul he says text    there is no soul without the body and in the seventh of his metaphysics he says there is no man without flesh and bones and in his second book of the generation of animals he says cap    there is no instrument without a faculty nor an organical faculty without an instrument now the soul of man is organical etc  caesalpinus after having quoted plato l de invest daem perip cap   introducing socrates concluding against his calumniators who charged him of admitting no gods that he that grants there are daemonical works of necessity admits demons which are either gods or sons of gods in his seventh chapter he writes thus we may gather in aristotle that there are demons by that argument by which socrates gathered there were he that asserts there are daemonical works is compelled of necessity to confess there are demons aristotle asserts there are daemonical works viz dreams and nature therefore of necessity he must confess there are demons whence they are so denominated and the philosopher seems to have understood that middle nature betwixt god and mortal things mentioned before by us to be a demon for when he had denied dreams to be sent by god as some thought they were because they happen not only to the wisest of men but indifferently to idiots and some other animals yet he says dreams are daemonical because nature is daemonical not divine though therefore somewhat divine be contained in nature yet it does not merit the name of divine but daemonical because it follows the wisdom of an intelligence whence it is rendered admirable even in the least things and dreams are daemonical by reason of the wonderful force of the imagination  now these two authors considered i think it may be agreed that aristotle did not admit a demon properly taken as piccolomini has set forth but he admitted the facts commonly ascribed to demons which he accounted for from other causes as we find by what is quoted from charpentarius by naudaeus according to which as naudaeus says caesalpinuss sole reason for establishing of demons according to aristotles doctrine may be solved yet however since aristotle admits the facts commonly ascribed to demons i see not why he may not properly enough be said to have had a genius though it may be explained by an intellectus agens coming from without or by an orderly influx from the intelligences that move the heavens he having a mind to set up for himself by an hypothesis of his own contrary to that of plato received before and which is more consonant to christianity nor can i think aristotles so plausible for solving phenomenon though it may more gratify the humor of some persons in reference to aristotles genius i may add what rhodiginus writes viz that among the ancients lct antiq l   c   plato had the symbol of divine given him and aristotle of daemonical the reason why aristotle was so styled seems to be that he chiefly treated of natural things the consideration of which lies in a manner in the sublunary world where they thought demons had their abode but plato raising himself higher being addicted to the contemplation of intelligible beings got him a more eminent guide of life and despising those things which others admired even to a madness he strove with all his force to bring that which is divine in us to that divine being which only is truly so whence he got his name of divine  naudaeus after he has rejected the genius of aristotle proceeds to the others but first tells us that what all the platonicks have set forth concerning demons and magic can neither be proved by reason nor experience and as for the reason they draw from many effects which they say must necessarily be referred to these causes before he obliges himself to receive it he first wishes they would well satisfy pomponatius cardan and bernardus mirandulanus who show pertinently enough that its better to have recourse to the proofs of our religion to believe angels and demons than to that heap of experiences of which a reason may be rendered by the principles of natural philosophy after which he says we ought no longer to make doubt but all that is said of the genii of plotinus porphyrius and jamblicus ought to be referred to what he has said before concerning the demon of socrates  to this i reply that even setting by the proofs of our religion for angels and demons i see not but as for solving the experiences he speaks of by natural principles aristotles hypothesis of intelligences moving the heavens is altogether as precarious and less satisfactory than the other used by others of the gentiles and as for his referring what is said of the genii of the three philosophers beforementioned to what he has said of the genius of socrates i think i have shown above that he has not validly refuted his demon  as to the genius of plotinus porphyrius his scholar who has writ his life which is prefixed to plotinuss works set forth with commentaries by ficinus says thus in it an egyptian priest coming to rome and being soon made known by a friend of his to plotinus and having a desire to show a specimen of his wisdom at rome persuaded plotinus to go along with him and he would presently show him his demon or familiar spirit whom plotinus readily obeyed the invocation of the demon was made in the temple of isis for plotinus said this was the sole place in rome which the egyptian sound pure but when the demon was called to present himself to his view instead of a demon a god appeared which was not of the species of demons the egyptian thereupon thus presently cried out you are happy o plotinus who have a god for your demon and have not light on a guide of an inferior kind plotinus therefore having a familiar of the order of divine demons it was with reason that he always sublimely raised the divine eye of his mind to that and for this reason he afterward composed a book concerning each mans particular demon where he endeavors diligently to assign the causes of the difference of familiar spirits porphyrius to show the divine spirit of his master plotinus adds beneath i had once thoughts of killing my self which plotinus wonderfully perceived and as i was walking in the house he presently came to me and said what you meditate o porphyrius is not like that of a sound mind but rather of a mind grown mad with melancholy and therefore he commanded me to depart from rome those that would read plotinuss tract concerning each mans familiar spirit may find it in his works  naudaeus proceeds next to the genii of chicus scaliger and cardan as for chicus he looks upon him by what he has writ as a superstitious person who affirmed he often made use of revelations from a spirit called floon which he said was of the order of the cherubims but naudaeus rejects this with other fabulous relations of other persons saying with lucretius quis dubitat quin omne sithoc rationis aegestas a short way of refuting  concerning the genii of scaliger and cardan naudaeus writes as follows if it were permitted me and it became me to follow rather my will than my duty i should freely excuse my self from saying any thing against the genii which the two sole great persons whom we may oppose to the two most learned and famous among the ancients have attributed to themselves and who have been as it were the last effort and miracle of nature scaliger and cardan for i certainly believe either they deceived themselves in admitting these genii because after having well examined themselves they could not find in them the cause of such and so extraordinary perfection or that they did it through modesty not to discover by their learning how much all the rest of mankind were inferior to them or finally that they would cover from envy under this particular assistance and free from the jealousy of men that great renown they had acquired to themselves by their studious diligence and labors however as truth is sooner found out when many persons employ themselves in the search of it the opinion of those is not to be rejected who say scaliger practiced this stratagem in imitation of all great persons and not to yield in ambition to his antagonist attributing to himself for a genius l   c    in his art of poetry a mere sally or emotion of mind by which the soul is heated as it were in it self to raise it to the knowledge of somewhat during which a man may at any time say and write many things which he understands not after the heat of this enthusiasm is over and as for cardan he speaks so variously of his genius that after having said absolutely in his dialogue entitled telion that he had one which was venereal mixed with saturn and mercury and in his book de libris propriis that he communicated himself to him by his dreams he doubts at the same place whether he had really one or whether it were the excellency of his nature i perceived said he whether it were from the genius set over me or that my nature is placed in the extremity of an human state and in the confines of the immortals etc and finally concludes in his book de rerum varietate that he had none frankly saying i truly know not that any demon or genius attends me whence we may surely judge that he and scaliger had no other genius but the great learning they had acquired by their diligence and labors and the experience they had of things on which coming to raise their judgments as on two pyramids they judged pertinently of all matters and let nothing escape from being known and manifest to them  we here see what conjectures naudaeus has made concerning the genii of these men which are as easily rejected as they are groundlesly suggested by him and though cardan says in his book de rerum varietate l    he knew no genius attended him we know that book was writ many years before he writ his life which was but a little before his death and on which i think we have most reason to rely where he plainly says he had a genius though not well discovered by him till his latter years and this book writ by cardan of his own life was set forth by naudaeus himself which makes it seem somewhat strange that he should deny he had any genius but for the readers satisfaction i shall here set down what these two great men say themselves of their genii and shall leave it to him to judge of it as he shall think fit  to pass by the genius of facius cardanus which his son hierom cardan says l de demon his father owned to have attended him for thirty years and where he gives an account of seven demons more whom he saw and converst with i here give you several particulars though not all which hierom cardan has left recorded concerning a genius that attended himself  in his book of his own life set forth by naudaeus c    where he writes of his good spirit he says its received as a manifest truth that familiar spirits which the greeks call angels have forewarned some men socrates plotinus synesius dion flavius josephus and even my self all lived happily besides socrates and my self who neverthelses am in a very good condition but c caesar the dictator cicero antony brutus and cassius had evil though illustrious spirits those of antony and cicero were glorious but both pernicious that of josephus was particularly famous and of a rare excellency for warlike valor favor with vespesian and his sons riches monuments of histories a threefold offspring and in his contest with the calamities of his nation also in a foresight of future things wherewith he was illustrated in captivity being freed from the outrage of his friends and preserved from the waves of the sea but these were manifestly demons though mine as i believe a good and merciful spirit i was long persuaded that i had one but could not find how he should certify me of imminent events till after the seventy fourth year of my age when i set upon writing my life but that so many imminent things should be foreknown to me and truly foreseen and that just before they happened and precisely seems to me a greater miracle to be done without a divine aid than with a spirit for instance when my spirit saw what was ready to befall me viz that my son was to marry the next day an unfortunate match in the nightime he raised such a beating of my heart by a way peculiarly known to him that the chamber seemed to tremble my son perceiving the same at the same time so that both of us thought there was an earthquake which no body else perceived  he adds beneath there may be some doubts why this care for me and not for others for i do not excel in learning as some think but happily on the contrary is it an immence love of truth and wisdom with contempt of riches even in this state of poverty or by reason of my desire of justice or that i ascribe all to god nothing to my self or happily for some end known to god alone  again why does he not openly admonish me as i could wish of those things of which he does admonish me but teaches one thing for another as by those disorderly noises  of which he gives several instances happening before deaths in his   d chapter of the same book for me to assure my self that god beholds all things though i see him not with my eyes for he could have admonished me openly by a dream or some clearer way of manifestation but happily this showed more the divine care and those greater things that happened to me fears impediments anxieties etc there is need also of obscurity for us to understand that they are the works of god and ought not to be opposed its folly therefore to be overhastily sollicitous for knowing these things  at the end of the same chapter he writes that having stuck to a splendour that attended him above forty years he had all his art of writing and public teaching from his spirit and splendor though this kind of science had got him among men more envy than renown and more glory than profit but it gave him no small nor vulgar pleasure and contributed to the prolonging of his life being a comfort to him in many calamities an aid in adversities an help in difficulties and labors upon the whole he says the fact was plainly so he might err in the causes and refers himself to such as are wiser viz divines  in the same book he writes thus hitherto i have spoken of my self chap    as of a man and that is somewhat beneath other men in my nature and learning but now i shall speak of some admirable disposition of my self and so much the more wonderful that i find somewhat in my self which i know not what to make off and that that thing is my self though i do not perceive such things to proceed from me that it is present when its meet and not when i will have it that which rises thence is greater than my abilities which was first discovered to me in the year      so that it is above forty four years since i perceive a thing from without enter into my ear with a noise from that part directly where people are talking of me if it tends to good in the right side or if it comes from the left it penetrates to the right and an orderly noise is made and if the discourse be contentious i hear a wonderful contention if it inclines to evil in the left side it comes exactly from the part where those tumultuous voices are therefore it enters on both sides of my head and very often when the thing falls out ill the voice on the left side when it should end grows louder and voices are multiplied and very commonly if the thing be in the same town it happens that the voice being scarce over a messenger comes in to call me to them and if it be from another city and a messenger comes upon computing the time betwixt the deliberation and the beginning of the journey they come to the same and i find sentence past after the form it is concluded and this continued with me to the year      and i wondered it ceased  in the year      i began to see in dreams what things would happen in a short time and if the same day i saw them clearly and after sun rising so that i saw a sentence past in a cause of the college and that i should be professor at bononia this ceased an       the third thing was a splendour this i increased by degrees it began about the year      or    but particularly this year      it seems to me i have it perfect and it is a thing which does not leave me but instead of the two foregoing which are ceased it fortifies me against emulators and as necessity requires its composed of an artifical practice and a circumfluent light being very pleasant and alone performs much more as to efficacy exercitation advantage and solidity of studies than those two joined together and does not take a man from his common studies and humane conversation but makes him ready at all things and is most excellent for composing books and seems as it were the utmost reach of our nature for it represents all things together that make for the matter under consideration and if it be not a divine thing certainly it is the most perfect of mortal works  chap    in the same book he writes as follows while i lived at pavia and professed physic there looking casually on my hand i saw at the root of my ring finger of my right hand the form of a bloody sword i was presently struck with a great fear in the evening a messenger came with a letter from my son in law acquainting me that my son was taken into custody and that i should come to milan the next day and for fifty three days the mark increased and went upwards and behold the last day reached to the top of my finger and looked red like a flaming sword i suspecting no such thing and being frighted and not my self knew not what to do say or think at midnight my son was beheaded in the morning the sign was almost gone in a day or two it wholly vanished  in the same book having given an account of some strange noises chap   and voices he had heard and of a strange smell he perceived before deaths he concludes thus but concning thse wonderful things it is thus with men tha when they are present or a little before they have happened they draw the whole man after they are a while over they are so little heeded that unless they are brought fresh to the mind by some force they doubt as it were whether they have seen or heard them which i suppose chiefly happens both by reason of much more profound causes and for the distance of our nature from the causes that produce them i know what scoffs and laughter some that would seem wise raise at such things the chief ring leader of whom is polybius a philosopher without philosophy who understood not even the duty of an historian but by extending it too far became ridiculous sometimes admirable as where he speaks of the achaeans in short l   hist tartalia rightly said that noman knows all things and those nothing that do not know their ignorance of many things you see pliny who has delivered so clear an history shows himself a blockhead where he treats of the sun and stars what wonder therefore that polybius while he meddles of the more sublime and divine things has so clearly exposed his ignorance i religiously swear that a sense and consciousness of only one of these things is more dear to me than a long lasting reign over the whole earth would be and beneath but let this suffice for i have only here set down in short when these things happened and how and such in which these could be no suspiscion of error or imposture and i only beg you reader when you read such things do not propose humane pride for your scope but the greatness and amplitude of the world and of the heavens and the vile darkness in which we live and you will easily understand i have related no incredible things the same author in his dialogue intitld tetim or of humane counsels where he makes tetim and ram interlocutors makes ram say i believe cardan has a genius for his companion which discovered himself late to him being wont before to admonish him by dreams and noises and beneath so many and so wonderful things have happened to him in his life that i am forced to believe being intimate with him he has a great powerful and rare genius so that he is not master of his actions but those things he desires he has not the things he has he did not covet or hope for  at the end of his fourth book of wisdom he writes as follows concerning the genii of other men all great men seem to be led by some divine spirit or demon socrates before his death had warning of the day in a dream dion saw a spectre in his house what was it opened caius caesars door the night before he was slain what was it said to brutus as he was alone i am thy evil genius thou shall see me again at philippi what was that august figure seen by cassius in his tent that was like to caesar what foretold sylla in his dream of his imminent death or what was it he heard so pleasant in a clear sky what from a mausolaeum called nero before his death what admonished caligula of his death in a dream why did antony hear the departure of bacchus from alexandria the night before his death what mixed a sleeping potion for adrian in a dream before his death certainly the demon that was in them for humane nature when highly exalted rises to the force of a demon these foresaw their deaths but could not prevent the violence of it neither are these the only persons who having this wisdom have had violent ends for paul who aided by the divine spirit could see the secrets of god and stephen the heavens open and philip who was carried invisible through the desert died all by the hands of others but there is this great difference betwixt these spirits that the divine is joined with justice and piety and the other virtues and has tranquillity and rest always attending it the daemonical is raised by murders robberies and falsedealings and is always accompanied with suspiscious and manifold disquiets who but a person of troubled senses and a discomposed mind would choose to embrace the daemonical but as in sick persons the vitiated taste abhors sweet and fat things and is more delighted with such as are sharp and insipid so the nature of mortals being corrupted with vice abhors the best and adheres to the worst and this is done chiefly by the likeness of these two kinds which how great it is may easily be understood by this that simon and elimas the magicians were accounted divine men and christ who was god was thought by many to have a devil and so much for cardan  scaliger l   c    speaking of the genius ascribed by virgil to anea viz achates so called from  writes thus of the genii that attend men we read in the books of the pythagoreans enricht by the platonicks that we have two genii attending us a good and a bad by the guidance and counsels of the good good and elect persons join themselves to god from whom they have received him as a mediator to some heroes he shows himself by others he is never seen but is heard which socrates professes of his in more than one place in plato by some divine spirits he is neither seen nor heard but so introduces and presents himself that by his light he discovers an intelligence of secret things for men to write wherefore it often happens that when that celestial heat is over in us we our selves either admire those our writings or do not own them for ours and do not understand some things after the way they were directed and dictated by him nor do i think it happened otherwise to plato to whose writings a light is added by interpreters much greater than may proceed from vulgar judgments as for my self who think i am not to be compared even with the least if any thing falls from me at any time unawares i may not hope so much may be performed by me afterward which is the reason i never set upon meditating or writing unless invited by my genius who speaks inwardly with me though not heard showing the spacious fields of the divinity in our minds which being abstracted and suspended from the offices of the body it deputes to other functions so that he did not speak wholly at random who thought that aristotles intellectus agens were the same with platos genius we have instances of both in history for an evil one appeared to brutus and foretold him an unhappy end a good one to caesar when he past rubicon showing him the way to that in which he placed his chief bliss etc  heinsius says in a manner in dedic hippon sui the same thing of himself with scaliger writing thus here are some things to which being my self i am not able to aspire which after the heat has left my mind i consider as a reader of another mans works exer     scaliger also elsewhere calls his genius most learned whose desire is vast and immence and heinsius says ib uninitiated persons do not understand these things  scaliger also on aristotle de plantis p    in f writes thus jamblicus in his mysteries says he that being inspired receives the deity has a sort of appearance of fire before its ingress and it is seen the god either coming or departing therefore those spirits that apply themselves to our mind with darkness bring us frivolous wavering and doubtful things and i know a person to whose eyes a fire presents it self often either meditating or expecting messengers  this is what scaliger and cardan have said concerning their own genii and those of others from which the judicious reader may easily discern their sense concerning them  chap iii what perception men have had of genii or spirits and their operations by the sight as i come now to give an account of the perception men have had of genii or spirits and their operations by their particular senses i shall begin with the most spiritualized sense viz the sight and set forth what perception men have had of them by that and whereas in my account according to the several senses it may sometimes happen that more than one sense may be concerned at one and the same time in a perception of them i shall entitle the chapters according to the predominant sense in that action and whereas it often happens that some particular persons have a perception of spirits both by the sight and hearing when other persons present perceive nothing i shall treat of these persons in particular chapters  to begin therefore with instances of persons perceiving spirits by the sight came panella tells us de sens rer l   c   there are angel guardians for each species and individual person as st hierom writes and himself has found by experience which he did not understand before  in the same work l   c    he tells us of a friend of his who was no ignorant nor timorous person nor given to speak untruths who assured him he had often seen and conversed with evil demons and he says he met with many others afterward who had been incredulous in this kind but upon their seeing and conversing with spirits changed their opinions and their lives  elsewhere he writes thus ib l   c   porphyrius and plotinus say there are angels good and bad as daily experience teaches and my self also have found by manifest experience not when i greatly endeavored it but when i was minding another thing and therefore it is no wonder if they did not appear to curious nero  in his atheismus triumphatus c    he also tells us of a friend of his that had a sensible experience of spirits whose voice he used to hear betwixt sleeping and waking and especially when any evil was to happen to him  father le brun printed a book two years  paris in french which has for title  critique des pratiques superstitieuses etc in the second part of this book chap   he writes concerning trithemius as follows the abbot tritmius after an ardent desire of know  unknown to all mankind learned such a were astonishing by a revelation which has no way the character of being divine i examine not whether all he said he had learnt be natural i know some persons pretend it but it is plain it was without making a due reflection however it may be i shall only speak of the manner after which trithemius learnt these secrets he writ it confidently to a carmelite father a friend of his called borstius who died at ghent before the letter came to him it was opened and communicated to many persons and trithemius did not disown it i have in hand says he in his letter a great work which will amuse the whole world if ever it sees the light it is divided into four books and the first has for title of it steganography the work throughout is full of great and astonishing things which man has never heard of and will seem incredible if you ask me how i learnt these things it is not by man but by the revelation of i know not what spirit for thinking on a day this year      if i could not discover secrets unknown to men after having a long while pondered on those i have mentioned and being at length persuaded that what i sought for was not possible i went to bed being somewhat ashamed for having carried my folly so far as to attempt an impossible thing in the nighttime some one presented himself to me and calling me by my name trithemius said he do not believe you have had all these thoughts in vain though the things you search are not possible to you nor to any other man they will become so teach me then i replied what i must do to succeed then he laid open the whole mystery and showed me that nothing was more easy god is my witness that i speak the truth and that i have taught these secrets but to a prince who by an evident proof has been convinced of the possibillity of it it imports that none but princes should know these sorts of secrets least traitors impostors or other ill men make use of them for doing many mischiefs  boissardus l de magia geniis and angelis c   mentions this letter of trithemius and says he there adds that he could teach all the things he had of the spirit in all the languages of the world and that he clears himself of the crime of magic and any commerce with evil spirits by a sacred oath and execration apol des grands homines etc p   c    naudaeus writes that trithemius indeed lay under a suspicion of magic on the account of that letter and endeavors to clear him of it but i leave it to the readers to consider what trithemiuss words import as to a conversation with some spirit be he good or bad  the same boissardus writes c   that an illustrious german count whom he knew professed he had a familiar spirit whom he affirmed to be of the celestial order whose counsel he used in all things he undertook at home and abroad  philip melancthon tells us l de anime that he had seen specter and that he knew many men worthy of credit who affirmed they had not only seen specter but had likewise discoursed with them so maximus tyrius says he saw aesculapius but it was in a slumber sermon    but hercules he saw as he was waking  there was a pamphlet printed in london anno      in quarto entitled a true and exact relation of the several informations examinations and confessions of the late witches arraigned and executed in the county of essex  who were arraigned and condemned at the late sessions held at chelmsford before the right honorable robert earl of warwick and several of his majestys justices of the peace july the    th       before this sessions several informations concerning witches and their practices were taken before sir harbottel grimston and sir thomas bows his majestys justices of peace for the said county some of which informations are as follows  i the information of matthew hopkins of manningtree gent taken upon oath before us the   th of march      this informant says that the said elizabeth clarke alias beddingfield suspected for a witch as aforesaid and whose mother and some others of her kinsfolk did suffer death for witchcraft and murder being by appointment of the said justices watched several nights for the better discovery of her wicked practices this informant came into the room where the said elizabeth was watched as aforesaid the last night being the    th of this instant marc but intended not to have stayed long there but the said elizabeth forthwith told this informant and one mr stern there present if they would stay and do the said elizabeth no hurt she would call one of her white imp and play with it in her lap but this informant told her they would not allow of it but that staying there a while longer within a quarter of an hour after there appeared an imp like to a dog which was white with some sandy spots and seemed to be very fat and plump with very short legs and forthwith vanished away and the said elizbeth said the name of that imp was jarmra and immediately there appeared another imp which she called vinegar tom in the shape of a greyhound with long legs and the said elizabeth then said that the next imp should be a black imp and should come for the said mr stern which appeared but presently vanished and the last that appeared was in the shape of a polecat but the head somewhat bigger and the said elizabeth then told this informant that she had five imps of her own and two of the imps of the old bedlam west meaning one ann west widow who is now also suspected to be guilty of witchcraft and said sometimes the imps of the old bedlam sucked on the said elizabeth and sometimes her imps sucked on the old beldam west and the said elizabeth farther told this informant that satan would never let her be at rest or quiet till she did consent to the killing of the hogs of one mr edwards of mannintree and the horse of one robert tailor of the same town  ii the information of john stern gent taken upon oath before us the   th day of march      this informant says that watching with elizabeth clarke suspected for witchcraf as aforesaid she desired this informant and the rest that were in the room with her to sit down and said she would show this informant and the rest some of her imps and within half an hour there appeared a white thing in the likeness of a cat but not altogether so big and being asked if she would not be afraid of her imps she answered what do you think i am afraid of my children and that she called the name of that white imp hoult and this informant farther says that presently after there appeared another white imp with red spots as big as a small dog which she then called jarmara and that immediately after there appeared at the threshold of the door another imp about the bigness of the first but did presently vanish away and then the said elizabeth being asked if any more imps would come she answered that vinegar tom would come by and by and forthwith there appeared another in the likeness of a dumb dog somewhat bigger than any of the former and the said elizabeth also told this informant that she had three imps from her mother which were of a brown color and two from the old beldam west and that there had five imps appeared but she had one more called sack and sugar which had been hard at work and it would be long before it came but it should tear this informant  iii the information of frances mills grace norman mary phillips and mary parsley taken upon oath before the said justices the   th day of march      these informants say jointly that watching with the said elizabeth clarke suspected as aforesaid about twelve of the clock last night the said elizabeth smackd with her mouth and beckoned with her hand and instantly there appeared a white thing about the bigness of a cat and that these informants saw five imps more which the said elizabeth named as abovesaid etc  iv the information of edward parsley of mannintree taken upon oath before the said justices the   th of march      this informant says that watching with the said elizabeth clarke the last night he asked her if he should continue still in the room with her and the said elizabeth desired he should if he would fight for her with the devils for they would come this night and that which she called hoult would come first and then that which she called jarmara which did appear in the likeness of a white dog with red spots and presently after there appeared that imp which she called vinegar tom and then that which she called sack and sugar and the said elizabeth then told this informant that the devil had had possession of her six or seven years and that he had oftentimes knocked at her door in the nightime and that she did rise open the door and let him in and that he went to bed to her three or four times a week and had the carnal knowledge of her as a man  v the information of john banks of mannintree taken upon oath before the said justices the   th of march      this informant says that watching with the said elizabeth clarke he did inform and confirm all the particulars expressed and set down in the information of the said mr stern    to the five informations before set down i shall add the examination of ann leech of misley in the county aforesaid widow taken before the said justices april the    th      as follows  this examinant says that she had a gray imp sent her and that she together with elizabeth clarke and elizabeth gooding did about a year since fend their imps to kill a black cow and a white cow belonging to mr edwards which was done accordingly and says that she sent her gray imp elizabeth clarke a black imp and elizabeth gooding a white imp and that about  0 years since she sent a gray imp to kill two horses of one mr bragg of misley which were killed accordingly that she and the said elizabeth gooding sent either of them an imp to destroy the child of the said mr edwards this examinants imp being a white one and elizabeth goodings a black imp and that about thirty years since this examinant had the said white imp and two others a gray and a black imp of one anne the wife of robert pierce of stoake in suffolk being her brother and that these imps went commonly from one to another and did mischief wherever they went and that when this examinant did not employ them abroad to do mischief she had not her health but when they were employed she was healthful and well and these imps did usually suck those teats which were found about the privy parts of her body and that those imps did often speak to this examinant and that in an hollow voice which she plainly understood etc she was executed at chelmsford as also elizabeth clarke before mentioned  now as to the five informations before set down in which eight persons are concerned all given in upon oath that they saw such imps as they mention i cannot well conceive what an opposer of any real apparitions of spirits can say for here i do not tell you of afflicted persons who pretended to see specter which were seen by none but themselves nor of an old distracted woman who fancies she has and sees spirits attending her when there is no such thing nor do i give you the testimonies of crafty melancholy wenches or old women as some such there may have been but here are the testimonies of eight unexceptionable persons as i conceive concurring in one thing and if this be not a fair proof i know not what is so  as to the examination of anne leech concerning her imps though the fact stands but upon her testimony yet in regard it relates to somewhat that i shall write elsewhere in this book i thought fit to insert it and i here forbear to insert the spirits raised by mrs bodman who was executed at salisbury for which fact there was also but one testimony  sometime since i drew the account before set down from the forementioned pamphlet printed anno      i casually met with a pamphlet published in london anno      by mr stearne above mentioned the title of it is a confirmation and discovery of witchcraft etc by john stearne now of lawshall near bury st edmonds in suffolk sometimes of manningtree in essex  in this pamphlet among other things he gives an account of the facts abovementitiond as follows  mr hopkin and my self went together to elizabeth clarke of manningtree in essex who had been kept three days and three nights under a guard and when i had asked her who she had accused as witches we were going away but she said to us if you will stay i will show you my imps for they are ready to come then said mr hopkin besse will you do us no harm no said she what do you think i am afraid of my children you shall sit down so we did where she appointed us then one of the company who was appointed to be with her that night said to her besse i asked you a question of late but you answered not then she said what is it he replied tell the truth has not the devil had the use of your body she said why should you ask me such a question he answered i desire to know the truth and no otherwise then she fetched a deep sigh and said it is true then said mr hopkin in what manner and likeness came he to you she said like a tall proper blackhaird gentleman a properer man than your self and being asked which she had rather lie withal she said the devil and so particularized every thing and how he came in and his habit and how he lay with her and spoke to her and she then affirmed this to be truth and so presently fell a smacking with her lips and called lought two or three times which presently appeared to us eight for there were six which were appointed to be with her that night before we went in the likeness of a cat for she told us before in what shapes they would come and so that presently vanished then she called again as before jarmara then appeared another like a red or sandy spotted dog with legs not so long as a finger to our perceivance but his back as broad as two dogs or broader of that bigness and vanished after that she called more as before by several names which came in several shapes one like a greyhound with legs as long as a stags another like a ferrit and one like a rabbit and so in several shapes they appeared to us till there were some seven or eight seen some by some of us and others by other some of us then i asked her if they were not all come for there were more come than she spoke of she answered that they came double in several shapes but said one was still to come which was to tear me in pieces i asked her why she said because i would have had her tried by swimming and told me that now she would be even with me and so told in what manner it should come black and like a toad and so afterward it did come as the rest averred that saw it etc  this account we find somewhat differs from the former but whether enough to invalidate the testimony i must leave it to the readers consideration  mr glanvil in his collections of relations for proving apparitions spirits and witches tell us of an irishman that had like to have been carried away by spirits and of the ghost of a man who had been seven years dead that brought a medicine to his bedside the relation is thus  a gentleman in ireland near to the earl of orrerys sending his butler one afternoon to buy cards as he passed a field to his wonder he espied a company of people sitting round a table with a deal of good cheer before them in the midst of the field and he going up toward them they all arose and saluted him and desired him to sit down with them but one of them whispered these words in his ear do nothing this company invites you to hereupon he refused to sit down at the table and immediately table and all that belonged to it were gone and the company are now dancing and playing upon musical instruments and the butler being desired to join himself with them but he refusing this also they all fall to work and he not being to be prevailed with to accompany them in working any more than in feasting or dancing they all disappeared and the butler is now alone but instead of going forwards home he returns as fast as he could drive in a great consternation and was no sooner entered his masters door but falls down and lay sometime senseless but coming again to himself he related to his master what had passed  the night following there comes one of this company to his bedside and tells him that if he offered to stir out of doors the next day he would be carried away hereupon he kept within but toward the evening having need to make water he adventured to put one foot over the threshold several standing by which he had no sooner done but they espied a rope cast about his middle and the poor man was hurried away with great swiftness they following him as fast as they could but could not overtake him at length they espied an horseman coming toward him and made signs to him to stop the man whom he saw coming near him and both ends of the rope but no body drawing when they met he laid hold on one end of the rope and immediately had a smart blow given him over his arm with the other end but by this means the man was stopped and the horseman brought him back with him  the earl of orrery hearing of these strange passages sent to the master to desire him to send this man to his house which he accordingly did and the morning following or quickly after he told the earl that his spectre had been with him again and assured him that that day he should most certainly be carried away and that no endeavors should avail to the saving of him upon this he was kept in a large room with a considerable number of persons to guard him among whom was the famous stroker mr greatrix who was a neighbor there were beside other persons of quality two bishops in the house at the same time who were consulted concerning the making use of a medicine the spectre or ghost prescribed of which mention will be made anon but they determined on the negative  till part of the afternoon were spent all was quiet but at length he was perceived to rise from the ground whereupon mr greatrix and another lusty man clapped their arms over his shoulders one of them before him and the other behind and weighed him down with all their strength but he was forcibly taken up from them and they were too weak to keep their hold and for a considerable time he was carried in the air to and fro over their heads several of the company still running under him to prevent his receiving hurt if he should fall at length he fell and was caught before he came to the ground and had by that means no hurt  all being quiet till bed time my lord ordered two of his servants to lie with him and the next morning he told his lordship that his spectre was again with him and brought a wooden dish with gray liquor in it and bid him drink it off at the first sight of the spectre he said he endeavored to awake his bedfellows but it told him that that endeavor should be in vain and that he had no cause to fear him he being his friend and he that at first gave him the good advice in the field which had he not followed he had been before now perfectly in the power of the company he saw there he added that he concluded it was impossible but that he should have been carried away the day before there being so strong a combination against him but now he could assure him that there would be more attempts of that nature but he being troubled with two sorts of sad fits he had brought that liquor to cure him of them and bid him drink it he peremptorily refusing the spectre was angry and upbraided him with great disingenuity but told him however he had a kindness for him and that if he would take plantane juice he should be well of one sort of fits but he should carry the other to his grave the poor man having by this time somewhat recovered himself asked the spectre whether by the juice of plantane he meant that of the leaves or roots it replied the roots  then it asked him whether he did not know him he aswered no it replied i am such an one the man answered he had been long dead i have been dead said the spectre or ghost seven years and you know that i lived a loose life and ever since i have been hurried up and down in a restless condition with the company you saw and shall be to the day of judgment then he proceeded to tell him that had he acknowledged god in his ways he had not suffered such severe things by their means and further said you never prayed to god that day before you met with this company in the fields  this relation was sent to dr henry more by mr e fowler who said mr greatrix told it several persons the lord orrery also owned the truth of it and mr greatrix told it to dr henry more himself who particularly enquired of mr greatrix about the mans being carried up into the air above mens heads in the room and he did expressly affirm he was an eyewitness thereof  wierus tells us that a young woman de prestig daem l   c    was miserably tormented with an evil spirit in the castle of caldenbroc in guelderland and had been carried away in the air by him if himself had not withheld her by violence he says also that at magdeburg a certain magical juggler l   c   who was wont to lead about a little horse for a show would let him walk about in a circle in an open theater and at the end of the show wld tell the company that he could get  little money among men and theref he would go up to heaven whereupon he wld throw a cord up in the air and the little horse would go up after it himself taking hold of the horses tail would follow him his wife taking hold of him would follow also and a maid servant would follow her and so mount up in the air as it were linked together the spectators standing in great admiration till a certain citizen coming by chance that way and asking what was done it was answered that a jugler with his little horse was gone up into the air whereupon he assured them that he saw him just before going into an inn in the street therefore finding themselves deluded they went away wierus adds no man may deny but all this kind of alliance with demons by whatever means gotten and all the way of these delusions is a pestiferous fraud introduced for the utter destruction of men  mr thomas tilson minister of aylesworth in kent in a letter dated july the   th      which he sent to the late mr baxter in london gives an account of an apparition at rochester which account mr baxter has printed in his historical discourse of apparitions and witches it is as follows  mary the wife of john goffe of rochester being afflicted with a long illness removed to her fathers house at westmulling which is about nine miles distant from her own there she died june the   th this present year      the day before her departure she grew very impatiently desirous to see her two children whom she had left at home to the care of a nurse she prayed her husband to hire an horse for she must go home and dye with the children when they persuaded her to the contray telling her she was not fit to be taken out of bed nor able to sit on horseback she entreated them however to try if i cannot sit said she i will lie along upon the horse for i must go to see my poor babes  a minister who lives in the town was with her at ten of the clock that night to whom she expressed good hopes in the mercies of god and willingness to die but said she it is my misery that i cannot see my children  between one and two of the clock in the morning she fell into a trance one widow turner who watched with her that night says that her eyes were open and fixed and her jaw fallen she put her hand upon her mouth and nostrils but could perceive no breath she thought her to be in a fit and doubted whether she were alive or dead  the next day this dying woman told her mother that she had been at home with her children that is impossible said the mother for you have been here in bed all the while yes replied the other but i was with them last night when i was a sleep  the nurse at rochester widow alexander by name affirms and says she will take her oath on it before a magistrate and receive the sacrament upon it that a little before two of the clock that morning she saw the likeness of the said mary goffe come out of the next chamber where the elder child lay in a bed by it self the door being left open and stood by her bedside about a quarter of an hour the younger child was there lying by her her eyes moved and her mouth went but she said nothing the nurse moreover says that she was perfectly awake it was then daylight being one of the longest days in the year she sat up in her bed and looked steadfastly upon the apparition in that time she heard the bridge clock strike two and a while after said in the name of the father son and holy ghost what art thou thereupon the appearance removed and went away she slipped on her clothes and followed but what became on it she cannot tell then and not before she began to be grievously affrighted and went out of doors and walked upon the wharf the house being just by the river side for some hours only going in now and then to look to the children at five of the clock she went to a neighbors house and knocked at the door but they would not rise at six she went again then they arose and let her in she related to them all that had passed they would persuade her she was mistaken or dreamt but she confidently affirmed if ever i saw her in all my life i saw her this night  one of those to whom she made the relation mary the wife of john sweet had a messenger came from mulling that forenoon to let her know her neighbor goffes wife was dying and desired to speak with her she went over the same day and found her departing the mother among other discourse related to her how much her daughter had longed to see the children and said she had seen them this brought to mrs sweets mind what the nurse had told her that morning for till then she had not thought to mention it but disguised it rather as the womans disturbed imagination  the substance of this i had related to me by john carpenter the father of the deceased next day after her burial july the   d i fully discoursed the matter with the nurse and two neighbors to whose house she went that morning  two days after i had it from the mother the minister that was with her in the evening and the woman that sat up with her that last night they all agree in the same story and every one strengthns the others testimony  they appear to be sober intelligent persons far enough from designing to impose a cheat on the world or to manage a lie and what temptation they lie under for so doing i cannot conceive so far the letter to mr baxter  according to the foregoing instance helmont tell us of a boy who through an excussive desire of seeing his mother fell into an ecstasy and gave her a visit she being many miles distant from him and that upon his coming to himself remembering all things he gave people many marks of his having been with her marcus marci phys vet rest part   having set down this relation from helmont adds though we should grant the boys mind or imagination had reached to that place it would be ridiculous to think he could have perceived those sensible things being present unless we likewise admit the organs of his senses also with which he could have received those images had passed thither therefore we must say that as the imaginative faculty comes sometimes to the knowledge of future things so it does to the knowledge of things absent and as for the manner after which it is done he has explained it elsewhere  captain henry bell in his narrative prefixed to luthers table printed in english an      having acquainted us how the german copy printed of it had been discovered under ground where it had lain hid fifty two years that edition having been suppressed by an edict of the emperor rudolphus the second so that it was death for any person to keep a copy thereof and having told us that casparus van sparr a german gentleman with whom he was familiarly acquainted while he negotiated affairs in germany for king james the first was the person that discovered it an      and transmitted it into england to him and earnestly desired him to translate the said book into english says he accordingly set upon the translation of it many times but was always hindered from proceeding in it by some intervening business about six weeks after he had received the copy being in bed with his wife one night between twelve and one of the clock she being asleep but himself awake there appeared to him an ancient man standing at his bedsside arrayed all in white having a long and broad white beard hanging down to his girdle who taking him by his right ear said thus to him sirrah will not you take time to translate that book which is sent unto you out of germany i will shortly provide for you both place and time to do it and then he vanished hereupon being much affrighted he fell into an extreme sweat so that his wife awaking and finding him all over wet she asked him what he ailed he told her what he had seen and heard but he never regarded visions nor dreams and so the the same fell out of his mind but a fortnight after being on a sunday at his lodging in kingstreet westminster at dinner with his wife two messengers were sent from the whole counsel board with a warrant to carry him to the gatehouse westminister there to be kept till farther order from the lords of the council upon which warrant he was kept there ten whole years close prisoner where he spent five years of it in translating the said book having good cause to be mindful of the oldmans saying i will shortly provide for you both place and time to translate it  cardan tells us that jacobus donatus de rer variet l    c    a rich senator of venice was wont to relate how himself being in bed with his wife one night and having a wax candle burning by him and two nurses at the same time lying there in a trucklebed with a child under a year old he saw the chamber door to be opened by degrees and i know not what man to put his head in the nurses saw him too but neither knew his face the young man being affrighted arose and snatched his sword and buckler and the nurses each of them great wax candles he goes into the hall adjoining to the chamber there he found all things fast shut he returned with great admiration the infant who was well in health dyed the next day this he never related without sighing  we have also several instances in history of frightful specter appearing before pestilences and other afflictions procopius where he writes of the great and wonderful pestilence de bell pes l   that in the time of cosree and justinian dispopld the earth says there were then seen publicly and in private houses demons in an humane shape which struck those they met and those they struck were presently seized with the disease and this happened to some waking in open day to others in the night time  chap iv what perception some persons have had of genii or spirits by the sense of seeing when others present at the same time have seen nothing lucas jacobson debes m a and provost of the churches in the seventeen islands of foeroe subject to the king of denmark in his description of the said islands and inhabitants and his account of several observables there in his eighth chapter tells us how satan even since the pure light of the gospel there as well as before has behaved himself in deluding and seducing those inhabitants they having many examples how he has taken away some and carried away others restoring them afterward but weakened in their understandings whereof he gives us some certain relations that are yet in the memory of man and some others that happened while he himself was at foeroe he tell us that apparitions of spirits is a thing so generally known in foeroe that almost every where in the country where they have read no books thereof nor heard any relation from other places know it so perfectly by the works and apparations of satan that they are in no doubt at all of it and that they may be seen by some persons and not by others might be proved by many examples in foeroe that being a mere endowment of their nature and he says people grow much altered upon seeing such apparitions which apparitions they call hollow men an expression exactly agreeing with that of virgil where he tells us what the sybil aen   who undertook to carry aenas to the elysian fields said to him at the entrance of hell where the ghosts came against him et ni docta comes tenues sine corpore vitas admoneat volitare cava sub imagine formae irruat and frustra ferro dinverberet umbras and such they always appeared to my self not with solid bodies of flesh and bones  for particulars i refer the reader to mr debess book and shall only set down one relation from him of a thing which happened an      it is as follows a person called jacob oluffon being then at giow in osteroe in the   th year of his age on the    th of jan fell into a sickness lying a bed during a fortnight and on the    th day of his illness as he lay asleep at night there came one into him with shining clothes on whereat he awakened and perceived him in that figure in the bed by him the room appearing full of splendour and it asked the man where his pain was whereunto he answered nothing afterward the apparition stroakd him with his hand along his breast and round about whereby he was presently healed  now though daemonologers generally give instances of some persons seeing spirits when others in the same room at the same time see them not and some men undertake by physiognomy to tell who shall have visions of spirits or angels and who shall never see apparitions of them though they are in the room with others that see them yet the most convincing instance of this peculiar sight that i know of in the world is that of the second sighted persons in scotland who are called second sighted because they have the gift of seeing more than others can that are with them  my late friend mr john aubrey at the end of his book of miscellanies printed in london an      gives an account of these second sighted persons which was sent him from a learned person in scotland whose letters he showed me before he printed them and i shall here set down a few particulars taken from that account relating to my purpose  i they generally term this second sight in irish taishitaraugh and such as have it taishatrim from taish which is properly a shadowy substance and such as can only be some way discerned by the eye but not laid hold on by the hands for which they assigned it to bugles or ghosts so that taishtar is as much as one that converses with ghosts or spirits or as they commonly call them the  or fairyfolks others call these persons sichin from phis which is properly foresight or foreknowledge  ii those that have the second sight see a multitude of men and women night and day round about them and a particular relation is made of one of those persons a man of an upright conversation who used ordinarily by looking to the fire to foretell what strangers would come to his house the next day or shortly after by their habit and arms and sometimes also by their names and if any of his goods or cattle were missing he would direct his servants to the very place where to find them whether in a mire or upon dry ground he would also tell if the beast were already dead or if it should die ere they could come at it and in the winter if himself with others with him sat thick about the fireside he would desire them to make room for some others that stood by though they did not see them he saw two spirits continually and sometimes many more though others say he continually saw more and would often seem very angry and something troubled nothing visible to others moving him the two particular spirits that constantly attended him were called one brownie in the shape of a boy the other meig malloch or meg mullack in the shape of a girl who were two ghosts which as it is constantly reported of old haunted a family in straths pey of the name of grant of which name and family this person was  note l   c   that king james in his daemonology mentions also a spirit called brownie that was wont formerly to haunt diverse houses without doing any evil but doing as it were necessary turns up and down the house he appeared like a rough man nay some believed that their house was all the sonsier as they called it that is the more lucky or fortunate that such spirits resorted there  iii as to the extent of these peoples knowledge this secret way it reaches both present passed and future events they foresee murders drownings weddings burials combats manslaughters etc of all which there are many instances to be given they commonly foresee sad events a little while before they happen for instance if a mans fatal end be hanging they will see a gibbet or a rope about his neck if beheading they will see a man without a head if drowning they will see water up to his throat if stabbing they will see a dagger in his breast if unexpected death in his bed they will see a winding sheet about his head they foretell not only marriages but of good children what kind of life men shall lead and in what condition they shall die also riches honors preferments peace plenty and good weather there is one instance of a second sighted person who saw a young man attending a young gentlewoman as she went up and down the house and this was about three months before her marriage with him and sometimes they foretell things which fall out several years after it is likewise usual with persons that lose any thing to go to some of these men by whom they are directed how with what persons and in what place they shall find their goods it is also to be noted that this gift bears a latitude so that some have it in a far more eminent degree than others  iv as for the way of receiving this gift and communicating it to others the account tells us that in the isle of sky especially before the gospel came thither several families had it by succession descending from parents to children and as yet there are many that have it that way so cardan tell us it runs in a blood among the turks de rer varit l   c    for persons to cast themselves into an ecstasy at pleasure some say they get this gift by compact with the devil others say by converse with those demons we call fairies they say they can communicate the gift to others in a few days and have offered to do it for a small matter and they say that if at any time when they see those strange sights they set their foot on the foot of another who has not the second sight that other will for that time see what they are seeing and as i am told by a person who has conversed with those second sighted persons the gift will continue with the man that has so received it all his life  v this gift is very troublesome to those that have it and they would gladly be rid of it for if the object be a thing that is terrible they are seen to sweat and tremble and screek at the apparition at other times they laugh and tell of the thing cheerfully just according as the thing is pleasant or astonishing a certain person desired a second sighted mn to teach him his skill who told him he could do it in three days time but said he would not advise him or any man to learn it for upon learning it he would never be a minute in his life but he would see innumeble men and women night and day round about him which he believed would be troublesome to him whereupon the person would not learn it and those that have it wish to be rid of it judging it a sin and that it came from the devil and some of them have applied themselves to the ministry desiring their prayers for their being freed of it and they have been freed accordingly in the isle of sky if a woman has it her self and be married to a man that has it also unless a child of theirs be baptized just upon the delivery he has it all his life if he be then baptized he is freed from it  vi the persons that have this gift are observed for the most part to be vicious though some very honest persons of an upright life have it  mr aubrey in a small addition which he has nnext to his account of second sighted persons gives us a relation from diembroke l de peste of an old woman with whom it was usual where any friend of hers dyed to see their apparitions without an head and this though the persons were never so far off and i have been credibly informed of a gentleman in the low countries who as he walked the streets of a town would often meet people without heads as it seemed to him and would ask the next person he met with who such persons were and would acquaint his friends that those persons would die within a year which always came to pass  relating to this we find it is a custom with the jews on the  th day of their feast of tabernacles viz the   st day of the month of sept to go forth in the night time in the moonshine because they think all things that will happen to them that year are revealed to them that night in the moonshine leusden in his hilologus hebraeo mixtus dissert    has given us a cut of this practice which i have also here inserted where jews are going forth in the moonshine with branches of palms olives and willows in their hands to search out the events of the whole year but the head of one of them lies hid and is not seen in the shadow whence the person concludes he shall die that year buxtorf in his synagoga judaica chap    thus sets forth all these things they go forth in the night time in the moonshine some having only their heads bare some with a shirt on only or also naked having a sheet about them which they let fall and stretch forth their arms and hands if any mans head be seen wanting in the shadow he is in danger of life and it is a sign he will die that year if a finger be wanting the death of a friend is foreshown if the right hand a son if the left a daughter will die if he see no shade at all he must prepare for death for there is no hope of avoiding it and if he be upon undertaking a journey it is a sign he will never return home etc this the rabbis make out from the words numb     their shadow is departed from them but they write it is not to be understood of the simple shadow because it cannot be but a man must see his shadow in the moonshine but of the shadow of the shadow for if it be well minded we shall find a twofold shadow whereof the second is a reflection of the first which the rabbis call the shadow of the shadow  i know not how far this may relate to the doctrine of the cabaliss l de divin etc chap   for as bossardus tells us the arbian priests held with them that there are three parts of the soul the first is called neschama and is wholly divine abstracted and separated from the body this virgil calls aurai simplicis ignem aen   the second is called ruah and it is the rational soul which partakes of the divinity and the body joining both together with a wonderful harmony it gives life to the body and causes that it has not an abhorrence for the frail and mortal flesh in which it lives the third part of the soul is that which dissolves this harmony and it is as the idol image shadow and as the outcoat drawn from the surface of the body the cabalists call it nephes it wanders about sepulchers and is sometimes visible but to the eyes of those whom god illuminates and this nephes is that fatal hair in the crown of mens heads sacred to pluto and proserpine which before it be cut and drawn away from the crown of the head the soul cannot be separate from the body so also unless this nephes be drawn as it were from the outmost surface of the body a man cannot leave this life and this part of the soul if we believe the doctrine of the cabalists is that which is called out by magicians and necromancers pluto and proserpine being first appeased which if they put on their former bodies and such an habit as they wore alive their answers are called necromantical if they appeared only in flitting and subtle shadows their answers were said to be scyomantical so far boissardus whence i only note that if there be such a shadowy and wandering part of the soul as is here mentioned called nephes its probable the woman mentioned by diembroke saw that at the death of persons  as to my own experience relating to that of the secondsighted persons abovementioned i shall here set it down in reference to two of the particulars above written from mr aubreys account viz the second and fifth as in the second particular it is said that those that have the second sight see a multitude of men and women day and night about them so it was with my self for some time for i saw hundreds though i never saw any in the night time without a fire or candlelight or in the moonshine and as the person mentioned in that paragraph had two particular spirits there named which constantly attended him besides others without names so it was with my self two spirits constantly attending me night and day for above three months together who called each other by their names and several spirits would often call at my chamber door and ask whether such spirits lived there calling them by their names and they would answer they did as for the other spirits that attended me i heard none of their names mentioned only i asked one spirit which came for some nights together and rung a little bell in my ear what his name was who answered ariel we find that one of the spirits which attended the second sighted person appeared as a boy the other as a girl but the two that constantly attended my self appeared both in womens habit they being of a brown complexion and about three foot in stature they had both black loose network gowns tied with a black sash about their middles and within the network appeared a gown of a golden color with somewhat of a light striking through it their heads were not dressed with topknots but they had white linen caps on with lace on them about three fingers breadth and over it they had a black loose network hood  as the foresaid second sighted person sitting by the fire with others in the wintertime would see spirits standing by and often seem angry and disturbed though nothing visible to others moved him so as i have been sitting by the fire with others i have seen several spirits and pointed to the places where they were telling the company they were there and one spirit whom i heard calling to me as he stood behind me on a sudden clapped his finger to my side which i sensibly perceived and started at it and as i saw one spirit come in at the door which i did not like i suddenly laid hold of a pair of tongues and struck at him with all my force whereupon he vanished  as in the fifth particular above written he said that the gift of the second sight is very troublesome to those that have it and they would gladly be rid of it so i must declare that i would not for the whole world undergo what i have undergone upon spirits coming twice to me their first coming was most dreadful to me the thing being then altogether new and consequently more surprising though at the first coming they did not appear to me but only called to me at my chamber windows rung bells sung to me and played on music etc but the last coming also carried terror enough for when they came being only five in number the two women before mentioned and three men though afterward there came hundreds they told me they would kill me if i told any person in the house of their being there which put me in some consternation and i made a servant sit up with me four nights in my chamber before a fire it being in the christmas holydays telling no person of their being there one of these spirits in womans dress lay down upon my bed by me every night and told me if i slept the spirits would kill me which kept me waking for three nights in the mean time a near relation of mine went though unknown to me to a physician of my acquaintance desiring him to prescribe me somewhat for sleeping which he did and a sleeping potion was brought me but i set it by being very desirous and inclined enough to sleep without it the fourth night i could hardly forbear sleeping but the spirit lying on the bed by me told me again i should be killed if i slept whereupon i rose and sat by the fire side and in a while returned to my bed and so i did a third time but was still threatened as before whereupon i grew impatient and asked the spirits what they would have told them i had done the part of a christian in humbling my self to god and feared them not and rose from my bed took a cane and knocked at the ceiling of my chamber a near relation of mine lying then over me who presently rose and came down to me about two of the clock in the morning to whom i said you have seen me disturbed these four days past and that i have not slept the occasion of it was that ive spirits which are now in the room with me have threatened to kill me if i told any person of their being here or if i slept but i am not able to forbear sleeping longer and acquaint you with it and now stand in defiance of them and thus i exerted my self about them and notwithstanding their continual threats i slept very well the next night and continued so to do though they continued with me above three months day and night  a gentleman having lately supplied me with another account concerning the second sighted persons which was sent some years since to a lady by a person of whom she had desired it i shall here set down the particulars of it as follows  i he says the more general account given of the second sighted persons is that many highlanders but far more islanders are qualified with this sight that men women and children are indifferently gifted with it some children have it whose parents have it not and some parents have it whose children have it not some adult persons have it who had it not in their youth and cannot tell by what means or cause it was produced in them it is a great trouble to those that have it and they would be rid of it at any rate the sight is of no long duration continuing for the most part but as long as they can keep their eyes steady without twinkling the most assured therefore fix their look that they see the longer but the timorous see only by glances their eyes always trembling at the first sight of the object  ii that which is seen generally by them is the species of living creatures and of inamimate things as ships and the habits upon persons they never see the species of any person already dead what they foresee fails not to exist in the mode and place where it appears to them they cannot well know what space of time shall intervene betwixt the apparition and the real existence but some of the boldest and longest experienced have some rules of conjectures as if they see a man with a shroud in the apparition they will conjecture at the nearness or remoteness of his death by the more or less of his body that  covered with it they will ordinarily see their absent friends though at a great distance sometimes no less than from america to scotland sitting or standing or walking in some certain place and then they conclude with assurance that they shall see them so and there if a man be in love with a woman they ordinarily see that man standing by her and so if a woman be in love they conjecture of their enjoyments by the species touching the person or appearing at a distance from her if they see the species of a person who is sick in any other place in an healthful pasture or action they conclude a recovery but if they are to dye they see them covered with a winding sheet  these generals were verified to persons of honor by such of them as did see and were esteemed honest and sober by all the neighborhood and because there were more of these seers in the isles of lewis harris and vist than elsewere some persons of quality entreated sir james macdonel who is now dead sir norman maclod and mr daniel morison a very honest minister who are still alive to inquire into this sight and to acquaint them therewith which they did and all of them found an agreement in these generals and informed them of many particular and notorious instances confirming what they said  he sets down some remarkable instances which he says were of very knowing and ingenious persons who had made it their business to be well informed concerning the second sight which instances being not printed in any other author that i know of i shall insert them here  the first instance he says is from a person of great learning and eminent quality who gave the following relation  i was once traveling in the highlands with many servants one of them going a little before me and entering into a house where i was to stay all night suddenly stepped back with a screech and a noise and fell by a stone which hit is foot i asked what the matter was for he looked as one very much frighted he told me very seriously i must not lodge in that house i asked why he said he wished so because a dead corpse would very shortly be carried out of it and that several persons carrying of it met him at the door when i heard him cry and therefore he would not have me lodge in so unlucky a place and seeing me laugh and go in he said to the other servants he was very sorry i did so for he was sure what he saw would very shortly come to pass this made me inquire if there were any sick person in the house but there was none the landlord was a strong healthy highlander yet before i went from the house the next day he died of an apoplectick fit  the second instance is from another person who writes thus  in the year      alexander monro who was afterward lieutenant colonel to the earl of dunbartons regiment and my self were walking in a place called ulabill in logh broom in a little plain at the foot of a rugged hill there was a man working with a spade in the walk before us and his face to the hill he did not mind us as we past near him which made me look at him and perceiving him to stare a little strangely i conjectured him to be a seer i called him at which he stared and smiled what are you doing said i he answered me i have seen a very strange thing an army of englishmen leading their horses down that hill and a number of them are come down to the plain and eating the barley which is growing in the field near to the hill this was on the fourth of may for i noted the day and it was four or five days before the barley was sown in the field he spoke of alexander monro asked him how he knew they were englishmen he said because they had on hatts and boots which he knew no scots would have there we as little set by what he said as other foolish visions but in the beginning of august following the earl of middleton then lieutenant for the king in the highlands having occasion to march a party toward the south highlands sent his foot through a place called innerlawel but was forced to send his horse with alexander monro to pass down the very forementioned hill as less rugged though bad enough than that of innerlawel and the foremost party which was first down the hill fell to eating the barley on the little plain under it and monro called to mind what the seer had told us in may before he writ of it and sent an express to me with it  the relator of the third instance writes as follows  i had once an occasion of being in company with a young lady and was told there was a notable seer in the company i called him to speak with me as i did ordinarily when i found any of them and as he had answered me to several questions i asked him if he knew any person to be in love with that lady he said he certainly knew that there was a man in love with her but he did not know the man for in the two days he had been in company with her he perceived one standing near her and his head leaning on her shoulder which he said according to his observations foretold that the man would marry her this was in the year      i desired him to describe the person which he did so that i could conjecture by the description it was such an one of the ladys acquaintance though there were no thought of their marriage till two years after and happening in the year      to find this seer who was an islander in company with the other person whom i conjectured to have been described by him i called him aside and asked him if that were the person he saw by the ladys side two years ago he said it was truly the same and he had seen that lady just then standing by him hand in hand this was some few months before their marriage and the man is since dead and the lady still alive  the fourth instance is thus  in january      says one of great note lieutenant colonel monro and my self happened to be in the house of one william maclod of ferrinlia in rsse the said monro the landlord and my self sitting in three chairs near the fire and in the corner of a great chimney were two islanders who came that very night to the house and were related to the landlord while one of them was talking to monro i perceived the other to look odly toward me from his look and being an islander i conjectured him a seer and asked him what he stard at he answered by desiring me to rise from that chair because it was an unlucky one i asked him why he said there was a dead man in the chair next to me well said i if he be in the chair next me i may keep my own but what kind of man is he he said he was a tall man with a long gray coat having boots on and one of his legs hanging over the arm of the chair and his head hanging down to the other side and his arm backward as if it were broken there were some troops of englishmen then quartered near that place and there being at that time a great frost after a thaw the country was covered all over with ice four or five of the english riding by this house some two days after the vision while we were sitting by the fire we heard a great noise which proved to be these troopers who with the help of other servants were carrying one of their number who had got a very mischievous fall and his arm broken and falling frequently into swooning fits they brought him into the hall and set him in the very chair and in the very posture the seer had described but the man did not die though he recovered with great difficulty  the fifth instance is taken from the account given in by sir norman maclod  there was a gentleman in the isle of harris who was always seen by the seers with an arrow in his thigh those in the isle who thought these prognostications infallible did not doubt but he would be shot in the thigh and die of it sir norman said he always heard it the subject of their discourses for many years when that gentleman was present at last he died without any such accident sir norman was at his burial at st clements church in the isle of harris at the same time another gentleman was brought to be buried in the same church the friends on either side came to a debate who should first enter the church and from words came to blows one who was armed with a bow and arrows let fly amongst them every family in that isle have their burying places in the church in a stone chest and their bodies are carried in open biers to the burial place sir norman having appeased the tumult one of the arrows was found sticking in the dead mans thigh to this sir norman himself was witness mr aubrey in his account of the second sight has a relation much of the same with this though with some variation  the sixth instance is taken from the account which mr daniel morison minister in the isle of lewis gave in  this relation though somewhat of a different nature from the others may be worth notice he tells us of a young woman in his parish who was mightily frighted by seeing her own image still before her when she went into the open air the back of the image being always toward her so that it was not a reflection as in a mirror but the species of such a body as her own and in the very same habit the minister kept her a long while with him but she had no remedy till she was about four or five years elder and then it left her  the gentleman who writ the foregoing relations in a letter to a lady adds in the close of it that in order to solve the phenomenon of the second sight a hint may be taken from this image which appeared to the woman abovementioned and from such another mentioned by aristotle in the fourth book of his metaphysics as also from that common opinion that young infants see apparitions which are not seen by elder eyes and likewise from this that several who have had the second sight when in the highlands or isles upon their being transported to live in other countries especially in america lose this quality as it is reported by gentlemen who knew some of them in barbados that saw no visions there though they were known to have been seers when they lived in the isles of scotland  laurentius ananias printed a book in latin at venice an      concerning the nature of demons l  circa finem where he writes somewhat which seems allied to this gift of the second sight it is thus  some demons so miserably delude some old women and children that they certainly persuaded themselves that on set nights and at set hours their souls being called depart from their bodies and join themselves to the souls of the dead which proceeds but from demons corrupting the imagination of those creatures through infidelity after that manner and as they relate this to credulous old women they predict the deaths of certain persons and if the event sometimes answers they confidently affirm even upon their oath that they were souls from whom they had it when in truth they are nothing but illusions of the devil perverting their fancy which error has possessed the minds of some persons above the vulgar though it hence appears they are all under a delusion for it happened some years since that in a town where some persons were found obnoxious to these affects and illusions of the devil one mark antony who was looked upon as an honest upright person no way given to speak untruths was seized with it and often gave true predictions concerning certain persons especially such as were near their deaths this man being sent for by my brother john antony ananias who is a priest and he coming to him my brother asked him whether what was reported of him were true and he did not deny it whereupon my brother advised him to quit that erroneous opinion telling him that those could not possibly be the souls of the dead but that they were deceitful demons and that he greatly offended god in giving credit to them wherefore he begged him that for gods sake and the welfare of his soul as he perceived that daemonaical seizure coming upon him as he always perceived it beforehand or when he began to be seized with it he would seriously protest against obeying them any longer and that he would earnestly pray to god to free him from that diabolical delusion and madness of mind mark antony being somewhat astonished at what was said to him believed my brother and promised him to follow his advice to the utmost of his power and so went home and when the usual day came that he was obnoxious to those illusions he was not seized with them and was very joyful and gave god thanks for it but upon the next return of the day and hour for he was not wont to be infested with those illusions every day of the week but only tuesdays and thursdays finding his wonted seizure coming upon him and that he was called by those unclean spirits and being greatly afflicted in mind by their signs he cried out with great vehemence that he would no longer follow them upon which outcry almost all the people in the house were awakened and went to him to whom he related all that had past and showed how he was severely beaten by those spirits and from that time he was wholly freed from them for which he gave god great thanks  note in reference to this relation what is written by henry boguet a judge in cases of witchcraft in the country of st claude in burgundy concerning the particular nights on which witches have their sabbaths or meetings in his discourse of witches printed in french at lions   0  chap    he writes as follows  i formerly thought that the sabbath was held only thursday nights because all the witches i have seen have so declared but since that i have read that some of them have confessed they assembled some the night betwixt monday and tuesday some the night betwixt friday and saturday others the night preceding thursday or sunday thence i have concluded that there is no day prefixed for their sabbath but that the witches go to it when the devil requires them i shall add here that antide coals a witch confessed she had been at the sabbath each good day of the year as at christmas easter and the like holidays so far boguet  conformably to the relation of laurentius ananias i have been well informed of a woman in gloucestershire who when any person of the neighborhood was taken ill would generally predict their death or recovery and was much resorted to on that account at length she was seized and had to an assizes at gluster concerning this fact where being asked by the judge how she came by her knowledge as to the death or recovery of persons sick she told him she could give no other account of it but that when any person was sick and she had a mind to know the issue a jury of fairies came to her in the night time who considered of the matter and if afterward they looked cheerful the party would recover if they looked sad he would die nothing else being brought against the woman she was cleared the person from whom i had this information was a justice of peace of that county then on the bench and here i must say that before i heard this relation or had read ananias i saw a jury of fairies or ghosts or what you please to call them summoned and pass a verdict on a person known to me  cardan tells us de rer var l    c    that genii sometimes appear sad before the deaths of persons and gives an instance in julian the emperor who being near clesiphon and studying philosophy saw his genius looking sad whom formerly he had seen in france looking cheerfully and i know not what verses foretelling the death of constantius and consequently his happiness and the horn of amalthaea with which the genius of the republic was wont to be drawn being shut and his chamberlane or steward of his house going from him and so the next day the emperor was killed  baptista fulgosus tells us that sometimes the spirits remain enclosed in humane bodies l   fact and dict memorah c   but their motions are so occult and the senses so bound that we cannot easily know whether those bodies are alive or not hence some are said to be raised from the dead who were never really dead experience having shown they were still living of these persons some relate wonderful things as that they had been where they never were but their spirit being collected in it self comprehends and sees those things which being in its usual state through various distracted thoughts by reason of the corporeal sight it does not know as st austin testifies of one curina who lived in the country of hippo in africa and falling into an ill distemper was looked upon by all men as in a manner dead having lost his senses so that he took no food and having continued in this state for some days his friends would have buried him only they perceived a little breathing at his nostrils but when afterward all persons thought him to be departed on a sudden opening his eyes he desired that some one should be presently sent to curina the blacksmith his neighbor to see how he did and when it was found he was dead at that very hour he affirmed that he was led before a certain judge who vehemently chid those spirits by whom himself was brought before him because he would have curina the blacksmith and not him and for that cause he was restored to life in this ecstasy he said he saw paradise and many other things and among others that he was baptized by st austin at hippo and he was admonished so to be because what then seemed to be done was a vision therefore being restored to his health he had fulfilled what he was admonished  so as bonaysteau tells us the spirit of hermotinus in disc de excel and dig hominis as it seemed leaving his body as dead wandered about various places and afterward related those things which could be known only by those persons which were present to the things themselves herodotus and maximus tyrius write the same of aristaeus  possidonius tells us that a certain rhodian dying nominated six of his equals and said who should die first who next and so on and the event answered the prediction  a vision which happened to the ingenious and learned dr done may not improperly be here inserted mr isaac walton writing the life of the said doctor tells us that the doctor and his wife living with sir robert drury who gave them a free entertainment at his house in drury lane it happened that the lord hay was by king james sent in an ambassy to the french king henry the fourth whom sir robert resolved to accompany and engaged dr done to go with them whose wife was then with child at sir roberts house two days after their arrival at paris dr done was left alone in that room in which sir robert and he and some other friends had dined together to this place sir robert returned within half an hour and as he left so he found dr done alone but in such an ecstasy and so altered in his looks as amazed sir robert to behold him insomuch that he earnestly desired dr done to declare what had befallen him in the short time of his absence to which dr done was not able to make a present answer but after a long and perplexed pause did at last say i have seen a dreadful vision since i saw you i have seen my dear wife pass twice by me through this room with her hair hanging about her shoulders and a dead child in her arms this i have seen since i saw you to which sir robert replied sure sir you have slept since i saw you and this is the result of some melancholy dream which i desire you to forget for you are now awake to which dr donnes reply was i cannot be surer that i now live than that i have not slept since i saw you and am as sure at her second appearing she stopped and looked me in the face and vanished rest and sleep had not altered dr donnes opinion the next day for he then affirmed this vision with a more deliberate and so confirmed a confidence that he inclined sir robert to a faint belief that the vision was true who immediately sent a servant to druyhouse with a charge to hastn back and bring him word whether mrs done were alive and if alive in what condition she was as to her health the twelfth day the messenger returned with this account that he found and left mrs done very sad and sick in bed and that after a long and dangerous labor she had been delivered of a dead child and upon examination the abortion proved to be the same day and about the very hour that dr done affirmed he saw her pass by in his chamber mr walton adds this is a relation which will beget some wonder and well it may for most of our world are at present possessed with an opinion that visions and miracles are ceased and though it is most certain that two lutes being both strung and tuned to an equal pitch and then one played upon the other that is not touched being laid upon a table at a fit distance will like an echo to a trumpet warble a faint audible harmony in answer to the same tune yet many will not believe that there is any such thing as a sympathy with souls etc  an ancient and learned gentleman now living and well known in london has told me that being at a widow gentlewomans house about seven miles from london one day about three of the clock in the afternoon he retired to his chamber where he had not long been but a strange light such as he had never seen before appeared in the room in which light he saw a child of the gentlewoman of the house which had been left sick in london lie dead as also a friend of his own he was much surpised at this and after the thing was over he went down from his chamber to the gentlewoman of the house and as he had been desired to come though next day to the house of a lady who lived in the same parish he desired the foresaid gentlewoman to send word to the lady that he could not wait on her the next day as he had promised for he knew that both the said gentlewoman and himself should be sent for to london and then he told the gentlewoman what had passed and in a while a coach came for them from london accordingly the same gentleman told me that upon his falling into a trance at cambridge he saw also a friend of his dead in london who upon enquiry was found to have died just at the time he saw him  cardan gives a relation somewhat of this nature as follows de rer var l   c    my kinsman baptista cardan studying at pavia on a certain night tried to make a little fire as he rose and in the interim heard a voice say farewell my son i am going to rome and he saw a vast splendour as that of a bundle of straw all on fire being affrighted and throwing by the fireshovel he hid himself under his bedcloaths till his schoolfellows returned from the academy upon their return thinking him to be sick they knocked at his door he opened it and they asking him the cause of his stay there he answered he thought his mother was dead and told them what he had seen and heard and wept withal they turned the thing to a jest some laughing at him some comforting him the day following having heard nothing of his mothers sickness he was certifyed of her death and that she expired at that very hour that he perceived those things the town cardan is distant two and forty miles from pavia that man was not given to lies vain or superstitious and who said he had never seen or heard any preternatural thing till then  a book newly coming to my hands which contains a more particular account in some respects of the second sight in scotland than any i have met with i shall give here some account of it  mr m martin printed the last year in london a book in   o intitld a description of the western isles of scotland called by the ancient geographers hebrides it contains many curious particulars relating to the natural and civil history of those islands with a map of them and in his preface he tells us that perhaps its peculiar to those isles that they have never been described till now by any man that was a native of the country or had traveled them as himself has done and in the conclusion of the said preface he tells us he has given here such an account of the second sight as the nature of the thing will bear and which has always been reckoned sufficient among the unbiased part of mankind but for those that will not be so satisfied they ought to oblige us with a new scheme by which we may judge of matters of fact the chief particulars he has given us concerning the second sight are in a chapter by it self as follows  i in the second sight the vision makes such a lively impression on the seers that they neither see nor think of any thing else but the vision as long as it continues and then they appear pensive or jovial according to the object which was presented to them  ii at the sight of a vision the eyelids of the person are erected and the eyes continue staring till the object vanish as has often been observed by the author and others present  iii there is one in sky an acquaintance of whom observed that when he sees a vision the inner part of his eyelids turns so far upwards that after the object disappears he must draw them down with his fingers and sometimes employs others to draw them down which he finds to be much the easier way  iv the faculty of the second sight does not lineally descend in a family as some imagine for he knows several parents that are endowed with it but not their children and so on the contrary neither is it acquired by any previous compact and after a strict enquiry he could never learn from any among them that this faculty was communicable any way whatsoever  note that this account is differing from the account given before from mr aubrey and i think mr martins reason here against the descent of this faculty from parents to children is not generally conclusive for though he may know parents endowed with it and not children and so on the contrary yet there may be parents who are endowed with it being qualifyed as mr aubrey has said viz both being second sighted whose children may have it by descent and as to this facultys being any other ways communicable since the accounts differ i must leave it to a farther examination  v the seer knows neither the object time nor place of a vision before it appears and the same object is often seen by different persons living at a considerable distance from one another the true way of judging as to the time and circumstance of an object is by observation for several persons of judgment without this faculty are more capable to judge of the design of a vision than a novice that is a seer as an object appears in the day or night it will come to pass sooner or later accordingly  vi if an object be seen early in the morning which is not frequent it will be accomplished in a few hours afterward if at noon it will commonly be accomplished that very day if in the evening perhaps that night if after candles be lighted it will be accomplished that night it is later always in accomplishment by weeks months and sometimes years according to the time of the night the vision is seen  vii when a shroud is perceived about one it is a sure prognostic of death the time is judged according to the height of it about the person for if it be not seen above the middle death is not to be expected for the space of a year and perhaps some months longer and as it is frequently seen to ascend higher toward the head death is concluded to be at hand within a few days if not hours as daily experience confirms examples of this kind were shown the author when the persons of whom the observations were made enjoyed perfect health  there was one instance lately of a prediction in this kind by a seer that was a novice concerning the death of one of the authors acquaintance this was communicated to a few only and with great confidence the author being one of the number did not in the least regard it till the death of the person about the time foretold confirmed to him the certainty of the prediction the foresaid novice is now a skilful seer as appears from many late instances he lives in the parish of st marys the most northern in sky  viii if a woman be seen standing at a mans left hand it is a presage that she will be his wife whether they are married to others or unmarryed at the time of the apparition if two or three women are seen at once standing near a mans left hand she that is next him will undoubtedly be his wife first and so on whether all three or the man be single or married at the time of the vision or not of which there are several late instances of the authors acquaintance it is an ordinary thing for them to see a man that is to come to the house shortly after and if he be not of the seers acquaintance yet he gives such a lively description of his stature complexion habit etc that upon his arrival he answers the character given of him in all respects if the person so appearing be one of the seers acquaintance he can tell by his countenance whether he comes in good or bad humor the author has been seen thus by seers of both sexes at some hundreds of miles distance some that saw him in this manner had never seen him personally and it happened according to their visions without any previous design of his to go to those places his coming there being purely accidental and in the    th page of his book he tells us that mr daniel morison a minister told him that upon his landing in the island rona the natives received him very affectionately and addressed themselves to him with this salutation god save you pilgrim you are heartily welcome here for we have had repeated apparitions of your person among us viz after the manner of the second sight  ix it is ordinary with them to see houses gardens and trees in places void of all three and this in process of time uses to be accomplished of which he gives an instance in the island of sky  x to see a spark of fire fall upon ones arm or breast is a forerunner of a dead child to be seen in the arms of those persons of which there are several fresh instances  to see a seat empty at the time of ones sitting in it is a presage of that persons death quickly after  when a novice or one that has lately obtained the second sight sees a vision in the night time without doors and comes near a fire he presently falls into a swoon  some find themselves as it were in a crowd of people having a corpse which they carry a long with them and after such visions the seers come in sweating and describe the people that appeared if there are any of their acquaintance among them they give an account of their names and also of the bearers but they know nothing concerning the corpse  all those that have the second sight do not always see these visions at once though they are together at the time but if one who has this faculty designedly touch his fellow seer at the instant of a visions appearing then the second sees it as well as the first  xi there is a way of foretelling death by a cry that they call taisk which some call a wrath in the lowland they hear a loud cry without doors exactly resembling the voice of some particular person whose death is foretold by it of which he gives a late instance which happened in the village rigg in sky isle  xii things are also foretold by smelling sometimes as follows fish or flesh is frequently smelt in the fire when at the same time neither of the two are in the house or in any probability like to be had in it for some weeks or months this smell several persons have who are endued with the second sight and its always accomplished soon after  xiii children horses and cows have the second sight as well as men and women advanced in years  that children see it is plain from their crying aloud at the very instant that a corpse or any other vision appears to an ordinary seer of which he gives an instance in a child when himself was present  that horses see it is likewise plain from their violent and sudden starting when the rider or seer in company with them sees a vision of any kind night or day it is observable of an horse that he will not go forward that way till he be led about at some distance from the common road and then he is in a sweat he gives an instance of this in an horse in the isle of sky  that cows have the second sight appears from this that if a woman milking a cow happens to see a vision by the second sight the cow runs away in a great fright at the same time and will not be pacifyed for some time after  in reference to this paracelsus tom   l de art praesaga writes thus horses also have their auguries who perceive by the sight and smell wandering spiris witches and specter and the like things and dogs both see and hear the same things  here in the next place the author answers objections that have lately been made against the reality of the second sight  first it is objected that these seers are visionary and melancholy people who fancy they see things that do not appear to them or any body else  he answers the people of these isles and particularly the seers are very temperate and their diet is simple and moderate in quantity and quality so that their brains are not in all probability disordered by undigested fumes of meat or drink both sexes are free from hysteric fits convulsions and several other distempers of that sort there are no madmen among them nor any instance of self murder it is observed among them that a man drunk never has a vision of the second sight and he that is a visionary would discover himself in other things as well as in that nor are such as have the second sight judged to be visionaries by any of their friends or acquaintance  secondly it is objected that there are none among the learned able to oblige the world with a satisfactory account of these visions therefore they are not to be believed  he answers if every thing for which the learned are not able to give a satisfactory account shall be condemned as false and impossible we shall find many other things generally believed which must be rejected as such  thirdly it is objected that the seers are impostors and the people who believe them are credulous and easily imposed upon  he answers the seers are generally illiterate and well meaning people and altogether void of design nor could he ever learn that any of them made the least gain of it neither is it reputable among them to have that faculty beside the people of the isles are not so credulous as to believe an impossibility before the thing foretold be accomplished but when it actually comes to pass afterward it is not in their power to deny it without offering violence to their senses and reason beside if the seers were deceivers can it be reasonable to imagine that all the islanders who have not the second sight should combine together and offer violence to their understandings and senses to force themselves to believe a lie from age to age there are several persons among them whose birth and education raise them above the suspicion of concurring with an imposter merely to gratify an illiterate and contemptible sort of persons nor can a reasonable man believe that children horses and cows could be engaged in a combination to persuade the world of the reality of the second sight  every vision that is seen comes exactly to pass according to the rules of observation though novices and heedless persons do not always judge by those rules concerning which he gives instances  there are visions seen by several persons in whose days they are not accomplished and this is one of the reasons why some things have been seen that are said never to have come to pass and there are also several visions seen which are not understood till they are accomplished  the second sight is not a late discovery seen by one or two in a corner or a remote isle but its seen by many persons of both sexes in several isles separated about forty or fifty leagues from one another the inhabitants of many of these isles never had the least converse by word or writing and this faculty of seeing visions having continued as we are informed by tradition ever since the plantation of these isles without being disproved by the nicest sceptick after the strictest enquiry seems to be a clear proof of its reality  it is observable that it was much more common twenty years ago than at present for one in ten does not see it now that saw it then  the second sight is not confined to the western isles alone the author having an account that its likewise in several parts of holland but particularly in bommel where a woman has it for which she is courted by some and dreaded by others she sees a smoke about ones face which is a forerunner of the death of a person so seen and she actually foretold the deaths of several that lived there she was living in that town this last winter  the second sight is likewise in the isle of man as appears by this instance captain leaths the chief commander of belfast in his voyage    0 lost thirteen men by a violent storm and upon his landing in the isle of man an ancient man clerk to a parish there told him immediately that he had lost thirteen men the captain enquired how he came to the knowledge of that he answered that it was by thirteen lights which he had seen come into the churchyard as mr sacheverel tells us in his late description of the isle of man note that this is like the sight of the corpscandles in wales which is also well attested  here the author adds many other instances concerning the second sight of which i shall set down only a few  a man in knockow in the parish of st marys the northermost part of sky being in perfect health and sitting with his fellow servants at night was on a sudden taken ill dropped from his seat backward and then fell a vomiting at which the family was much concerned he having never been subject to the like before but he came to himself soon after and had no sort of pain about him one of the family who was accustomed to see the second sight told them that the mans illness proceeded from a very strange cause which was thus an illnatured woman whom he named who lives in the next adjacent village of bornskittag came before him in a very furious and angry manner her countenance full of passion and her mouth full of reproaches and threatened him with her head and hands till he fell over as you have seen him this woman had a fancy for the man but was like to be disappointed as to her marrying of him this instance was told the author by the master of the family and others who were present when it happened  sir norman macklead and some others playing at tables at a game called in irish falmermore wherein there are three of a side and each of them throw the dice by turns there happened to be one difficult point in the disposing of one of the tablemen this obliged the gamester to deliberate before he was to change his man since upon the disposing of it the winning or losing of the game depended at length the butler who stood behind advised the player where to place his man with which he complied and won the game this being thought extraordinary and sir norman hearing one whisper him in the ear asked who advised him so skilfully he answered it was the butler but this seemed more strange for he could not play at tables upon this sir norman asked him how long it was since he had learnt to play and the fellow owned that he had never played in his life but that he saw the spirit brownie a spirit usually seen in that country reaching his arm over the players head and touching the part with his finger on the point where the tableman was to be placed this was told the author by sir norman and others who happened to be present at the time  daniel bow alias black an inhabitant of bornskittag who is one of the precisest seers in the isles foretold the death of a young woman in minginis within less than    hours before the time and accordingly she died suddenly in the fields though at the time of the prediction she was in perfect health but the shroud appearing close about her head was the ground of his confidence that her death was at hand  the same person foretold the death of a child in his masters arms by seeing a spark of fire fall on his left arm and this was likewise accomplished soon after the prediction  some of the inhabitants of harries sailing round the isle of sky with a design to go to the opposite mainland were strangely surprised with an apparition of two men hanging down by the ropes that secured the mast but could not conjecture what it meant they pursued their voyage but the wind turning contrary they were forced into broadford in the isle of sky where they found sir donald mac donald keeping a sheriffs court and two criminals receiving sentence of death there the ropes and mast of that very boat were made use of to hang those criminals this was told the author by several who had this instance related them by the boats crew  several persons living in a certain family told the author that they had frequently seen two men standing at a gentlewomans left hand who was their masters daughter they told the mens names and being her equals it was not doubted but she would be married to one of them and perhaps to the other after the death of the first sometime after a third man appeared who seemed always to stand nearest to her of the three but the seers did not know him though they could describe him exactly and within some months after this man who was seen last actually came to the house and fully answered the description given of him by those who never saw him but in a vision and he married the woman shortly after they live in the isle of sky and both themselves and others confirmed the truth of this instance when the author saw them  archibald mac donald of the parish of st marys in the isle of sky being reputed famous for his skill in foretelling things to come by the second sight happening to be in the village knockow one night and before supper told the family that he had just then seen the strangest thing he ever saw in his life viz a man with an ugly long cap always shaking his head but that the strangest of all was a little kind of an harp which he had with four strings only and that it had two harts horns fixed in the front of it all that heard this odd vision sell a laughing at archibald telling him that he was dreaming or had not his wits about him since he pretended to see a thing which had no being and was not so much as heard of in any part of the world all this could not alter archibalds opinion who told them that they must excuse him if he laughed at them after the accomplishment of the vision archibald returned to his own house and within three or four days after a man with a cap harp etc came to the house and the harp strings horns and cap answered the description of them at first view and he shook his head when he played for he had two bells fixed to his cap this harper was a poor man who made himself a buffoon for his bread and was never seen before in those parts and at the time of the prediction he was in the isle of barray which is about twenty leagues distant from that part of sky this relation is vouched by mr daniel martin and all his family and such as were then present and live in the village where this happened  one daniel nicholson minister of st marys in sky the parish in which mr archibald mac donald lived told the author that one sunday after sermon at the chapel uge he took an occasion to inquire of archibald if he still retained that unhappy faculty of seeing the second sight and wished him to get rid of it if possible for said he it is no true character of a good man archibald was highly displeased and answered that he hoped h was no more unhappy than his neighbors for seeing what they could not perceive i had said he as serious toughts as my neighbors in time of hearing a sermon to day and even then i saw a corpse laid on the ground close to the pulpit and i assure you it will be accomplished shortly for it was in the day time there were none in the parish then sick and few are buried at that little chapel nay sometimes not one in a year yet when mr nicholson returned to preach in the said chapel a fortnight or three weeks after he found one buried in the very spot named by archibald this story is vouched by mr nicholson and several of the parishioners still living  note that it is an argument of somewhat evil attending this faculty of the second sight because there are instances given of some persons who have been freed of it upon using some christian practices  sir norman mac lead who has his residence in the isle of bernera which lies between the isles of n vist and harries went to the isle of sky about business without appointing any time for his return his servants in his absence being all together in the large hall at night one of them who had the second sight told the rest they must remove for there would be abundance of other company in the hall that night one of his fellow servants answered that there was very little likelihood of that because of the darkness of the night and the danger of coming through the rocks that lie round the isle but within an hour after one of sir normans men came to the house bidding them provide lights etc for his master had newly landed  sir norman being told of this called for the seer and examined him about it he answered that he had seen the spirit brownie in humane shape come several times and make a show of carrying an old woman that sat by the fire to the door and at last seemed to carry her out by neck and heels which made him laugh heartily and gave occasion to the rest to conclude him mad to laugh so much without any reason this instance was told the author by sir norman himself  four men from the isle of sky and harries went to barbados and stayed there some years who though they had wont to see the second sight in their native country never saw it in barbados but upon their return to england the first night after their landing they saw the second sight as the author was told by several of their acquaintance  john morison who lives in bernera of harries wears the plant called fuga daemonum sewed in the neck of his coat to prevent his seeing of visions and says he never saw any since he first carried that plant about him  a spirit by the country people called brownie was frequently seen in all the most considerable families in the isles and north of scotland in the shape of a tall man having very long brown hair but within these  0 years past he has been seen but rarely  there were spirits also that appeared in the shape of women horses swine cats and some like fiery balls which would follow men in the fields but there have been but few instances of these for  0 years past  these spirits used also to form sounds in the air resembling those of an harp pipes the crowing of a cock and of the grinding of hand mills and sometimes voices have been heard in the air at night singing irish songs the words of which songs some of the authors acquaintance still retain one of them resembled the voice of a woman who died some time before and the song related to her state in the other world these accounts the author says he had from persons of as great integrity as any are in the world so far mr martin  as for sounds in the air resembling that of musical instruments crowings of a cock singing etc i have often heard them my self  in my reading i have met with many well attested instances which may strongly induce a belief of what is said concerning the second sight of which instances i shall here give a few  sicillus an herald to alphonsus king of aragon in his book entitled le blason des couleurs writes thus there is a town in italy called teridon where this miracle is wont to happen if any citizen or labourer be to die that year when he labors his field there clearly appears a great effusion of blood and the blood signifies a near ensuing death of the possessor of that field  the lord henry howard in the book he writ against supposed prophesies chap   writes thus  it chanced after the decease of a certain honest gent whom i forbear to name in some respects the devil appearing  so he expresses it first to one of his daughters in his wonted shape and with a voice and countenance answerable and so again to another he brought the young woman into so strange a condition that it would have grieved any man to have seen them and this seemed strange withal that at the time his appearance haunted them they could as well tell who came into the house what they said and did etc as any that were present in their companies the like story for all the world is written of hieronymo an italian and likewise of one of the greek emperors so far the lord howard who i think may be looked upon as an unexceptionable testimony in the story he relates of his own knowledge he having otherwise little faith in things of this kind  the learned camerarius writes thus hor sub cis cent   c  0 i could easily name and show a man living in my neighborhood while i write this who formerly having been famous for his mannagement of serious affairs as well as other ways has now for many years been kept under a guard because now and then for certain intervals of time he is acted by a wonderful and troublesome spirit for he does not only when in a sedate mind call many that come to him though strangers and such as he had never seen before by their proper names and talk to them pleasantly concerning their parents relations and the coats of arms of their families and this as familiarly as though he had been a long time conversant with them and which he did to my self and if he be in a troubled state mixes false and obscene things with what he says but also sometimes he speaks and does other unusual and strange things particularly it was observed that some years since about that very time that cispar castalion admiral of france with his son in law and many noblemen of his religion were by surprise killed in their beds at paris he had wonderful visions from which it might have been gathered that some cruel enterprise was somewhere contrived and executed among other things the very night of that cruel butchery made at paris he often cried out all is in blood and a little after see see what great troops of devils do i see wandering in the air on every side coming from several remote parts congratulating each other and skipping for joy as though they had executed some strange and cruel enterprise long desired by them but he added crying out that all those things were acted out of germany  i think this a great instance from a learned man and if any men can satisfy themselves with aristotle to solve facts of this nature by saying they are operations of melancholy i leave them to their fancies if this fact and others set down before by me may be received as a truth i see not what difficulty there may be in admitting for a truth what is reported of apollonius tyanaeus viz that as he was disputing in an open auditory at ephesus he cried out on a sudden that he saw domitian stabbed at rome at the very time that it was done  to give one instance nearer home there lived not many years since a very aged gentlewoman in london in waterlane by fleet street whose name was pight who was endowed with a prophetic spirit she was very well known to many persons of my acquaintance now living in london among others a gentleman whose candor i can no way suspect has told me that he often resorted to her as to an oracle and that as soon as he came into her presence she would usually tell him that she knew he was coming for that she had seen his spirit for some time before and without his saying any thing to her she would commonly tell him what the business was which he came to consult her about and what the event of it would be which he always found to fall out as she said and many other persons now living can testify the like experience of her as to themselves  joan marcus marci part   p    in his philos vet restituta tell us of a boy seized with the plague at rome who being thought dead on a sudden came to himself and calling his master told him he had really been in heaven and there had understood how many and who were to die out the house and naming them he affirmed his mastar should survive and to create a belief of what he said he showed that he had learned all languages and presently thereupon spoke in greek with his master he made a trial also in other tongues by conversing with those who were skilled in them whereas before he had only learned the roman language and when he had lived thus three days falling into a rage he laid hold of his hands with his teeth and really died and the others whom he had named died his master remaining alive  to the foregoing account of the second sighted persons in scotland i shall subjoin a thing no less strange viz an account of the specrsighted persons in new england so called because upon their being seized with strange fits as of weeping laughing roaring convulsions violent agitations etc they were wont to see the specter of those persons who they said tormented them  mr cotton mather a minister of new england in his relation of the wonders of the invisible world inserted in his ecclesiasticl history of that country printed in london an   0  in fol has given us several instances of this kind as also of many other diabolical operations and mr robert calef a merchent of boston in new england has given us a pretty full account of the same in his book intitld more wonders of the invisible world or the wonders of the invisible world displayed in five parts printed in london an   00 in   o and whereas these two authors seem to differ in opinion the former thinking things to have been real and proceeding from the operations of evil spirits and the later looking upon them gnerally to have been illusion and imposture i shall give here an abstract of both for men to see what they may rationally judge in the matter  mr mather in the sixth book of the said history chap   relates many of these facts and that with all sincerity as he declares and says that no rational man of all that country ever questioned them  his first instance is of one anne cole a person of serious piety as he writes living in the house of her godly father at hartford in new england who an      was taken with strange its so that she would express strange things unknown to her self her tongue being guided by a demon the general purport of her discourse was that such and such persons whom she named were consting how they might carry on mischievous designs against her and several others by afflicting their bodies or destroying their good names one of the persons mentioned by her was named greensmith who was then in prison on suspicion of witchcraft and was brought before the magistrates to whom the ministers who had taken notes of what anne cole had said reading what they had written she with astonishment confessed that the things were so and that her self with other persons named in the paper had familiarity with the devil who told her that at christmas they would have a merry meeting when the agreement betwixt them should be subscribed she declared that her devil appeared to her first in the shape of a deer skipping about her and at length in that shape talked to her and that the devil had frequently carnal knowledge of her on this confession with other concurring evidences the woman was executed and other persons accused made their escape whereupon anne cole was delivered of her extraordinary vexations  the second instance is elizabeth knap who in october      was taken after a very strange manner weeping laughing roaring with violent agitations etc and had a demon speaking in her among other things she cried out in her fits that a certain woman in the neighborhood appeared unto her and was the only cause of her affliction the woman thus cried out on was a very virtuous person who by the advice of her friends visited the afflicted who though she were in her its and had her eyes wholly shut yet when the innocent woman was coming in she showed her self wonderful sensible of it and was in great agonies at her approach but the innocent woman prayed earnestly with and for this possessed creature whereupon as she came to her self she confessed she had been deluded by satan who in the shape of diverse persons cruelly tormented her after diverse manners and then told her it was not himself but they were her tormentors  the third instance is of the house of mr william morse of newbury which an      was infested with demons not unlike the demon of tedworth bricks sticks stones pieces of wood etc were often thrown at the house a long staff danced up and down the chimny and afterward was hung on a line and swung to and fro an iron crook was violently hurryed about by an invisible hand and a chair flew about the room till at last it light on the table where meat stood ready to be eaten and was like to have spoiled all a chest was by an invisible hand carried from one place to another and the doors barricadod and the keys of the family taken some of them from the bunch where they were tied and the rest flying about with aloud noise of their knocking against one another and many other unaccountable things of this kind passed too long for me here to set down a little boy belonging to the family was a principal sufferer in these molestations he was flung about at such a rate that they feared his brains would have been beaten out nor did they find it possible to hold him his bed clothes were pulled off from his bed his bed shaken a man took him to keep him in a chair but the chair fell a dancing and both were very near being thrown into the fire he was pricked on the back they found an iron spindle and pins stuck in him all the knives in the house were one after another stuck in his back which the spectators pulled out sometimes he barked like a dog then clockd like an hen he complained that a man called p  l appeared to him as the cause of all before the devil put an end to these tricks the invisible hand which did all these things put on an astonishing visibility they often thought they felt the hand that scratched them while yet they saw it not but when they thought they had hold of it it would give them the slip once the fist beating the man was discernable but they could not catch hold of it at length an apparition of a blackamoor child showed it self plainly to them another time a drumming on the board was heard which was followed with a voice that sang revenge revenge sweet is revenge at this the people being terrifyed called upon god whereupon there followed a mournful voice uttering these expressions alas alas we knock no more we knock no more and there was an end of all  the fourth instance is of the house of nicolas desborough at hartford which an      was troubled much after the same manner it began upon a controversy happening betwixt the man of the house and another person concerning a chest of clothes which the man apprehended the other unjustly detained from him and it lasted diverse months till upon restoring the clothes the trouble ceased he adds at brighling in sussex in england there happened a tragedy not unlike to this an      it is recorded by clarke in the second volume of his examples  his fifth and sixth instances are relations of the same nature  his seventh instance is of one mr philip smith aged about fifty years a deacon of the church of hadley a member of the general court a justice of the county court a lieutenant of a troop and a man very exemplary for devotion sanctity and gravity who an      was miserably murdered by witchcraft he was by his office concerned about relieving the indigences of a wretched woman in the town who being dissatisfied with him expressed her self in a threatening manner so that he apprehended receiving mischief at her hands he fell ill of a wearing distemper and at length became delirious and cried out not only of pains but also of pins tormenting him in several parts of his body in his affliction he exclaimed much on the said woman and others as being seen by him in the room some young men in the town went and gave disturbance to the woman so complained of and all the while they were disturbing her he was at ease and slept as a weary man gallipots of medicines prepared for him were unaccountably emptyed audible screechings were made about the bed when his hands and feet lay wholly still and were held by others mr smith at length dies the jury that viewed his corpse found a swelling on one breast his privities wounded or burnt his back full of bruises and several holes that seemed made with awles diverse noises were heard in the room where the corpse lay as the clattering of chairs and stools whereof no account could be given  his ninth instance to the facts of which the author was himself a witness is of four children of john goodwin of boston all religiously educated these children an      were wrought on by witchcraft by an old woman whom the eldest daughter who was about thirteen years of age had provoked so that she was immediately seized with odd fits in a short time after one of her sisters and two brothers were horribly seized with the same all the children were tormented still just in the same part of the bodies at the same time though their pains flew like lightning from one part to another and they were kept so far asunder that they neither saw nor heard one another complaints at nine or ten of the clock at night they still had a release from their miseries and slept all night pretty well but when the day came they were again miserably handled sometimes they were deaf sometimes dumb sometimes blind and often all three at once and many other unaccountable symptoms attended them they made most pitious outcries that they were cut with knives and struck with blows and the plain prints of the wounds were seen upon them the suspected womans house being searched several images or puppets or babies made of rags and stuffed with goats hair were there found and the woman confessed that the way to torment the objects of her malice was by wetting of her finger with her spittle and stroaking those little images the abused children were then present in the court and one of the images being brought to the woman she started up and snatched it into her hand when presently upon it one of the children fell into sad fits before the whole assembly the judges caused a repetition of the experiment and still found the same effect of it though the children saw not when the hand of the witch was laid upon the images to make all things clear the court appointed five or six physicians to examine her very strictly whether she were no way crazed in her understanding who after spending several hours with her returned her compos mentis and sentence of death was passed on her after her condemnation mr mather says he visited her several times and she then told him she used to be at meetings where her prince and four more were present she told him who the four were and plainly said that her prince was the devil at her execution she said the afflicted children should not be relieved by her death for others besides her self had a hand in their affliction and accordingly the children continued afflicted far worse than before one of the children discerned the specter and told the names of those that tormented them a blow struck at the place where he saw the spectre was always felt by the boy himself in that part of his body which answered to that was struck at and this though his back were turned and the thing so done that there could be no collusion in it yet after the agonies were over to which a push or a stab at the spectre had put him to as in a minute or two they would be he would have a respite from his ails a considerable while and the spectre would be gone the affliction of the children went on till they barked at each other like dogs and then purrd like cats they would complain they were in a red hot oven and sweated and panted as if they had been really so then they would say that cold water was thrown on them at which they would shiver very much they would complain of being roasted on an invisible spit and lie and roll and groan as if it had been so and by and by screech out that knives were cutting them they would complain that their heads were nailed to the floor and it was beyond an ordinary strength to pull them from thence mr mather says the demons did not know our thoughts for if himself or others used a jargon and said untie its neckcloth but the party bidden understood their meaning to be untie his shoe the neckcloth and not the shoe has been by wrythen postures rendered strangely unaccessible no good thing could then be endured near those children who while they were themselves loved every good thing the eldest girl being at mr mathers house a chain invisible to any but her self would be clapped about her and she in much pain and fear would cry out when they began to put it on sometimes persons present could with their hands knock it off as it began to be fastnd but ordinarily when it was on she would be pulled out of her seat with much violence toward the fire that it was as much as one or to two could do to keep her out if persons present stamped on the hearth just between her and the fire she screamd out that by jarring the chain they hurt her an unseen rope with a cruel noose was put about her neck whereby she was choked till she was black in the face and though it were got off before it had killed her yet there were the red marks of it and of a finger and a thumb near it remaining to be seen for some while afterward these children were often near burning and drowning and strangling themselves with their neckcloths but still seasonably succord and to omit many other circumstances they were at length delivered from this great affliction  mr mather at the end of fourteen instances of this kind written by himself lays before us an account of visitations of the same nature which happened in new england an      and written by mr john hles a person who as mr mather says would not for a world be guilty of overdoing the truth in an history of such importance the account is as follows  at the latter end of the year      mr paris pastor of the church in salem village had a daughter of about nine years of age and a niece of about eleven sadly afflicted with unaccountable distempers as physicians that were consulted thought and one of them judged they were betwitchd mr paris had an indian man servant and his wife an indian woman who confessed that without the knowledge of their master and mistress they had taken some of the afflicted persons urine and mixing it with meal had made a cake and baked it to find out the witch as they said after this the afflicted persons cried out of the indian woman named tituba that she pinched pricked and grievously tormented them and they saw her here and there where no body else could and could tell where she was and what she did when she was absent from them these children were bitten and pinched by invisible agents their limbs were racked and tormented and miserably contorted etc tituba was examined who confessed the making of that cake and said her mistress in her own country was a witch and had taught her some means to be used for the discovery of a witch and for preventing of being bewitched in a short time other persons who were of age to be witnesses were molested by satan and in their fits cried out upon tituba and goody orburn and sarah good that they or specter in their shapes did grievously torment them the justices at salem examined the afflicted and accused together and upon the examination tituba confessed that she was a witch and that she and the other two accused did torment and bewitch the complainers and that these with two others whose names she knew not had their witchmeetings together relating the times when and places where they met with other circumstances upon this tituba osburn and good were committed to prison on suspicion of acting witchcraft soon after these afflicted persons complained of others afflicting them in their fits and the number of the afflicted and accused began to increase and upon examination more confessed themselves guilty of the crimes they were suspected of the number of confessors amounting at length to fifty the justices judges and others concerned used all conscientious endeavors to do what was right according to former presidents in england in the like cases the matter was carried on chiefly by the complaints and accusations of the afflicted and by the confessions of the accused condemning themselves and others yet experience showed that the more were apprehended the more were still afflicted and the number of the confessors increasing did but increase the number of the accused and the executing of some made way for the apprehending of others for still the afflicted complained of being tormented by new objects as the former were removed so that those that were concerned were amazed at the number and quality of the persons accused and feared innocent persons suffered and henceforth the juries generally acquitted such as were tried fearing they had gone too far before and all were set at liberty even the confessors the number of the accused was increased to above an hundred and many of them were persons of blameless and holy lives nineteen were executed and all denied the crime dying and some of them were knowing persons and had before this been accounted blameless livers the persecution ceasing the afflicted grew presently well the accused were quiet and for five years past there has been no molestation by them so in suffolk in england about the year      there was such a prosecution till they saw that unless a stop were put to it it would bring all into blood and confusion the like has been in france till  00 were put to death and in some other places the like so that new england is not the only place circumvented by the wiles of satan in this kind he relates from wierus p     that an inquisitor in the subalpine valleys inquired after women witches and burnt above an hundred and was prosecuting more till the country people rose and by force of arms hindered them and referred the matter to the bishop their husbands affirmed that at that very time it was said of them that they played and danced under a tree they were in bed with them  at chelmsford in essex an      there were    at once before judge coniers and fourteen of them hanged and an hundred more detained in several prisons in suffolk and essex  as for the case at salem he conceives it proceeded from some mistaken principles as that satan cannot assume the shape of an innocent person and in that shape do mischief to the bodies and goods of mankind and that when the devil does harm to persons in their bodies or goods its at least for the most part by the help of our neighbors some which are in covenant with him this is the substance of what mr hales delivers and mr mather tells us that mr hales from whose manuscript he transcribed this does there confute these mistaken principles yet spends whole chapters to prove that there is a witch whom he thus defines it is a person that having the free use of his reason does knowingly and wittingly obtain of the devil or of any other divine power but the true god an ability to do or know strange things or things which he cannot by his own humane abilities arrive unto  mr mather in an appendix at the end of his sixth chapter of his sixth book beforementioned gives a short relation of some practices of witchcraft used by the indians of new england as follows  the indians of marthas vineyard who are now christians abundance of them acknowledge the witchcraft wherein they had actual conversations and explicit confederacies with devils while they were pagons they know that many persons among them have been by the zeal of their parents dedicated to their infernal gods and educated for their especial service but that the demons accept only of some here and there to make pawaws or wizards of they know that these pawaws often employ their demons to smite their neighbors with blindness and lameness and other mischiefs and sometimes to kill them and sometimes to cure their maladies they know that their manner is to form a piece of leather like an arrows head and then tie an hair to it or to take a bone of some dead creature over these things they use magical ceremonies whereupon the demon presently snatches them away and conveys them into the bodies of persons to be afflicted or sometime the demon pretends to them that he brings a portion of the spirit of the person closely imprisoned in a fly and as they deal with the fly so it fares with the body of the person intended some of the pawaws faculty chiefly consists in discovering and recovering stolen goods by the help of their demons a pawaw turned christian said he had often employed his god who appeared to him still in the form of a snake to kill wound and lame such as he designed mischief to so far mr mather  i shall now give an account of what mr calef above mentioned has delivered in his book entitled more wonders of the invisible world etc  in his preface he tells the reader he publishes these his collections and sentiments in hopes that having well considered and compared them with the scriptures he will see reason as well as himself to question a belief so prevalent as that there treated of as also the practice flowing from thence he declares his disbelief of the operations and effects of the devil expressed by mr mather in his wonders of the invisible world as that the devil exhibited himself ordinarily as a black man and decoyed miserable malicious creatures o list themselves in his service by entering their names in a book and that they have had their meetings and sacraments having each of them their specter or devils commissioned by them and representing of them to be the engines of their malice by these wicked specter afflicting poor people with various torments even killing some and causing some to destroy themselves and carrying some over trees and hills miles together many of them being tempted to sign the devils laws  he takes this matter to be as others understand it viz that the devil has been too hard for many in new england by his temptatio signs and lying wonders with the help of pernicious notions formerly imbibed and poest together with the accusations of a  of possessed distracted or lying wenches accusing their innocent neighbors  they see their specter that is the  their likeness afflicting of them whereu many tragedies followed which though  one parish spread over the whole counry and he thinks a zeal led by blindness and passion and former presidents had herein precipitated persons into these wickednesses or witchcrafts and says much the same has been acted this present year in scotland  his book being divided into five parts he begins his first part with a letter sent by mr cotton mather to a friend of his containing a relation of an apparition happening to one margaret rule living in the north part of boston this young woman on a sunday december the  0 th      after some hours of previous disturbance in the public assembly fell into odd fits which caused her friends to carry her home where her fits in a few hours appeared to be preternatural she was assaulted by eight cruel specter of which she thought she knew three or four but the rest came still with their faces covered she privately told mr mather the names of those she knew who says they were miserable wretches that for many years had been strongly suspected for witches those specter brought her a red thick book not very broad about a cubit long and demanded her to set her hand to it or at least to touch it with her hand as a sign of her becoming the devils servant which she peremptorily refusing to do they fell a tormenting her cruelly so that she was forced to keep her bed six weeks together sometimes though not always together with the specter there looked in upon her as she said a short black man whom they called their master being eaxctly of the same dimensions complexion and voice with the devil that has exhibited himself to other infested people not only in other parts of new england but also in other countries of europe as relations from thence inform us she was cruelly pinched with invisible hands very often in a day and the black and blue marks of the pinches became immediately vivisible to the standers by she would also be miserably hurt with pins that were found stuck in her neck back and arms though those wounds made by the pins would in a few minutes ordinarily be cured she would also be strangely distorted in her joints by exorbitant convulsions to pass by other strange relations of her in which mr mather thinks there could be no imposture once in the middle of the night she lamented sadly that the specter threatened the drowning of a young man in the neighborhood whom she named to the company and it was found that at that very time this young man having been pressed on board a man of war then in the harbor was attempting to swim on shore and had been drowned in the attempt if a boat had not seasonably took him up there were wonderful noises every now and then made about the room where she lay which the persons present could ascribe to no other actors but the specter once her tormentors pulled her up to the ceiling of her chamber and held her there before a very numerous company of spectators who found it as much as they could all do to pull her down again she had also a white spirit which came to her whose bright shining and glorious garments she had a frequent view of he stood by her bed continually heartning and comforting of her and counseling her to maintain her faith and hope in god and never to comply with the temptations of her adversaries mr mather says he has seen it fulfilled more than three times in the deliverance of enchanted and possessed persons whom god has cast in his way that their deliverance could not be obtained before the third fast kept for them and the third day still obtained the deliverance and after margaret rule had been more than five weeks in her miseries the white spirit said to her well this day such a man whom he named has kept a third day for your deliverance now be of good cheer you shall speedily be delivered mr mather inquired whether what had been said of that man were true and was certainly informed that it was precisely so on the last day of the week her tormentors as she said approaching toward her would be forced still to recoil and retire as unaccountably unable to meddle with her and they would retire to the fire side with their puppets but going to stick pins in those puppets they could not make the pins to enter and she saw their black master to strike them and kick them to make them do their work and renew the marks of his vengeance on them when they failed of doing it at last being as it were tired with their ineffectual attempts to mortify her they furiously said well thou shall not be the last and after a pause they added go and the devil go with you we can do no more whereupon they flew out of the room and she returning perfectly to her self gave thanks to god for her deliverance her tormentors left her extreme weak and aint and overwhelmed with vapors which would not only cause her sometimes to fall in a swoon but likewise now and then for a little while discompose her reason though her former troubles returned not  to this relation mr mther adds he has always been of this opinion that we are ignorant of what powers the devils may have to do their mischiefs in the shapes of some that had never been explicitly engaged in diabolical confederacies and that therefore though many witchcrafts had been fairly detected on enquiries provoked and begun by spectre apparitions yet himself has been so far for abating the excessive credit of specter accusations that he still charged the afflicted committed to his care that they should cry out on no body for afflicting them though if it might be of any advantage to them they might tell their minds to some one person of discretion enough to make no ill use of it nor had the civil authority prosecuted those things had not a conscientious regard to the cries of miserable families overcome the reluctancies of the judges to meddle with them  the second part of this book begins with a narrative of what past at two visits given by mr cotton mather and his father to margaret rule written by mr calef as he says from the mouths of some persons who were then present of which narrative mr cotton mather greatly complains as very unfairly and falsely representing things in referenee to his father and himself  it contains also letters from mr calef to mr cotton mather offering a meeting with him and desiring an information in some doctrinals relating to witchcraft which meeting mr mather declined at the place nominated by mr calef though he offered to discourse with him concerning it in his study or any other convenient place there are also papers attested by several hands of persons present that margaret rule was lifted up to the ceiling of the room where she lay by an invisible hand and that several of the persons present had much ado with all their strength to pull her down this is followed by another letter from mr calef to mr mather in which notwithstanding the attestations of the persons present he declares his disbelief of margaret rules being so lifted up his reason is that then miracles are not ceased this seeming to him as true a miracle as for iron to swim and that the devil can work such miracles  next follows several letters from mr calef to mr mather and others relating to the doctrinals of witchcraft both desiring mr mather to explain it and setting forth what himself conceives of it according to the scriptures and having inserted a letter which he writ to the ministers whether english french or dutch in new england he concludes it thus that the only decisive circumstance to convict a witch as far as he can find in the scriptures is a maligning and oppugning the word work or worship of god and by any extraordinary sign seeking to seduce any from it though not excluding any other branch when as well proved by that infallible rule and that the going to the afflicted or possessed to divine who are witches by their spectresight is a great wickedness and that the searching for tets the experiment of their saying the lords prayer the falling at the sight and rising at the touch of the supposed criminal being all of them foreign from scripture as well as reason are abominations to be abhorred and repented of lastly that their salem witchcraft either respecting the judges and juries and their tenderness of life or the multitude and pertinency of witnesses both afflicted and confessors or the integrity of historians are as authentic and made as certain as any ever of that kind in the world have been and yet every one now sees through it and that it was the abovementioned sentiments that procured this saddest affliction and most lasting infamy that ever befell that country mr calefs next letter is to mr samuel willard a member of harward college in new england where among other things he says that by the late prosecution under the notion of witches twenty suffered as evil doers besides those that died in prison above ten more condemned and an hundred imprisoned and about  00 more accused and the country generally in fears when it would come to their turn to be accused that those very accusers which had been imprisoned as witnesses against so many accused at length those in most high esteem both magistrates and ministers as guilty of witchcraft which showed their rulers that necessity lay upon them to confound what had so long confounded the country as being unwilling to run the same risque  mr mather having sent mr calef a book printed by mr baxter entitled the certainty of the world of spirits for his instruction in that kind mr calef has here inserted a letter which he sent to mr mather containing animadversions on that book and in another letter which he writ to the ministers in and near boston he speaks of the doctrine of the manicheans and endavours to show that the present age is not free from that infection and ascribes the deluge of bloodshed among christians to this that men having taken up a belief of a covenanting afflicting and killing witch and finding no footsteps of such a witch in the scriptures have concluded that though the scriptures be full in it that a witch should not live yet that it has not at all described the crime nor means whereby the culpable might be detected and hence they account it necessary to make use of those diabolical and bloody ways always heretofore practiced for their discovery finding that the rules given to detect other crimes are wholly useless for the discovery of such  mr calefs last letter of his second part is to mr benjamin wadsworth a minister whom he seems to charge with not well explaining the scriptures in reference to witchcraft and says the late dangerous notion that the devil appears to persons and that they and the devil make mutual engagements confirmed by signing the devils book and are from hence enabled not only to know futurities and things done at a distance but are also empowered thereby to do harm to neighbors to raise storms and do things above and against the course of nature has been the occasion of shedding so much blood in the world he adds it is manifest that the belief of the witches power to do the things abovementioned was an ancient belief of the heathens and that from them it was received by the papists who have since improved upon it and brought in the notion of a covenant and that protestants seem to have lately improved it farther by saying that witches can commissionate devils to do those mischiefs thereby setting the witch in the place of god he has writ also in a precedent letter that two parties in dispute were not agreed which to put it upon whether the devil impowers the witch or the witch commissions him on the contract but both parties are agreed in this that one way or other the mischief is effected and so the criminal becomes guilty of death in the search after which criminals many countries have fallen into such convulsions that neither the devastation made by a conquering enemy nor the plague it self has been so formidable  the third part of this book gives an account of the differences happening at salem village on the account of prosecutions for witchcraft which began there where one mr paris was pastor who notwithstanding his acknowledging some errors he might have fallen into in that respect was at last dismissed from that cure in his acknowledgment under his hand he owns that the horrid calamity of afflicting that country broke out first in his house and that in his family there were some of both parties viz accusers and accused  the fourth part contains an ingenious letter writ by a gentleman without a name endeavoring to prove the commonly received opinion about witchcraft to which mr calef has written a reply and a second letter is written by the foresaid gentleman to which mr calef has a rejoinder  the fifth part contains an account of the most memorable matters of fact touching the supposed witchcraft in new england now though mr calefs account of facts contains many more particulars than what i have set down before from mr hals yet since they would be too tedious for me to insert here i shall only note some odd passages in them  he tells us that about the end of the year      a new scene relating to witchcraft was begun one joseph ballard at andover whose wife was ill and after died of a fever sent to salem for some of those accusers to tell him who afflicted his wife others did the same and horse and man were sent from several places to fetch those accusers who had the spectre sight that they might thereby tell who afflicted those that were any way ill when these came into any place where such were usually they fell into a fit after which being asked who it was that afflicted the person they would for the most part name one whom they said sat on the head and another that sat on the lower parts of the afflicted soon after ballards sending more than fifty of the people of andover were complained of for afflicting their neighbors here it was that many accused themselves of riding upon poles through the air many parents believing their children to be witches and many husbands their wives etc when these accusers came to the house of any person upon such an account it was ordinary for other young people to be taken with fits and to have the same spectre sight mr dudley bradstreet a justice of peace in andover having granted out warrants and committed thirty or forty persons to prisons for the supposed witchcrafts at length saw cause to forbear granting out any more warrants soon after which he and his wife were cried out of himself was by them said to have killed nine persons by witchcraft and found it his safest course to make his escape  a dog being afflicted at salem village and those that had the spectre sight being sent for they accused mr john bradstreet brother to the justice that he afflicted the said dog and now rid upon him he made his escape into petattequa government and the dog was put to death and was all of the afflicted that suffered death  at andover they complained of a dog as afflicting of them and would fall into their fits at the dogs looking on them the dog was put to death  note in reference to this that in my precedent account of the second sight children horses and cows had it as well as men and women  a worthy gentleman of boston being about this time accused by those of andover he sent by some particular friends a writ to arrest those accusers in a  000 l action for defamation with instructions to inform themselves of the certainty of the proof in doing which their business was perceived and from thence forward the accusation at andover generally ceased  and now nineteen persons being hanged and one pressed to death and eight more condemned in all twenty eight about fifty having confessed themselves to be witches of which not one executed about one hundred and fifty in prison and above two hundred more accused the special commission of oyer and terminer came to a period after which six women who had confessed themselves to be witches gave under their hand that they did it only in compliance with their nearest friends who told them it was their only way to escape  as for the trials and the evidence taken for conviction at salem they are set forth in print by mr cotton mather in his wonders of the invisible world at the command of sir william phips then governor of new england but mr calef considering that his book might fall into the hands of such as never saw those wonders has transcribed here the whole account he has given thereof without any variation but with one of the indictments annexed to the trial of each after mr calef has set down mr mathers said account of the proceedings at salem he writes some animadversions on it and then proceeds to give an account of the proceedings in the like case at charlestown boston and other places and concludes with a proclamation at last issued out by the lieutenant governor counsel and assembly of the massachusetts bay wherein they beg god pardon for any errors might have been committed in the late prosecutions and upon the day of fast in the full assembly at the south meeting house in boston one of the judges who had sat in judicature at salem delivered in a paper desiring the prayers of the people to the like effect and some that had been of several juries gave forth a paper signed with their own hands owning that they feared they had been sadly deluded and mistaken and begged pardon of god and their country men for what had past and declaring that none of them would do such things again on such grounds for the whole world  i thought good to give this account at large of the two foregoing books because they give us a full information of the last considerable visitation by witchcrafts or so supposed that has happned to any country in the world and i hope it may be a farewell to them  as to my own opinion in these matters i am convinced by my own experience which to me is as a thousand witnesses that there is such a thing as a spectresight so that one person may see specter when others present at the same time see nothing wherefore i think it not impossible that the afflicted persons in new england should see nay i believe they saw the specter of persons who as they conceived tormented them all histories of witches both in england and in all other countries testifying the same though i no way think that such spectresight should be received a judicial proof against any person it being manifest by some foregoing examples that it is at least sometimes subject to illusions of which i shall here add a particular instance from frommannus who in his third book of magical incantation part   cap   dub    p     quotes the author of criminal cautions writing thus  a prince of germany invited two religious fathers of eminent virtue and learning to a dinner the prince at the table said to one of them father think you we do rightly in hanging persons who are accused by ten or twelve witches to have appeared at their meetings or sabbaths i somewhat fear we are imposed on by the devil and that it is not a safe way to truth that we walk in by these accusations especially since many grave and learned men every where begin to cry out against it and to charge our consciences with it tell me therefore your opinion to whom the father being somewhat of an eager spirit said what should make us doubtful in this case or what should touch our consciences being convinced by so many testimonies can we make it a scruple whether god will permit innocent persons should be so traduced there is no cause for a judge to stick at such a number of accusations but he may proceed with safety to which when the prince had replied and much had been said pro and con on both sides about it and the father seemed wholly to carry the point the prince at length concluded the dispute saying i am sorry for you father that in a capital case you have condemned your self and you cannot complain if i commit you to custody for no less than fifteen witches have deposed that they have seen you at their meetings and to show you that i am not in jest i will presently cause the public acts to be brought for you to read them the father stood in a maze and with a dejected countenance had nothing here to oppose but confusion and silence after all his learned eloquence so far frommannus  it is observable that when the spectresighted accusers came to an house to discover who afflicted a person taken ill it was ordinary for other young people to be taken in fits like the spectresightedpersons and to have the same spectresight as we know if a person falls into convulsion fits in the presence of young persons it is usual for these to fall into convulsions also  this strange visitation in new england in which persons were seized with strange fits and came to have a spectresight seems to be allied to what plutarch in his book of the virtuous acts of women relates concerning the milesian virgins as follows  there was a time that the milesian virgins fell into a strange humor and raving without any apparent cause only it was suspected that there was some venomous constitution of the air which caused in them this delirium and alienation of mind for they all on a sudden were seized with a desire to die and a furious inclination to hang themselves and there were many that secretly did it and no remonstrance nor tears of their parents nor consolation of friends availed any thing but they would destroy themselves and they always found means to elude all the subtleties and inventions of those that watched them so that it was looked upon as some divine punishment which no humane provision could remedy till at length by the advice of a wise citizen an edict was set forth that if any person should hang her self for the future her body should be carried naked through the open streets in the sight of all men which put a full stop to this tragedy and if instead of an indulgent non compos found generally by our juries of late on all felos de se somewhat exemplary were ordered by the government possibly it might deter persons from that crime plutarch notes it as a sign of a good and virtuous disposition that the fear of infamy and dishonor works more upon humane minds than the fear of those horrible accidents death and torments  rhodiginus writes thus its said the abderites ant lect l  0 c   while lysimachus ruled began to be infested with a certain new and wonderful kind of disease the manner of it was thus first there generally reigned among them a fierce and burning fever when the seventh day was come an abundance of blood flowed from their nostrils some fell into a plentiful sweat and this ended the fever but a very ridiculous affect seized the minds of them all for they were stirred up to act tragedies and thundered out iambicks with a very loud voice but chiefly the tragedy of andromeda writ by euripides and the words of perseus the city was filled with these kinds of weekly tragedies the people bawling out these and the like kind of words o king thou love of gods and men this unusual delirium held a long while till the winter and a fierce cold coming put an end to the evil it is thought the rise of this disease proceeded from this that at that time archelaus a famous tragedian in the midst of the summer when the heats were very great acted there andromeda whereupon the abderites contracted the cause of their disease in the theater and when as its usual the appearances of what was acted in that tragedy were presented to their minds they fell to the said tragedy through a delirium upon their recovery andromeda sticking in their memories and persus with medusa  l   c   as to a disposition of the air in reference to a spectresight purchase in the second part of his pilgrim writes from a relation of sandyss journey from venice to constantinople as follows we lay in a little bay and under a clift in the gulf of calonus where not one of us but had his sleep interrupted by fearful dreams he that watched affirming that he had seen the devil so that in a great dismay we put from the shore about midnight but whether it proceeded from the nature of the vaporous place or that infested by some spirit i leave to decide it is reported of a little rocky island hard by named formerly aex sacred to neptune that none could sleep on it for being troubled with apparitions the gulf belongs to the island mitylen or lesbos  thus we find what dispositions of mind men may fall into sundry ways and how far the diabolical seisures relating to practices of witchcrafts may be caused upon the minds of miserable people being impregnated with notions of demons and the like and what communication of minds there may be betwixt such people will deserve consideration  hippocrates in his tract of virgins diseases if it be his enquires into the nature and causes of such distempers as afflicted the milesian virgins and considers the disease called sacred which he says is attended with frights and terrors by which persons are vehemently scared so that they grow delirious and sometimes by night sometimes by day and sometimes both night and day they think they see demons infesting them and that upon those visions many have hanged themselves though more women than men they being of a weaker disposition of mind and virgins that are almost ripe for marriage find this about the time of the first descent of their menses being free from those evils before but about that time the due course of the blood being stopped it returns up to the heart and midriff causing an acute inflammation and brings an alienation of mind with cries and terrors and sometimes he says without specter a certain pleasure of death seizes them as seeming a good thing as they return to themselves he says the women are wont to consecrate their most precious garments with other things to diana being deceived by the prophets who command them so to do  now though the causes assigned by hippocrates seems plausible enough for him as a physician yet i doubt they will not reach all cases and we must have recourse to a superior science for them it is known to the learned that there has been a science in the world called scientia umbrarum which as to the public teaching of it has been suppressed upon good politic grounds though there are still some societies of men in the world who allow the study of it and teach it to persons of whose integrity they are satisfied and as boesatas says of magic of which this is apart est tanquam res sacra quae no nisiviris magnis and peculiari beneficio de caelo instructis communicatur and nil ausi sunt aggredi quidam principes in politicis in sacris in consibiis sine eorum arbitrio  calumella knew there was a science built on higher principles than what are accountable for in physics when he said concerning the cure of his bees  de cult hort l  0 at sit nulla valet medicina repellere pestem dardaniae veniant arts  but if this plague no medicine can repel to arts dardanian let us fly  the scientia umbrarum being a branch of these arts the ignorance of which possibly may have been the occasion of many mistakes in judicial proceedings relating to witchcraft the dispositions of the astral man being knowable only by that science and though many severities have followed upon it yet good policy perhaps has rather chosen to suffer them than to admit the public teaching of that science which might have been of more pernicious consequence to the public but i write these things only by the by and as opening  it seems to me that mr calef deals somewhat hardly with mr mather in this that when for his satisfaction mr mather had sent him a paper attested by several subscribers that margaret rule with whom they were present was lifted up to the ceiling of the room and that several times notwithstanding the endeavors of strong persons to keep her down and there held her for a considerable time and that they had much ado to pull her down yet mr calef declares his disbelief of it for this reason that then miracles are not ceased as though a manifest experience were to be so exploded i have given before two experiences in the like kind one from mr glanvil concerning a person so lifted up in the lord orerys house in ireland another from wierus a person well known to have been of no light belief who declares that a woman had been carried up in the air by spirits if himself had not violently withheld her and kept her down as to his great ground of the cessation of miracles i well know many learned divines have been of that opinion though i think it no such essential point of faith that christianity cannot well consist without it dr brown in his religio medici writes thus that miracles are ceased i can neither prove sect    nor absolutely deny much less define the time and period of the cessation sect    and again therefore that miracles have been i do believe and that they may yet be wrought by the living i do not deny and dr stubbe in his account of the miraculous cures wrought by mr greatrix writes according to the impetuosity of his spirit that to say miracles are ceased is a groundless folly if not a disingenious impudence in giving the lie to various religions and if mr calef admitted the point of margaret rules being so lifted up i cannot see why this must be concluded a miracle unless all things providence permits the devil to act and which seem strange shall be called miracles  and whereas mr calef so often urges mr mather with mr gaules fourth head for convicting a witch viz that a witch is one that maligns and oppugns the word work or worship of god and by any extraordinary signs seeks to seduce any from it as appears deuteronomy       matthew      act     0   timothy    which mr calef will have to be the only head well proved in the scripture for discovering a witch and often challenges mr mather to produce any other and says that his not bringing plain scripture proof that there is a covenanting witch is a sufficient demonstration there is none it is no consequence but there may be such a witch and that fairly reducable to the head of witchcraft mentioned in the scriptures for as there are new diseases of the body which were unknown to the ancients so i know not why there may not be new distempers of the mind all crimes being such and since mr calef stands so much for plain scripture proof for what he credits he may do well to give us a plain convincing scripture proof setting by his own glosses for the ceasing of miracles or of the time that providence tied up its hands from doing any thing beside the ordinary course of nature or from commanding or permitting any good or evil angels to do any such thing  i think it worthy consideration that in the account the abovementioned mr greatrix gave of himself and his actions in a letter to the late mr boil printed in london an      there seems a strange agreement in some particulars with what happened in the new england visitation for as the persons there afflicted as soon as they looked on those that afflicted them would fall down in fits so mr greatrix writes somewhat of the like nature relating to himself addressing himself to mr boil as follows  sir i hope you will pardon me when i relate to you my own observations and what my experience inclines me to believe in saying that i have met with several instances which seemed to me to be possession by dumb deaf and talking devils and that to my apprehension and others present several evil spirits one after the other have been pursued out of a woman and every one of them has been like to choke her when it came up to her throat before it went forth and when the last was gone she was perfectly well and so continued there have been others that have fallen down immediately as soon as they have seen me which the mayor of worcester colonel birch major wild and many hundreds both at worcester and here in london and other places were eyewitnesses of many when they have heard my voice have been tormented in so strange a manner that no one present could conceive it less than a possession as i will instance in one at yorkhouse where sir john hinton colonel talbot and many others were present who had somewhat within her which would swell her body to that excessive degree on a sudden as if it would burst her and then as soon as i put my hand on that part of her body where it did rise up it would fly up to her throat or some other place and cause her neck to swell half so big again and then almost choke her then blind her and make her dumb and foam and sometimes fly into her hand and so contract and fastn it that neither sir john hinton or any else that did try as there were many could with all their strength open one finger of her hand nor would it fly his hand in the least nor any other persons there till i put my hand on it or my glove nay i oftentimes brought it up into her tongue by running my hand on her body on the outside of her clothes up to her throat which was swollen in an instant as big again and has been seen plainly to fly from place to place and at length with great violence of belching which did almost choke her and force her eyes to start out of her head it went forth and so the woman went away well whether this were a natural distemper let any one judge that is either divine philosopher or physician i could instance you in forty as strange or stranger but i will go no farther then london and places adjoining for instances of this nature  he adds beneath that going to the town of copoqueen in ireland there were many poor people that came out of england for several distempers they labored under and among the rest two that had the falling sickness who no sooner saw me but they fell into their fits immediately and upon putting my hands on them they were restored to their senses forthwith and he pursued their pains from place to place till they went out of them so far mr greatrix  here we find that as the persons afflicted in new england as soon as they looked on the afflictors or so by them supposed fell into their fits and were restored to themselves upon the afflictors touching them so the distempered persons as soon as they looked on mr greatrix fell into their fits and upon his touching them were recovered  there was a book printed in london an      intitld enthusiasmus triumphatus written by one who assumed the name of philosophilus parresiastes near the end of which we find a relation of a person who had a power of healing by stroaking like that of mr greatrix the relation is thus p    it is very credibly reported and i think cannot be denied that one by the stroaking of a mans arm that was dead and useless to him recovered it to life and strength when i heard of it and read some few pages of that miraculous physicians writing my judgment was that the cure was natural but that his blood and spirits were boiled to that height that it would hazard his brain which proved true for he was stark mad not very long after  now however this person might have valued his skill in judging of an ensuing madness in such cases the effect having followed here according to his guess yet we find it will not hold in all cases mr greatrix having always lived free from any such sequel  to proceed to other accounts of persons who have had a perception of genii or spirits not visible at the same time to others the famous torquatus tasso prince of the italian poets strongly asserted his own experience in that kind his life was writ and published in french an      by d c d d u who in his preface tells us that in what he has writ he has followed chiefly the history given us in italian by john baptista manso a neapolitan gent who had been a very intimate friend to tasso in his life among other things he acquaints us that tasso was naturally of that melancholic temperament which has always made the greatest men and that this temperament being aggravated by many hardships he had undergone it had made him sometimes beside himself and that those melancholic vapors being dissipated he came again to himself like those that return from fits of the falling sickness his spirit being free as before that near his later end he retired from the city of naples to his friend manso at bisaccia a small town in the kingdom of naples where manso had a considerable estate and passed an autumn there in the divertisements of the season as hunting visiting ladies and frequenting other companies etc and here the french author gives us an account of tassos sensible perception of a genius as follows as after these amusements he usually retired to his chamber to entertain himself there with his friend manso the later had the opportunity to enquire into one of the most singular effects of tassos melancholy of this heroic melancholy as i may call it which raised his spirit so far it was from rendering it obscure and which among the ancients would have caused them to have ascribed a familiar demon to him as to socrates they were often in an hot dispute concerning this spirit with which tasso pretended to have a communication i am too much your friend said manso to him one day not to let you know what the world thinks of you concerning this thing and what i think of it my self is it possible that being enlightnd as you are you should be fallen into so great a weakness as to think you have a familiar spirit and will you give your enemies that advantage to be able to prove by your own acknowledgment what they have published to the world you know they say you did not publish your dialogue of the messenger as a fiction but you would have men believe that the spirit which you make to speak there was a real and true spirit so that men have thence drawn this injurious consequence that your studies have embroiled your imagination so that there is made in it a confused mixture of the fictions of the poets the inventions of the philosophers and the doctrine of religion i am not ignorant answered tasso of all that is spread abroad in the world on the account of my dialogue i have taken care diverse times to disabuse my friends both by letter and word of mouth i prevented even the malignity of my enemies as you know at the time i published my dialogue men could not be ignorant that i composed it for the young prince of mantua to whom i would explain after an agreeable manner the principal mysteries of the platonic philosophy it was at mantua it self after my second flight from ferrara that i formed the idea of it and i committed it to paper a little while after my unfortunate return i addressed it to this prince and all men might have read in the epistle dedicatory the protestation i there make that this dialogue being writ according to the doctrine of the platonicks which is not always conformable to revealed truths men must not confound what i expose there as a philosopher with what i believe as a christian this distinction is by so much the more reasonable that at that time nothing extraordinary had happened to me and i spoke not of any apparition this can be attested by all those with whom i lodged or frequented in this voyage and therefore there is no reason for confounding the fiction of my dialogue with what has happened to me since i am persuaded of all you say to me replied manso but truly i cannot be of what you believe at present concerning your self will you imagine to your self that you are in commerce with a spirit and i ask you of what order is that spirit shall us place him in the number of the rebels whom their pride precipitated into the abyss or of the intelligences who continued firm in faith and submission to their creator for there is no mean to take in the true religion and we must not fall into the extravagances of the gnomes and silphes of the cabalists  now the spirit in question cannot be a demon you own that instead of inspiring you any thing contrary to piety and religion he often fortifies in you the maxims of christianity he strengthens your faith by profound reasonings and has the same respect with you for sacred names and things neither can you say that it is an angel for though you have always led a regular life and far from all dissoluteness though for some years past you have applied your self after a particular manner to the duties of a true christian you will agree with me that these sorts of favors are not common that a man must have attained to an high degree of sanctity and not be far from the pureness of celestial spirits to merit a familiar converse and bear an harmony with them believe me there is nothing in all these discourses which you imagine you have with this spirit you know better than any man those symptoms which the black humors wherewith you are tormented causes in you your vapors are the sourse of your visions and your self would not judge otherwise of another person to whom a like thing should happen and you will come to this in your own respect also if you will make a mature reflection and apply your self to blot out by an effort of reason these imaginations which the violence of your evil effect causes in you you may have reason replied tasso to think so of the things that pass in me but as to my self who have a sensible perception of them i am forced to reason after another manner if it were true that the spirit did not show himself to me but in the violent assault of my vapors if he offered to my imagination but wandering and confused species without connection or due sequel if he used to me frivolous reasonings which ended in nothing or if having begun some solid reasoning he left it off on a sudden and left me in darkness i should believe with you that all that passes is but dreams and fantoms but it is quite otherwise this spirit is a spirit of truth and reason and of a truth so distinct of a reason so sublime that he raises me often to knowledges that are above all my reasonings though they appear to me no less clear that he teaches me things which in my most profound meditations never came into my spirit and which i never heard of any man nor read in any book this spirit therefore is somewhat of real of whatsoever order he be i hear him and see him nevertheless for its being impossible for me to comprehend and define him manso did not yield to these facts which tasso would have passed for proofs he pressed him with new questions which were not without answers since you will not believe me on my word said tasso to him another day after having well disputed i must convince you by your own eyes that these things are not pure imaginations and the next day conversing together in the same chamber manso perceived that on a suden he fixed his eyes toward the window and that he stood as it were immovable he called to him and jogged him many times but instead of answering him see there the spirit says tasso at last that has been pleased to come and visit me and to entertain himself with me look on him and you will acknowledge the truth of what i say manso somewhat surprised cast his eyes toward the place he showed him and perceived nothing but the rays of the sun passing through the glass nor did he see any thing in all the chamber though he cast his eyes round it with curiosity and he desired him to show him the spirit which he looked for in vain while he heard tasso speak with much vehemence he declares in a letter which he writ concerning this to the admiral of naples that he really heard no other voice but tassos own but they were sometimes questions made by him to the pretended spirit sometimes answers that he made to the pretended questions of the spirit and which were conceived in such admirable terms so efficacious concerning subjects so elevated and so extraordinary that he was ravished with admiration and dared not to interrupt him he hearkened therefore attentively and being quite beside himself at this mysterious conversation which ended at last by a recess of the spirit as he found by the last words of tasso after which tasso turning himself to him well said he are your doubts at last dissipated on the contrary answered manso i am more imbroyled than ever i have truly heard wonderful things but you have not showed me what you promised me you have seen and heard resumed tasso perhaps more than  he stopped here and manso who could not recover himself of his surprise and had his head filled with the ideas of this extraordinary entertainment found not himself in a condition to press him farther mean while he engaged himself not to speak a word to any man of these things he had heard with a design to make them pulick though he should have liberty granted him they had many other conversations concerning this matter after which manso owned he was brought to that pass that he knew not what to think or say only that if it were a weakness in his friend to believe these visions he much feared it would prove contagious to him and that he should become at last as credulous as himself  i was willing to set down this relation at large because i think it contains a sufficient answer to what many learned friends have said to my self on the like occasion  perhaps it may not be ungrateful to the reader if i subjoyn here the short eloge writ on tasso by the famous thuanus which is as follows  torquatus tasso died about the forty fifth year of his age a man of a wonderful and prodigious wit who was seized with an incurable fury in his youth when he lived at the court of ferrara and nevertheless in lucid intervals he writ many things both in verse and prose with so much judgment elegancy and extreme correctness of style that he turned at length that pity which many men had conceived for him into an amazement while by that fury which in others makes their minds outrageous or dulls them after it was over his understanding became as it were purified more ready in inventing things more accute in aptly disposing them after they were invented and more copious in adorning them with choice of words and weight of sentences and that which a man of the soundest sense would scarce excogitate at his leisure with the greatest labor and care imaginable he after a violent agitation of the mind set beside it self naturally performed with a wonderful felicity so that he did not seem struck with an alienation of mind but with a divine fury he that knows not these things which all men know that have been in italy and concerning which himself sometimes complains though modestly in his writings let him read his divine works and he must necessarily conclude either that i speak of another man than tasso or that these things were written by another man than tasso  what shall we say of horace as to a sensible perception of spirits who seems to desire posterity to believe him where he says bachum in remotis carmina montibus vidi docentem credit posteri nymphasque discentes carm l   ode    and aures capripedum satyrorum acutas evoe recenti mens trepidat metu bacchus in distant rocks i have seen teach charms and nymphs to learn of him believe it and the pricked up ears of goatfeet satyrs oh it scares me still to think on it with new fears   and i know not why horace though an epicurean being enthusiastically raised might not have seen apparitions as well as other men as when with a scalded imagination he crys out quo me bachae raptis tui plenum quo nemora came l   ode    aut quos agor in specus velox mente nova   cruquius has writ a learned comment on the former ode of horace which i recommend to the curious readers perusal he there reflects on lambinus who in his comment on the same ode says  credat judaeus apella non ego  he not having duly examined the scope of that divine poet in that ode  having averd my own experience in seeing genii or spirits i shall conclude this chapter with what the most ingenious poet says of himself in the like case  facta canam sed erunt qui me finxisse loquantur nullaque mortali numina visa putuent est deus in nobis agitante calessimus illo impetus hic sacrae semina mentis habet fas mihi praecipue vultus vidisse deorum fast  vel quia sum vates vel quia sacra cano they are facts i will sing though some may say i feign and think no gods were ever seen by man god reigns in us bys actings we take fire such salleys seeds of sacred mind inspire of all men i may freely gods behold or cause i am prophet or gods truths unfold chap v what perception men have had of genii or spirits and their operations by the sense of hearing thyraeus tells us l de appar dei voc c    that god proposed to himself in his way of acting with men first to render himself familiar to them afterward in succeeding times to remit somewhat of his familiarity at last to govern men not by himself but by men  the most familiar way that god has manifested himself to men has been by presenting himself in an outward appearance and speaking to men in an humane shape he came somewhat short of this when he was only heard and not seen it is inferior to both when he was neither seen nor heard but insinuated himself in a dream or the fancy the lowest degree was when he occupied only the understanding of man  if we run over and examine all gods manifestations of himself we shall find for the most part that to the first men god oftenest presented himself in an outward humane form afterward that with later men he had discourses hiding his external form thirdly that he was neither seen in a personal shape nor his voice perceived but he accomplished many things in dreams fourthly that he enlightened the mind yet it must no be thought that god so nicely orvd this rule that he never passed it by for when he has appeared in an outward form he has often also been heard often appeared in dreams often enlightened the understanding again in later times also sometimes he has been seen sometimes heard but i relate what has happened for the most part  the minds of men being at length practiced he afforded them his presence partly by oracles which he gave viva voce partly the understanding being enlightened by himself and the ministry of angels he in a manner withdrew himself and governed men by men as his deputies and left them in a manner to themselves as he now governs them so far thyraeus  i have premitted this from thyraeus to give a general notion of the manifestations of god and the intellectual world to man this doctrine being strongly backed by the scriptures and delivered down to us from all ages as likewise that genii spirits angels and demons have manifested themselves to man after the like manners  appar dei visib c   now thyraeus tells us farther that as these manifestations differ in excellency according to the dignity of the powers they are made to and each power has its dignity according as it is abstracted from matter so the sight in this regard exceeding the hearing the imagination the sight the understanding the imagination the most excellent manifestation will be the intellectual next the imaginary then the visible and in the last place the vocal  as i pretend to consider chiefly these two last ways and have already given accounts in reference to the sense of seeing i shall here give instances of what perception men have had of genii or spirits by the sense of hearing the manifestation of socratess genius beforementioned being by a voice and many having heard strange voices or noises who have never seen any thing and as to these voices or noises heard we must consider them in a twofold respect either only the person concerned hears them and not others present at the same time as it was the case of socrates or they are heard by all persons present i shall therefore first give a few instances of the latter and then of the others only noting by the by what wierus says of these voices or noises viz de praef daem l   c    spirits appear sometimes invisibly so that only a sound or voice or noise is perceived by men viz a stroke or knocking or whistling or sneezing or groaning or lamenting or clapping of the hands to make men attend to enquire or answer so far wierus  in luthers colloquia mensalia tom   c de spectris etc set forth in latin at francfort an      it being a different collection from that of aurifaber which is translated from the high dutch into english we have the following relation  it happened in prussia that as a certain boy was born there presently came to him a genius or what you please to call it for i leave it to mens judgments who had so faithful a care of the infant that there was no need either of mother or servant and as he grew up he had a like care of him he went to school with him but so that he could never be seen either by himself or any other in all his life afterward he traveled into italy he accompanied him and whenever any evil was like to happen to him either on the road or in the inn he was perceived to foretell it by some touch or stroke he drew off his boots as a servant if he turned his journey another way he continued with him having the same care of him in foretelling evil at length he was made a canon and as on a time he was sitting and feasting with his friends in much jolity a vehement stroke was struck on a sudden on the table so that they were all terrified presently the canon said to his friends be not afraid some great evil hangs over my head the next day he fell into a fever and the fit continued on him for three whole days till he died miserably  demon l   c   the second instance i shall give is from bodin which though it has been printed in english already yet it relating to the point i am treating of and containing many pertinent instances i have thought fit to insert it here he writes therefore as follows i can assure you a person now living has told me he had a spirit daily attending him and that he began to have knowledge of him about the   th year of his age though he believed he had accompanied him all his life by preceding dreams and visions he had to keep him from vices and inconvenicies but he never sensibly perceived him as he had done since his   th year which happened to him he says having for a year before continually prayed to god heartily morning and evening that he would please to send him a good angel to guide him in all his actions since as he told me he begun to have very instructive dreams and visions sometimes for him to correct one vice sometimes another sometimes for keeping himself from danger sometimes for resolving him of one difficulty sometimes of another and this not only concerning divine but likewise humane things among others he seemed to hear a voice of god in his sleep saying to him i will save thy soul it is i that appeared to thee before since that every morning about three or four of the clock the spirit knocked at his door and he rose sometimes and opened his door but saw no body and every morning the spirit continued and if he did not rise he knocked again and kept him waking till he rose then he began to be afraid thinking it some evil spirit as he said and therefore continued to pray to god without failing a day that he would send him a good angel and often sung the psalms which he could say in a manner all by heart and then the spirit made himself known to him as he was awake striking softly the first day so that he sensibly perceived many strokes on a glass viol which very much amazed him and two days after having a friend of his the kings secretary who is still living dining with him the secretary heard the spirit strike after that manner on a little stool standing by him whereupon he begun to look red and to fear but he said to him be not afraid it is nothing however to give him an assurance he related to him the truth of the fact now he has assured me that since the spirit has always accompanied him giving him a sensible sign as touching him sometimes by the right ear if he did somewhat that was not good and by his left ear if he did well and if any one came to deceive and surprise him he presently perceived the sign at his right ear and if it were some good man and came for his good he perceived also the sign at his left ear and if he were about to eat or drink any thing that was evil he perceived the sign if he doubted of doing or undertaking something the signal happened to him if he thought of some evil thing and was at a stand he presently perceived the sign to put him off from it sometimes when he began to praise god with some psalm or to speak of his wonders he found himself seized with a certain spiritual force which gave him courage and for him to discern a dream by inspiration from those idle fancies that happen when a person is indisposed or troubled in mind he was awaked by the spirit about two or three of the clock in the morning and falling asleep a little after he had true dreams of what he ought to do or believe or of doubts he had or of what would happen to him so that since that time he says there is scarce a thing that has happened to him but he has had an advertisement of it nor a doubt of things that he ought to believe but he has had it resolved he duly praying to god to teach him his will law and truth and as for his comportment otherwise he was of a joyous disposition enough in all his actions and of a gay spirit alleging to this purpose that passage of the scripture which says i saw the countenances of the angels joyful if he chanced in company to say some evil word or forbore some days to pray to god he was presently advertised in his sleep if he read in a book that was not good the spirit struck on the book to make him leave off and he was as soon directed if he did any thing against his health and was carefully guarded in his sickness in short he has told me so many particulars that it would be endless to relate them all but above all he was advertised to rise in the morning and commonly about four of the clock and says he heard a voice in his sleep which said who is it that will rise first to serve god he says also he was often advertised to give alms and the more alms he gave the more he found his affairs to prosper and as his enemies had resolved to kill him knowing that he was to go by water he had a vision in his dream that his father brought him two horses one red and the other white which made him send to hire two horses and his man brought him two horses one red and the other white he having not told him of what color he would have them i asked him why he spoke not openly to the spirit he answered me that he once prayed him to speak to him but presently the spirit struck with violence against the door as though it had been with an hammer giving him to understand that he took no pleasure in it and often he put him by of reading and writing that he might give rest to his mind and meditate alone he hearing often a very subtle and inarticulate voice i asked him if he had never seen the spirit in a form he told me he had never seen any thing waking unless it were a sort of a light in a round form and very clear i omit some other immaterial particulars concerning this person in bodin who concludes his relation of him thus i was willing to relate what i have known from such a person to let men understand that an association with evil spirits ought not to be looked upon as strange if angels and good spirits have such a society and intelligence with men but as for what he says that the good angel touched his ear this is well noted in the book of job chap    and in isaiah chap  0 where he says dominus vellicarit mihi aurem diluculo and job says it better yet discovering to understanding men the secret by which god by little and little makes himself sensibly known and as for what he says he heard striking with an hammer we read it was the first mark of the prophets for in the book of judges it is said of mnoa that the angel of god began to knock before him as rabbi david says where the hebrew word lepaghamo signifies to knock and to sound ring or ting from the word pahmon which signifies a little bell or tabrette etc so far bodin  mr baxter in his historical discourse of apparitions and witches writes thus there is now in london an understanding sober pious man often one of my hearers who has an elder brother a gentleman of considerable rank who having formerly seemed pious of late years does often fall into the sin of drunkenness he often lodges long together here in his brothers house and whenever he is drunk and has slept himself sober something knocks at his beds head as if one knocked on a wainscot when they remove his bed it follows him beside other loud noises on other parts where he is that all the house hears they have often watched him and kept his hands lest he should do it himself his brother has often told it me and brought his wife a discreet woman to attest it who averrs morever that as she watched him she has seen his shoes under the bed taken up and nothing visible touch them they brought the man himself to me and when we asked him how he dare sin again after such a warning he has no excuse but being persons of quality for some special reason of worldly interest i must not name him two things are remarkable in this instance   what a powerful thing temptation and fleshly concupiscence is and what an hardened heart sin brings men to if one rose from the dead to warn such sinners it would not of it self persuade them    it poses me to think what kind of spirit this is that has such a care of this mans soul which makes me hope he will recover do good spirits dwell so near us or are they sent on such messages or is it his guardian angel or is it the soul of some dead friend that suffers and yet retaining love to him as dives to his brethren would have him saved god yet keeps such things from us in the dark the same author in his said book has inserted a relation sent him by a gentleman in a letter concerning strange noises as follows  mr harlakenden who lived at coln priory in essex where i often was his son being my pupil formerly the house of the earls of oxford off from the house was a tombhouse with a chamber over it his butler robert crow and william his coachman used to lie in that room at two of the clock in the morning there was always the sound of a great bell tolling they affirming it so mr harlakenden slept in the evening so as to be awaked at one of the clock and lay betwixt his two servants to satisfy himself at two of the clock comes the usual sound of a great bell tolling which put him into a fright and sweat so as he jogd his servants who awaking said hark tom is at his sport it revived him to hear them speak upon a particular occasion mr thomas shepherd who afterward went to new england with some other ministers and good people spent a night in prayer and had some respect to the place serving god to cast out the devil and from that time never was any such noise heard in the chamber this i had from mr harlakendens own mouth and his servants ear witnesses when i was upon the place so far this account  another relation in this kind i have sent me in a letter by an ingenious and learned clergyman of wiltsire who had given me the relation before by word of mouth it is as follows  near eighty years since in the parish of wilcot which is by the devizes in the vicarshouse there was heard for a considerable time the sound of a bell constantly tolling every night the occasion was this a debauched person who lived in the parish came one night very late and demanded the keys of the church of the vicar that he might ring a peal which the vicar refused to let him have alleging the unseasonableness of the time and that he should by granting his desires give a disturbance to sir george wroughton and his family whose house adjoined to the churchyard upon this refusal the fellow went away in a rage threatening to be revenged of the vicar and going sometime after to the devizes met with one cantle or cantlow a person noted in those days for a wizard and he tells him how the vicar had served him and begs his help to be even with him the reply cantel made him was this does he not love ringing he shall have enough of it and from that time a bell began to toll in his house and continued so to do till cantels death who confessed at fisherton goal in sarum where he was confined by king james during his life that he caused that sound and that it should be heard in that place during his life the thing was so notorious that persons came from all parts to hear it and king james sent a gentleman from london on purpose to give him satisfaction concerning the truth of the report this relation i had from francis wroughton esquire sir georges son who lived more than ninety years he never heard the sound of the bell being abroad at school but he has heard it averred to be true by all the neighbors of repute and particularly often by his father who was at no small expense in entertaining strangers whose curiosity led them thither i have only this circumstance to add that the sound was heard only by those who were in the house nay if any one put his head out of the window he could not hear the sound which yet they at the same time did who were in the room  the gentlemans name who sent me this relation is wroughton and is of sir georges family  beda treating of the seven wonders of the world tells us that in the capital at rome there were statues set up for all the provinces conquered by the romans or images of their gods and that on the breasts of the statues the names of the nations were written and little bells were hung about their necks and priests were appointed to attend there successively day and night to guard those statues and to observe them with great attention whether any of them moved and caused the little bell to ring by which they knew what nation was about to rebel against the romans of which the priests gave the roman princes notice who presently provided for things accordingly  angelus rocca l de campan c   tells us of many bells that were wont to sound before persons deaths of their own accord accounts of the like nature having been given us by other writers and monsieur de lancre in his book intitld of the inconstancy of demons and evil spirits tells us that in the town of bourdeaux there was an honest canon of a church who had his house for some time troubled with spirits and that among other things there was heard almost every night a kind of music like that of an espinette set with certain little bells so pleasant that this partly took from him the fear and apprehension of the spirits  kircher in his obeliseus pamphilius p     tells us the egyptians thought that by the sound of the sistrum their priests were variously inspired for performing works of divination which jamblicus well explains saying various kinds of motions in the world answer to various orders of the gods and certain kinds to certain of them now from these various melodies flow which likewise agree each by their motions to certain gods in order the principles of those motions these being every where bestow their gifts chiefly to those that belong to them are chiefly present to sounds and melodies that chiefly agree to them and insinuating themselves into our spirits affected with them they possess the man and presently wholly work in him by their essence and power  i shall conclude this chapter with a relation somewhat in this kind from paracelsus though how far spirits may be concerned in the matter i shall not determine  he begins the sixth book of his archidoxes thus no man can deny but compositions of metals may work wonderful things in supernaturals which may be made good by many proofs as i shall clearly show beneath for if you compound all the seven metals in a due order and fit time and melt them together as it were into one mass you will have such a metal in which all the virtues of the seven planets are joined together you will find all these virtues in that one metal which we call electrum and beneath he writes you must know that our electrum which is compounded of the seven metals drives away all evil spirits for in our electrum the operation of the heavens and influences of the seven planets are stored up therefore the ancient persian magi and the chaldaeans found out and performed many things by its means i cannot here conceal a very great miracle which i saw wrought by a spanish nercromancer who had a bell not exceeding two pounds weight which as often as he rung he could cause to appear about him many spirits and specter of various kinds for when he pleased he drew some words and characters on the inward surface of the bell and afterward if he rung it a spirit presently appeared in any form he would have him by the sound also of the said bell he could draw to him also or drive from him many other visions and spirits and even men and beasts as i saw with my eyes many of these things done by him but as often as he would undertake some new thing so often he renewed his words and characters but he would not reveal to me the secret of these words and characters though deeply considering the thing my self i at length casually found it which i shall not here disclose but i plainly enough observed there was more importance in the bell than in the words for the bell was certainly made of our electrum so far paracelsus  i may here note that some persons have told my self that they have seen a constellated plate here in london made of such electrum which if put under a mans pillow at night will make him hear heavenly music  chap vi what perception some persons have had of genii or spirits and their operations by the sense of hearing when others present have heard nothing though as ludovicus vives says l de anim c de cogn inter good and evil spirits have certain actions unknown to us as men have among themselves which brutes understand not for as men move each others fancies and minds by words nods gestures letters or signs which surpass the knowledge of brutes so spiritual essences may agitate our fancy by some action proper and known only to themselves the imaginative faculty first moved yet we do not ascribe all strange things wrought by the fancy to the operation of spirits for as the same author says some by the mere action of the fancy seem to have got themselves posted in a state of great happiness as we find of him in horace   fuit haud ignobilis argis qui se credebat miros audire tragaedos in vacuo laetus sessor plausorque theatro caetera dum vitae servaret munia recto more bonus sane vicinus ambailis hospes comis in vxorem posset qui ignoscere servis et signo laeso non insanire lagenae posset qui rupem and puteum vitar patentem hic ubi

error nimirum sapere est abjectis utile nugis epist l   ep   et tempestivum pueris concedere ludum  a gentleman of greece thought he heard acted wondrous tragedies and sat and clapped them at an open stage in all things else comporting him as sage good neighbor truly hospitable friend kind to his wife if servants did offend would easily pardon not over stirred to wrath could shun a rock and precipice in his path this man by charge and care of friends being cured his sense with helebore and good wine restored when come to himself cried friends you have killed m outright not saved me thus extorting my delight and robbing m of my minds delusive joys it is good to please us thus with abject toys and in fit time to allow their sport to boys this instance we find relates to the sense of hearing  horace saying he heard actors when only the person concerned hears though we may probably judge he saw the actors as well as heard them so galen tells us of a certain physician l de symp diff c   named theophilus who being ill of a fever heard musical instruments continually playing in his chamber and being recovered persisted still to affirm the thing real cent   hist    so bartholin tells us of a student of a melancholic complexion and distracted with grief for the death of a sister who said he heard a celestial kind of music  we know its said of pythagoras and apollonius tyanaeus that they heard the harmony of the spheres which though some interpret otherwise i know not why it may not be thought they heard some celestial harmony this having happened to several persons beside themselves an ancient contemplative gent now living in london has told me that for forty years past he had never retired to contemplation as he daily did but he heard an heavenly music and i know many others who have often heard the same as i must declare i have often heard it my self though other persons present with us at the same time hear it not as we do  delrio and torreblanca write disq mag l   quest    sect   l de mag operat c    that the hearing being vitiated is wont to deceive us as it happens in persons troubled with the morbus imaginosus of which distemper learned men make two kinds one more commonly called a frensy when phantasms are represented to the mind in visible species concerning which kind you may cousult cornelius celsus and claelius aurelianus and this belongs to the depravation of the fancy the other kind is called corybantiasmus which takes sleep from the sight and vitiates the ears whereby men seem to hear ringings and sounds  concerning this disease scaliger writes thus corybantiasmus is a disease of the imagination in ctuli which superstitious antiquity believed to be sent by the corybantes it seemed to the persons affected with it that their ars were always filled with a noise of music and singing those who labor under this disease are troubled with watchings or want of sleep or at least with a light sleep having their eyes open for they have always their minds intent on images whence those that sleep with their eyes open were said to act like the corybantes such having no sound sleep by reason of images and sounds so varro in prometheo satyr levisomna mens sonorinas imagines affatur non umbraentur somno pupilla   to this relates that passage of plautus in some comedy of his the name of which is still in question  mecum habet patagus aes morbus l   c    which passage in the notes set forth by gronovius on macrobius is referred to the corybantes or priests of cybele patagus denoting the shaking of their heads aes the confused sound of brass whence is that of the poet  nec te progenitum cybeleius aere sooro lustravit corybas  the disease it self is called corybantiasmus to this claudian seems to have alluded l   in ruff   impatiensque sui morbus  and lucretius sollicitae porro plenaeque sonoribus aures  the word patagus comes from  cum strepitu palpito item percutio ferio for when the corybantes were raised in a fury they shakd their heads danced and run against each each other striking their brass bucklers and causing a ringing of brass not without a rhythmical composition of the dactyle foot from which foot and mount ida they were called dactyli idaei  now though there be such a disease causing musical sounds in the ear this cannot rationally be imputed to pythagoras apollonius or the gentleman i before mentioned and others they not being troubled with want of sleep or short disturbed sleep nor sleeping with their eyes open which are set forth as symptoms of it  to proceed to give an account of a perception of other sounds by the hearing which by some are imputed to spirits by others to other causes we find among the superstitious observations of the gentiles if any person had a ringing in his ears it was taken as an omen and as pliny says l    c   it was usual for persons absent to perceive that others were talking of them by a ringing in the ear and to this purpose there is an elegant latin epigram writ by a very ancient poet and first made public by joseph scalliger as he says c    in his notes on ausonius garrula quid totis resonas mihi noctibus auris nescio quem dicunt nunc meminisse mei hic quis sit quaeris resonant tibi noctibus aures et resonunt totis delia te loquitur non dubie loquitur me delia mollior aura venit and exili murmr dulce fremit delia non aliter secreta silentia noctis summissa ac tenui rumpere voce solet why ring al night my prattling ear they say i know not who is talking now of me would you know who your ear all night does sound all night it is delias voice there does rebound it is surely delia talks of me a noise comes soft and gently with sweet murmuring voice even as my delia with soft voice delights to break the secret silence of the nights   var hist l   c    and as aelian tells us pythagoras thought somewhat divine lay hid in these ringings he saying the sound which very often happens in the ears is the voice of the gods or demons  as for the way that men perceive these sounds and voices sect antiq l   c  0 rhodiginus tells us that socrates perceived his spirit by sense not by the sense of his body but as the platonicks were fully persuaded by the sense of the aetheastreal body lying hid within us after which way also avicenna thought angels were wont to be seen and heard by the prophets for the words of demons pass every where l de daem socret as plutarch says but their sound is only heard by those that keep their minds in a calm and composed state undisturbed by passions whom we call sacred and demonial men unless we had rather explain socratess perception of his demon in alcib plat according to proclus as follows the voice did not come to socrates passively from without but an inspiration of his demon from within proceeding throughout the whole soul and passing to the organs of the senses a voice at length manifested it self as coming to knowledge not so much by sense as by consent for such illustrations are wont to happen from good demons and the gods whence maximus tyrius says you wonder sacrates came to a familiarity with a demon who was as a friendly prophet to him and continually so attended him that he seemed as it were interwoven with his mind  so piccolomeni says l de  soc l de rero vel c demon socrates heard the voice of his demon not with the ear of his body but of his mind wherefore others did not hear it for it was an internal representation of the voice to the common sense and fancy  james gohory also who took on him the name of leo suavius in his comment on a passage in paracelsus l   de vita longa c   tells us of a sound that is made by the powder of projection in the transmutation of metals which i think is to be taken in a spiritual sense of which sound he says the mystical books of the spagyrists make mention as augurellus  indicio est etiam sonus hinc obtusus and aure deprehendi haud facilis  he adds the author of the dangerous fountain says there is made a certain melody which sometimes ceases as it were by the magic art and elsewhere the wonderful sound of a strange bell strikes my ear and paracelsus himself says l de vit long c   tympanaque nobis anonididica reddunt by the word anonididica meaning gentle anodine sounds composing the mind  cardan writes thus de rer var l    c    not only in all sneezings but in other kinds of presagings there are these things to be observed first that it be no natural thing but something differing from the natural as it was in that ringing wherewith i was admonished for many years of any fame or rumor concerning me for this was not like to a morbous affect which now i have sometimes experience of for this is inward and as it were fixed and troublesome light and coming from without and as it were separate moreover it shakes my whole head as though it would compel me to take notice of it a wonderful thing truly and almost incredible and it is known chiefly from this that it is familiar and in a manner always happens when i am upon some business of concern nor does it happen in diseases so far cardan we know the causes of common ringings in the ear  schol salern motus longa fames vomitus percussio casus ebrietas frigus tinnitum causat in aure but these ringings cardan speaks of are of another nature of which i have had a woderful experience my self though i may not express it as luther does c    who in his table talk tells us that an    0 he was at coburg where he was plagued in such sort with a sounding and ringing in his ears that it was as if a wind went out of his head c    the devil driving it  ricoldus in his confutation of the law given by mahomet to the saracens writes thus  mahomet being troubled with the falling sickness a disease incident to great men as aristotle observes in socrates callimachus and hercules in prob to whom we may add scotus and many others least others should think him really troubled with it still as he fell down in his trances said that an angel conversed with him and gave him certain answers with the sound of a bell in his ear instar campanae auribuscrcumsonantis  now as for hearing sounds of bells i never heard of any person who has had so much experience in that kind as my self though i know one person and have been well informed of others who have sometimes heard the sounds of bells after the same manner but in two spiritual visitations that have happened to me some years distance the one from the other of which i may give some account in this book i have heard bells for several weeks together and that of all sorts from the greatest church bells to a little hawks bell sometimes i have heard a church bell gently tolling sometimes bells ringing in peal solemnly as at a funeral sometimes merry round ringing as at weddings for some weeks together every night as soon as i was in bed a spirit came with a little bell ringing in my ear and a voice always talking to me and many other varieties i have had in that kind and that both by day and by night though no person present with me at the same time has heard any thing as they told me upon my enquiry of them i have heard every night for some time hundreds of spirits coming as it seemed to me first at a great distance singing and ringing hand bells who gradually approached my house the sound seeming nearer and nearer till at length they came to my chamber windows and some would come into my chamber the first ringing sound i heard was of a bell gently tolling at one of my chamber windows which looks to the south and at the same time at the same window i heard a spirit striking gentle strokes with a small rod as it seemed to me on a brass pan or basin tuning his strokes to a call he used come away to me come away to me and just upon it another spirit at another of my chamber windows which looked to the east called to me in a louder and earnest tone come away to me come away to me i shall here forbear any farther particular account in this kind as to my own experience and shall set down somewhat relating to what is said before as to ringing of bells and brass practiced by the ancient gentiles  l de camp c   fast l   angelus rocca tells us it was believed by the gentiles that the manes or rather demons were driven away by the ringing of brass or bells as it appears from ovid where he says of the ghosts or manes  rursus aquam tangit temesaeaque concrepat era et rogat ut tectis exeat umbra suis cum dixit novies manes exite paterni respicit and pure sacra peracta putat again he washes rings tempsaean brass and prays the manes from his house to pass then nine times cries paternal ghosts be gone so looks about thinks sacred rites are done therefore the gentiles thought that by the sound of bells evil or offensive genii were driven away or restrained from giving disturbance because the manes as hieronymus magius says were thought to love silence whence by the poets they were called silentes as ovid says in the same book mox etiam lmures animas dixere silentum  wherefore as often as such ghosts have spoken they are said to have used rather a low and muttering voice than a clear one as ovid says ib  umbra cruenta remi visa est assistere lecto atque haec exiguo murmr visa loqui remus his bloody ghost stood by the bed and with low murmur these words uttered in reference to this remigius writes concerning such as were accused of witchcraft daemona latr l   c   and converse with evil spirits as follows nicolaea granatia eva hesoletia jananigra armacuriana and many others say the spirits have such a voice as one that puts his head in an empty hogshead or crazed vessel and therefore always in speaking hold their heads downwards as persons ashamed or self conscious of some crime are wont to do or at least they have a small and weak voice so hermolaus barbarus said he heard a voice of an hissing demon as he answered himself and georgius placentinus asking him concerning the meaning of aristotles entelechia the elm also mentioned in philostratus that is as i conceive the demon of thespion speaking from the elm by his command who was the eldest of the gymnosophists saluted apollonius coming to them with a slender voice the lecanomancy also of the assyrians and chaldaeans was wont to effect this that the demons delivered their words from the basin with a stridulous and low hissing so far remigius  l   c    ita ori to this i may add what le loyer writes in in his history of specter viz damascius a pagan philosopher relates that the familiar spirits lying hid in round consecrated bowls which he calls betyles answered those that consulted them in a small and inarticulate voice that it seemed rather an hissing than a speech and had need of interpreters the name betyls is syriack and was taken from the hebrews who called those places bethel where the patriarch jacob placed stones for a mark that he had there adored god the syrians turned this to their superstition and called betyles their animted stones or stones in which a god or demon was hid our learned seldom writes of those betyles l de diis syris  but to pass by other relations in this kind and to speak of my own experience some spirits that conversed with me for some months together had a lowsunk voice as many persons have in colds but it was without any hoarseness being very clearly discernable the spirits i heard coming to me singing in the evenings had clear voices and that spirit which came nightly to me for some time with a bell in my ear had a very clear and resonant voice  brss and its ringing were also used by the gentiles on several other accounts and that for the same reason viz it is purifying nature l   c   concerning which cael rhodig writes thus the interpreter of theocritus in the poets phrmcutria writes that brass was thought by the ancients to be of great virtue in scred rites and excantations and therefore was wont to be used in eclipses of the mon and at mens deaths because it was thought more pure than other things and expiatory of pollutions therefore they used it in all purifications as apollodorus has writ l de diis and sophocles in his tragedy which is called rhizotomi that is the cutters of roots writes of medea cutting herbs with a brass knife and putting the juice into brass vessels and macrobius writes that brass vessels were used chiefly in those sacred rites with which they would compose the minds of persons or consecrate them or cure diseases and the priests of the sabines were wont to have their hair cut with a brass knife and it is manifest that the most ancient greeks used in many things the sound of brass as a most powerful thing as for the reason of the ancients in giving aid to the moon when in an eclipse by a confused noise of brass alexander gives it us thus men rung iron and brass because they thought demons were driven away by it at the time that the planets cannot convey their influence to the earth which is for the benefit of men  some tell us that by the ringing noise of brass the force of magic charms was hindered from reaching to the moon the charmers voice being confounded by it and that by this means relief was thought to be given the moon when in a eclipse for brass is the most sonorous of all the metals it having a shrill and penetrating sound whence homer gave juno the epithet  and spondanus on homer thinks a most resonant voice was aptly given her because a voice is nothing but the air struck and by juno is meant the air  l de tintin c    magius says the searchers into natural causes think by the sound of bells the violent injury of tempests winds and hailstorms is driven away because such ringing greatly agitates cuts and breaks the air which appears from hence that when bees rise in a swarm and begin to fly away they are forced to pitch again by a gentle ringing of brass the air being cut and severed and scarce bearing their flight though some think bees then pitch upon the airs being moved because they are delighted with the ringing which i leave to the judgment of others  l de diis apollodorus says the priest of proserpina was wont to ring a little bell in her sacred ceremonies and the priest of the syrian goddess also was wont to use a little bell l de dea syria as lucian writes the priest after he is come to the uppermost part of the temple prays for the whole congregation and in praying he also rings a certain little bell robertellus also in octavian augustus gives testimony of this custom when he speaks of the gates and tops of temples l    the top is compassed about with bells the bells were wont to hang for the most part over the gates of temples  fungerus in his etymologicum trilinque tells us the hebrew word for aes is necuschoh or nechoscheth from the word nachosoh that is he made an auguration he has divined he has ominated he has had certain conjectures some think the reason of the name to be that happily from the sound of a ringing bell some observation was made in auguries divinations and the like conjectures and gronovius in his learned exercitations on stephanus byzantinuss fragment de dodo tells us that because oracles and divinations are denoted by the word nechosoh which signifies also brass and lebetes hence in the dodonaean oracle brass bells lebetes and tripods were excogitated when only oracles and divinations were to be understood mr rosse in his view of the religions of asia will have it that the bells hanging at the pallium of the high priest of the jews denoted christs prophetic office though i know other significations are ascribed to it by other writers and plutarch in symposi introduces metagenes an athenian who as well for other reasons there given as for the jews high priests wearing the said bells which make a noise as he walks will have the god of the jews to be the same with bacchus because in their country in the nocturnal sacrifices of bacchus called nyctelia they made a great noise and the nurses of bacchus were called chalcodristae as much as to say scrapers of brass the strong impression made on me by the noise of bells in my spiritual visitations led me to draw these things together from the ancients which i leave to the readers consideration  chap vii what perception men have had of spirits and their operations by all their senses though the senses of seeing and hearing are the chief senses concerned in a perception of spirits and their operations yet the other senses sometimes are some way affected by them for as st austin says the evil work of the devil creeps through all the passages of the senses he presents himself in figures applies himself to colors adheres to sounds introduces odours infuses himself in savours and fills all the passages of intelligence sometimes cruelly tormenting with grief and fear sometimes sportingly diverting man or taunting with mocks  according to this passage of st austin mr john pordage in his book writ in vindication of himself from necromancy etc published in london an      after having set forth that his maidservant elizabeth benwel had deposed before the commissioners that she had heard music in his house when she knew not that any instruments or musicians were in the house and that she had heard it in the kitchen and in her mistresses closet and thought the same to be near her but saw none playing which fact mr pordage does not oppose and he there confessing that in august      there appeared in his bedchamber about the middle of the night a spirit in the shape of one everard whom he suspected to be a conjurer and to be instrumental in raising up those apparitions which himself and others saw with his wearing apparel bands cuffs hat etc who after his sudden drawing of the bedcurtains seemed to walk once through the chamber very easily and so disappeared and that the same night there appeared to him a great dragon which seemed to take up most of a large room having great teeth and open jaws whence he often ejected fire against him which came with such a magical influence that it almost struck the breath out of his body and this apparition continued till the day began to dawn and then disappeared i say having set forth this he proceeds to declare some extraordinary things which few had been made acquainted with and which at that time were seen and experimented by himself and others with him he writing as follows  our inward spiritual eyes being opened in an extraordinary way two invisible internal principles were laid open and discovered to us which may be called mundi ideales being two spiritual worlds which seemed very much differing the one from the other as having contrary qualities and operations by which they work upon this visible creation he says one of those internal worlds may be called mundus tenebrosus the dark world whose objects by their correspondent inward faculties or senses were then discovered and made known to them the other world he says may be called mundus uminosus or the light world which with its various objects was then likewise opened to their inward senses for beside their internal sight they had their other internal spiritual faculties of spiritual sensation opened to discern their various objects within these worlds    as to the objects of the internal sight when the dark principle or world was opened they beheld innumerable multitudes of evil spirits or angels presenting themselves in appearing distinctions of order and dignity the princes of this dark world and their subjects presented themselves as passing before their eyes in pomp and state all the mighty ones appearing to be drawn in dark aerie clouds chariots with six or at least four beasts to each one beside every figure or similitude of a coach was attended with many inferior spirits as servants to the princes the animals that drew the cloudy coaches appeared in the shapes of lions dragons elephants tigers bears and such like terrible beasts besides the princes and those that attended them though all in the shapes of men yet represented themselves monstrously misshapen and with ears like those of cats cloven feet ugly legs and bodies eyes fiery sharp and piercing beside these appearances within the spirits made some wonderful impressions on bodies without as figures of men and beasts upon the glasswindows and the ceilings of the house some of which yet remain but what was most remarkable was the whole visible world represented by the spirits upon the bricks of the chimney in the form of two half globes as in maps after which upon other bricks of the same chimney was figured a coach and four horses with persons in it and a footman attending all seeming to be in motion with many other such images which seemed to be wonderful exactly done now fearing lest there might be any danger in these images through unknown conjuration and false magic we endeavored to wash them out with wet clothes but could not finding them engraven in the substance of the bricks which indeed might have continued till this day had not fear and suspicion of witchcraft and some evil design of the devil against us in it caused us to deface and obliterate them with hammers  he adds beneath but to shut up this relation of the objects we saw in this dark world i must add this that were but the eyes of men open to see the kingdom of the dragon in this world with the multitudes of evil angels which are every where tempting and ensnaring men they would be amazed and not dare to be by themselves without good consciences and a great assurance of the love and favor of god in protecting them by the ministration of the holy angels    as to the objects of the inward and outward smell he says that within three weeks space in which these wonders appeared at several times the evil angels or spirits raised up such noisome poisonous smells that both the inward and outward parts of those that were exercised with them became much disturbed and offended for through the sympathy betwixt the body and the soul the sulphurous hellish smells much exercised both by magical tincturation    in reference to the objects of the taste he says that sometimes both night and day they were exercised with the loathsome hellish tastes of sulphur brimstone soot and salt mingled together which were so loathsome to them that they were like to cause great distempers and nauseousness in their bodies had they not been supported by god beyond their own strength    in relation to their outward and inward touch they were much exercised both in body and soul as to their souls they sometimes felt such strange and magical wounds and piercings by the fiery darts of the devil that none can express them but those that have been exercised in some measure as job was as to their bodies they felt material impressions from the powers of darkness very noxious in themselves as to their natural spirits and life but born by them by quiet submission to the will of god  as to the internal light world   there appeared then to their inward sight multitudes almost innumerable of pure angelical spirits in figurative bodies which were clear as the morning star and transparent as crystal sparkling like diamonds and sending forth beams like the sun powerfully refreshing their souls and enlivening their bodies    in relation to the inward sense of hearing there were many musical sounds and voices like those that st john heard in mount sion the sweetness harmony and pleasantness of which cannot be expressed nor that spiritual joy and delight which by them was infused into their souls be uttered by the tongue it ravishing their spirits into the high praises of jehovah    in relation to the faculty of smelling the tongue can hardly express those heavenly odours and perfumes which then were smelt piercing into the very spirit beside the quickening virtue which by them was communicated and insinuated into the spirits of their outward bodies which like a cordial had been able to have renewed the strength of their languishing nature    their sense or faculty of tasting was very pleasantly entertained with those invisible dews which were sweeter than honey with which instead of food they were many times wonderfully refreshed    in relation to the sense of spiritual contact that was also delighted with its heavenly objects for he says none can utter those pleasing impressions which the burning tincture of the light world afforded them coming like an hot cordial into the center of their spirits being sensibly felt in the inner parts so as to cause much joy and heavenly pleasures which penetrated through their souls and gave them occasion to praise and magnify god  thus he says for the space of three weeks or a month they were exercised inwardly and outwardly through that great combat that was betwixt those two worlds and their inhabitants the dark world sometimes afflicting them with dreadful shapes abominable smells loathsome tastes with other operations of the evil angels the light world at other times opening and relieving them with odoriferous perfumes most sweet dews glorious visions and angelical harmony he adds that now for the space of   years ever since the time of these great manifestations they have enjoyed the exercise of their spiritual senses which were never since shut nor would be unless through transgression and disobedience they ran back into the earthly nature  i have set down this relation in short from mr pordage and as for the truth of it it must rely upon him and the other persons then concerned with him but for my self i have no reason to question the truth of it it being usual with those that are trained up to a contemplative life to have visitations in that kind both internal and external  l   part   c  0 the learned walter hilton a great master of a contemplative life in his scale of perfection sets forth that appearances or representations to the corporeal senses may be both good and evil writing as follows  by what i have said you may somewhat understand that visions or revelations or any manner of spirit in bodily appearing or in imagining sleeping or waking or any other feeling in the bodily sense made as it were spiritually either by sounding in the ear or savouring in the mouth or smelling at the nose or else any sensible heat as it were fire glowing and warming the breast or any other part of the body or any other thing that may be felt by bodily sense though it be never so comfortable and liking yet are they not contemplation it self but simple and secondary though they are good in respect of the spiritual virtues and of this spiritual knowing and loving of god accompanying true contemplation but all such manner of feeling may be good wrought by a good angel and they may be deceivable wrought by a wicked angel when he transfigures himself into an angel of light for the devil may counterfeit in bodily feeling the likeness of the same things which a good angel may work for as a good angel comes with light so can the devil and as he can do this in matters of seeing so can he do it in matters of the other senses he that has felt both can well tell which were good and which were evil but he that has never felt either or else but one of them may easily be deceived  these two are alike in the manner of feeling outwardly but they are very differing within and therefore they are not to be greatly desired nor to be entertained lightly unless a soul can by the spirit of discretion know the good from the evil that it be not beguiled as st john says trust not every spirit   john     but try first whether it be of god or no and to know whether the representation to the bodily senses be good or evil chap    hilton gives the following rule  if you see any manner of light or brightness with your bodily eye or in imagination other than every man sees or if you hear any wonderful pleasant sounding with your ear or have in your mouth any sweet sudden savor other than what you know to be natural or any heat in your breast like fire or any manner of delight in any part of your body or if a spirit appear bodily to you as it were an angel to comfort you or teach you or if any such feeling which you know well comes not from your self nor from any bodily creature beware at that time or presently upon it and wisely consider the stirrings of your heart for if by occasion of the pleasure and liking you take in the said feeling or vision you see your heart drawn from the minding and beholding of jesus christ and from spiritual exercises as from prayer and thinking of your self and your defects or from the inward desire of virtues and of spiritual knowing and feeling of god to set the sight of your heart and your affection your delight and your rest principally on the said feelings or visions supposing that to be a part of heavenly joy or angels bliss and thereupon come to think that you should neither pray nor think of any thing else but wholly attend thereto for to keep it and delight your self therein then is this feeling very suspiscious to come from the enemy and therefore though it be never so liking and wonderful refuse it and assent not thereto for this is a slight of the enemy to let and beguile the soul by such bodily savours or sweetness in the senses to bring it into spiritual pride and into a false security of it self flattering it self that it had thereby a feeling of heavenly joy and that it is half in paradise by reason of the delight it feels about it when indeed it is near to hell gates and so by pride and presumption it might fall into errors or heresies or phantasms or other bodily or spiritual mischiefs  but if it be so that this manner of feeling lets not your heart from spiritual exercises but makes you more devout and more fervent to pray more wise to think spiritual thoughts and though it be so that it astonishes you in the eginning nevertheless afterward it turns and quickens your heart to more desire of virtues and increases your love more to god and to your neighbor also it makes you more humble in your own eyes by these tokens you may know it is of god wrought by the presence and working of a good angel and comes from the goodness of god either for the comfort of simple devout souls to increase their trust and desire toward god to seek thereby the knowing and loving of god more perfectly by means of such comforts or else if they be perfect that feel such delight it seems to them to be an earnest and as it were a shadow of the glorifying of the body which it shall have in the bliss of heaven but i know not whether there be any such men on the earth  he goes on of this way of discerning the working of spirits speaks st john in his epistle thus   john    omnis spiritus qui solvit jesum hic non est ex deo every spirit that looses or unknits jesus he is not of god this knitting and fastening of jesus to a mans soul is wrought by a good will and a great desire to him only to have him and see him in his bliss spiritually the greater this desire is the faster is jesus knit to the soul and the less this desire is the looser is he knit whatsoever spirit therefore or feeling it is which lessens this desire and would draw it down from the steadfast minding of jesus christ and from the kindly breathing and aspiring up to him this spirit will unkni jesus from the soul and therefore it is not of god but is the working of the enemy but if a spirit or a feeling or a revelation make this desire more knitting the knots of love and devotion faster to jesus opening the eyes of the soul into spiritual knowing more clearly and makes it more humble in it self this spirit is of god  and hereby you may learn that you are not to suffer your heart willingly to rest nor to delight wholly in any such bodily feelings of such manner of comforts or sweetness though they were good but rather hold them in your sight naught or little in comparison of spirital desire and steadfast thinking of jesus nor shall you fastn the thought of your heart overmuch on them  he goes on but you shall seek with great diligence in prayer that you may come to a spiritual feeling or sight of god that is that you may know the wisdom of god the endless might of him his great goodness in himself and in his creatures for this is contemplation and that other mentioned is none thus says st paul being rooted and grounded in charity ephesians     we may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth that you may know he says not by sound of the ear nor sweet savor in the mouth nor by any such bodily thing but that you may know and feel with all saints what is the length of the endless being of god the breadth of the wonderful charity and goodness of god the height of his almighty majesty and the bottomless depth of his wisdom in knowing and spiritual feeling of these should be the exercise of a contemplative man for in these may be understood the full knowing of all spiritual things etc  i have set down these things somewhat at large from this author because i conceive they may be useful to some men who lie under spiritual visitations of this kind we see he supposes it no uncommon thing for men to have their spiritual and corporal senses wrought on in this extraordinary way and teaches how they may discern good from bad in such cases i know the contempt many men have for studies of this nature but its not to those i here write nor is it every mans talent to be master of a contemplative life this person by a deep inspection into the disposition of mens minds in all the gradations of a contemplative life had a clear view of the figmentum of man in every posture of it and that discretion of spirits which the scriptures mention  somewhat being occasionally said before concerning the inward senses i shall here give you a short account of the internal senses according to the platonic philosophy by the benefit of which one man perceives what another does not  caelius rhodig tells us that the vivifying act of the soul on the vehicle that is ant lect l    c    on the ethereal body is called the idol of the soul but you must know this that the ancients thought there was in this idol a confused energy of the fancy without reason and such senses that the sight is generally propagated throughout this whole vehicle as likewise the hearing but that many do not enjoy these senses nor is it often but there is in them a power of an admirable nature so that the harmony of the spheres is perceived by them being otherwise silent and there is heard also a demonical voice and bodies present themselves to the sight if the soul withdraws it self in the aetherial corpuscle being after a manner severed from the clog of the terrestrial and gross body so its said that tatius the son of mercury being duly expiated by sacred rites presently cried out that he lived now in an immortal body and being carried aloft he saw and heard wonderful things which mercurius approving said the same was usual with himself there are some that write and among others the platonic olympiodorus that apollonius tyanaeus by the power of these senses when he was in the city being raised as it were on a watchtower saw and told what things were done in egypt plotinus thought that the first intellect was the first essence from which and in which other intellects are not only by ideas but by their proper intellectual existences as i may say of the soul according to an intellectual faculty proper to themselves even while they are in the body just as lines drawn from a center to a circumference do not depart from the center while they touch the circumference hence he will have it that the intellect of a prophet and of an abstracted man though it seems to be only in the east may have a prospect also of what things are done in the west because all intellects are every where and in each other since always they are all in the single divine mind which is always wholly present every where so far rhodig  now as the pythagoreans and platonicks who many of them had a sensible perception of what they called the harmony of the spheres divine voices etc set up these hypotheses for explaining things of this kind so it is no wonder that the other philosophers who had not such abstracted minds and had no sense of such things did not set up any hypothesis for explaining things they had no sense of and rejected or ridiculed any hypothesis of this nature  i doubt what i have here delivered may be too speculative to please all readers and therefore i shall not dwell upon things of this nature but only say in general that in all ages and in all religions there have been contemplative persons or such as have much spiritualized themselves in the study of divine things for detaching souls from the creatures by bringing them to an opening of their inward senses to fix them on the being infinitely perfect as the esseens among the jews and the platonicks among the pagans who detached minds as much as possibly they could from matter to fix them on metaphysical meditations and this is what is chiefly driven at by mystical divines among christians and it must be granted that humane reason stands much indebted to this philosophy for having driven the knowledge of god and of a being infinitely perfect and of the sole creator of the world much farther than other philosophers have done as monsieur dureux asserts in the beginning of his book entitled traitee historique sur la theology mystique  to add some farther explanation of the way that some persons see spirits when others do not cardan tells us that averrhoes l de mirab in his collectanea seems fairly to have accounted for it saying when the spirit which attends the imagination has by imagining received forms of a sound or of any quality for discerning by the smell or taste or of a dead man or of a demon and being imbued with it is conveyed to the sense which corresponds to that action as in odours to the proper instrument of smelling in hearing to the ears in specter to the eyes it will necessarily smell hear and see without any object for if seeing be naught but a perception of a species in the christalloides whether that species comes from the object or not its manifest as often as this happens it truly sees and so it happens that persons see demons or dead persons being awake and also hear voices of persons they know and smell smells and touch as in the incubi or succubi but these things are more seldom seen than they are heard or touched because in the rest of the senses it suffices to observe one difference and one only spirit conveyed to the sense with that image may represent this but as in the eyes there are more differences necessary magnitude form color of necessity more spirits must be conveyed and for this reason nature has made those nerves hollow which pass to the eyes and only those so because those in their operations stand in need of far more spirits than any of the other senses in discerning hence arises a solution of many problems which though carrying a certain truth yet have brought many to such streights that some have been fain to fly to miracle others to demons others have flatly denied the facts as in island and norway etc they think they see some of their family who are dead and think they embrace them and say they vanish in their embraces now island is full of bitumen and the inhabitants live on fruits roots bread made of fish and water and it lying in the frozen sea by reason of its great cold it cannot bear standing corn and much less wine whence the spirits by reason of the food the air by reason of the soil are very gross therefore by reason of the thickness of the air and the vapors concerted through cold images wander about as in the clouds which being conceived through error fear and thought the dense and earthy spirit so long retains till it be conveyed to the instrument of sense therefore they persuade themselves they see and talk with them they think they see persons of their acquaintance and such as are dead because they know they are not there living and because they vanish in their embraces but no man has feigned to himself an unknown figure in the clouds as of a chimaera or an hippocentaure for we are all carried to known things so far cardan  but after all this philosophizing for showing that all our senses may be imposed on by phantoms i do not find how this any way accounts for those apparitions which have revealed future or hidden things and the like which were not possibly discoverable by any assistance of our sense or reason  chap ix what perception men have had of genii or spirits and their operations by dreams to say absolutely that all dreams without any distinction are vain visions and sports of nature the images of things at random coming into our minds and possessing them while we sleep and to banish all divination from the life of man as epicurus meterodorus and xenophanes did is contrary to experience and the common consent and agreement of mankind so that we may argue with averrhoes in his paraphrase there is no man but has had dreams which have foretold him something and therefore they are not only the sports of nature and vain appearances l    pliny a man little credulous in matters of faith writes that the cures of many diseases unknown before had been discovered in dreams porphyrius to explain divine dreams says that god has given to each man two demons to attend him a good and a bad and that the good and propitious demons foreshew us in our dreams evils to come prepared for us by evil demons adding that if any man could rightly discern those things that are intimated to us in our sleep he would be freed from all evils and become an egregious prophet psellus l de demon says that demons come to those that are worthy of their society and give them the knowledge of future things and the platonicks deride the peripateticks for referring the works of demons as divinations a manifestation of occult things and the speaking of various tongues to humors and the steams of the earth  dion cassius writes thus the cause which moved me to write this history was this romans hist l    when i had writ a book of those dreams and prodigies which had given severus hopes of the principality and had sent it to severus and he had read it and had writ me back many kind things after receiving his letter in the evening i went to bed and in my sleep it was divinely commanded me to write an history wherefore i writ the things i now treat of which proving very pleasing to severus and others i presently resolved to go through writing the whole roman history and though i took upon me the composing of this history with reluctance and at first wholly rejected it my goddess encouraged me in my sleep and gave me good hopes that this history should never perish which goddess i take to be the guardianess of my life  the same author concludes the last book of his history thus at length being taken ill in my feet i was dismissed of all employs to pass all the remainder of my life in my country as my genius had plainly signified to me in bythinia who also once seemed to command me in my dream to add these verses to the end of my history  from arms and cruel slaughters dust and pain iliad   sustained in wars jove hector has withdrawn cardan though he had writ ten books of dreams yet in his book de mirabilibus tells us how he was often admonished in his dreams to write his one and twenty books de subtilitate of which the forementioned book is one and he says these did not seem dreams to him but somewhat greater and that his books de rerum varietate were so likewise shown him and that it was a property belonging to his family which he had both by his fathers and mothers side to dream of what would happen to him and this he has set forth that men may know there is somewhat in us besides our selves there is he says in all men but it incites some to virtue because they will have it so others to murder poisonings etc what says he do they think the mind of a wicked man to be is man there alone or are there fears hatreds suspiscions angers and torments of mind so that when a man has given himself over to their power he cannot be master of himself in all of us there are buried seeds and sprouts of a contrary faction wherefore no man can be excited to virtue nor have an experience of truth in dreams who overwhelms and buries that which is in him beside himself for there are three factions within us evil demons a clear light and pleasure wherefore true dreams a foresight of futurities and wonderful things happen even to wicked men i know what may be objected against me that forsooth i would seem a divine man do they think me of so little sense that i know not men will rather impute this as a vanity to me than turn it to my praise but the things i have seen and know i cannot conceal though it be to my extreme prejudice it is no small comfort to me that when the same things happened to galen the same fear the same suspicion which he confessed he was not ignorant of yet he chose rather to obey his impulse and not to conceal the things he knew to the hazard of his fame than to mind the glory of men if any man may happily suspect me for seeking from this an opinion of sanctity let him know that no man among the ancients more constantly asserted the mortality of the soul than galen and that i am a sinner wherefore the reason of these things must be deduct elsewhere for they belong to the books de arcanis aternitatis and de fato not to the present dispute nor are they proper for it so far cardan and i desire this may serve for an answer to what some men happily may be inclined to object to my self in reference to what i have delivered in this book as to any experience of my own in this or the like kind for i as freely own my self guilty of many failings as cardan did or any other man may  to come nearer to our times gssndus in the life of peireskius writ by himself relates so strange a dream which happened to him that peireskius upon telling it him more than once said that if another man had related it he should not have believed him  in his return anno    0 in the beginning of may from montplier to nismes he had in his company one james rainer a citizen of ix who was wont to lodge in the same chamber with him and now did so in an inn on the road as peireskius slept rainer observed he muttered somewhat to himself after an unusual manner whereupon rainer awakened him and asked him what was the matter oh said he from what a pleasant and grateful dream have you roused me rainer asking him what it was i was dreaming said he that i was at nismes and that a goldsmith offered me a golden medal of julius caesar for four crowns and i was upon paying him his money for it when upon your unseasonable awaking me both goldsmith and medal vanished they went on to nismes and being there peireskius took a turn in the city till dinner was ready and by a wonderful chance he happened on a goldsmiths shop and asked the goldsmith whether he had any rarity to show him he told him he had a julius caesar of gold he asked him the price and was answered four crowns which he presently paid him and taking the medal by an admirable hit of fortune he fulfilled his dream it may be said admirable for he might easily have thought of nismes where he was to be the next morning he might have thought of that coin of julius caesar which he had often wished for being awake he might have thought it found in that city in which there were so many footsteps of roman antiquities he might have thought at a goldsmiths to which sort of persons such things found are commonly carried he might have thought of a small price at which goldsmiths rather value those things than antiquaries he might have thought of four crowns with which moderate price a goldsmith might be content in short a goldsmith and that at nismes might have a medal of that price but its altogether wonderful that all those things should have concurred and the event answer the dream and nevertheless perieskius was not the man who for all this thought the cause of this dream preternatural as happily he might have done if the like dream had often happened but as he knew the sports of chance he only accounted this among those which by their rareness are wont to create a stupor in the vulgar so far gassendus  amyraldus writ a discourse in french concerning divine dreams which discourse was translated and printed in english an      in it this dream of peireskius is inserted and placed among angelical dreams i shall here give you some account of that discourse as follows  the first chapter treats of natural dreams which he concludes thus it is true sometimes it happens that some of these dreams come to pass which makes us think there is some resemblance or agreement betwixt the dream and the event and by consequence that some angel or spirit is concerned therein but as aristotle has observed this happens by mere chance as he that without any aim should shoot a thousand arrows may at last by chance hit the mark so in our dreams such an infinite number of visions ss in our imagination that it is not only no wonder if one should sometimes chance to be true but it would be much more strange if once or twice in our life it did not so happen but if any of our dreams do not only come to pass but there also is a remarkable agreement betwixt it and the event and such as we ought necessarily to suppose the operation of an intelligent agent to intervene we ought not then to reckon this among natural dreams but to refer it either to god or to some action of angels  his second chapter treats of angelical dreams in general with some reflections on particular dreams he says there are two sorts of dreams which we may impute to created intelligences one where the things signified are contained in symbolical and mysterious representations the other where they are proposed naked without any such resemblances the common rule of interpreting the former he says is to observe the agreements which are betwixt the dreams and their events and some of these dreams regard present others future things of both which he gives instances those other dreams which propose things nakedly as they are in themselves have no need of an interpreter to understand them but when the event confirms them they are not the less wonderful as the dreams of peireskius and others which he mentions  the third chapter treats of divine dreams which are also of two sorts one contains future things under enigmatical and mysterious representations the other are much more plain and naked of both which he gives instances concerning divine dreams in general he makes three enquiries   why god has sometimes revealed himself in dreams to his servants   how they could certainly know that those dreams had god for their author   whether this way of revelation by dreams be yet practiced and whether god does still make use of it under the dispensation of the gospel the first of these questions is treated of in this third chapter where he says that as god made use of various means to reveal himself to the prophets and by them to others so there is no reason why he should have excluded that of dreams and there is yet this farther reason in particular for them above the others that though there be a great deal of vanity in ordinary dreams and that those which proceed from angels have very often much uncertainty and ambiguity and that some philosophers as aristotle and others supposed no regard to be had to that way of divination yet it has always been almost the universal opinion of all nations that the divine being did principally communicate it self to men by dreams and generally this opinion in the eastern nations had a very great reputation so that it was principally in those nations that they have reduced the interpretation of dreams into an art and have laid down rules concerning it and because the people of israel were also of the same opinion god chose to send them such dreams as were truly divine thus to fix them to these and so divert them from that vanity to which other nations suffered themselves to be carried by those others beside the church being then in her infant state the people were more easily instructed by dreams than by other ways in which there was need of more clearness and strength of understanding  the second question concerning the characters by which we may know dreams truly divine from vain delusion is treated of in his fourth chapter where he would have us first note that among these dreams that proceed from the operations of angels there may also be found divine ones inasmuch as god does not only permit but may command the impression of them but those he properly calls angelical dreams are merely such as neither the formation of the images exceeds their power nor is the knowledge of the things which these images represent above their intelligence nor above the quickness of their conjectures and divination he calls some dreams divine because whether it were that god employed angels to convey them or whether they are immediately caused by himself the things signified by them far exceed the natural capacity of an angels understanding so that it was absolutely impossible they should ever attain to the knowledge of them but by a particular revelation therefore those dreams may be reputed to come from god which by what messenger soever they are conveyed yet contain such things as god only is able to know and reveal as for the marks of divine dreams he says it is certain that moses and others had some certain marks which absolutely determined them to set upon such actions as they did though others might not know wherein those marks did consist he observes that god rules in the understanding of wise and virtuous men and powerfully inclines it to a belief and resolution though it does not see in the object reasons altogether proportionate to the effect it feels in the soul so that the extraordinarily determination of the understanding is an evident proof of the divinity of the dream  the third question viz whether god makes use of this kind of dreams now under the dispensation of the gospel is treated of in his fifth chapter where he says that as for those divine dreams which are designed to foretell things to come under the emblem of an allegorical representation or to convey some new commands to men in order to some great and extraordinary design for which there is need of divine authority for the undertaking and executing of it he conceives that time is wholly expired and those who pretend to and boast of any such are either impostors who would abuse the world by their feigned visions to serve their own private interest or fools who have their brains disturbed by hypochondriacal vapors and here he delivers his thoughts concerning a certain kind of people of both sexes who both in poland and germany have pretended to divine visions in these latter days he does not accuse them of imposture they having given a sufficient experience of their piety but affirms that in their actions they had some transport of understanding which proceeded from some other cause than what was truly divine they were persons that gave themselves extraordinarily to the reading of the apocalypse and the other prophesies and their spirits were so possessed with the ideas of those things they there saw where future events were represented to them that they persuaded themselves their very dreams and the things they imagined they saw in those ecstasies they sometimes fell into were real and divine visions and what contributed to this belief was that they suffered themselves to be carried away by the hopes of those who expect in due time a prosperity of the church of god on earth and a terrible subversion of all those states and powers which now oppose the establishment of christs kingdom and as they zealously desired this they easily imagined it to be certain and indubitable diverse texts of scripture also having some seeming appearance of some such promises made to the church of christ beside the melancholic humor which was naturally predominant in them the afflictions hardships and anxieties they underwent as well from the public affairs as their own private concerns made them very ready to receive all impressions of fancy which might show them any hope of deliverance or any mitigation of their troubles be it then that either they dreamt or that waking they were surpised with some transport of fancy in which their soul was perfectly abstracted from the body and from all commerce with their senses as this sometimes happens in hypochondriacal distempers these apocalyptical images were thus put into a violent motion and framed in their imaginations those pretended visions which they have since related to us though we have seen in great part by experience that those images which they saw in their pretended enthusiasms either signified nothing at all or if they did yet their vanity and falseness have been confuted by the events  he subjoyns here a reflection on those are clled qurs for boasting of visions revelatios divine inspirations extraordinary gifts of the spirit of ecstasies and strange transportations who by their tremblings and quakings would represent the motions of enthusiasts and prophets and he tells us the spirit of christ is a spirit of understanding and prudence and of a sober and well settled sense and not a spirit which fills empty brains with dark and fantastical imaginations nor exposes the true religion to the laughter of its enemies and to the scandal of sober and intelligent men by its indecent and unnatural motions  as for those dreams which may proceed merely from the impression and operation of angels both good and bad he says he will not deny but there may be yet some examples of that kind to be seen and though the dispensation of the law under which good angels were more especially employed in things relating to religion be now passed yet they continue still to be ministers and instruments of divine providence in what relates to civil life and humane society and especially the protection of the faithful and the defense of the church of christ and as it is not impossible but they may sometimes appear to men waking so it is not incredible but god may make use of them from time to time to convey to men the notices of some things by dreams he says there are many examples of both kinds in the books of those who have made collections of them to which books he refers the reader but gives us one instance of monsieur calignan chancellor of navarre a man of singular virtue who being at bearne one night as he lay asleep heard a voice which called him by his name calignan hereupon awaking and hearing no more of it he imagined he dreamt and fell asleep again a little after he heard the same voice calling him in the same manner which made a greater impression on him than before so that being awakened he called his wife who was with him and told her what had happened so that they both lay waking for some time expecting whether they might hear the voice again at last the voice awakened him a third time calling him by his name and advised him to retire presently out of the town and to remove his family for that the plague would rage horribly in that place within a few days he followed the direction and within a few days after the plague began in the town and destroyed a great number of people now the author says whether the plague came by the infection of the air or by some infectious persons or whether some sorcerers and witches as they say they sometimes do diffused their infectious poisons in that place neither exceeded the knowledge of the angels that spoke to him he next relates a dream as strange which happened to lwis de bourbon prince of conde and in his conclusion he says there is need of great circumspection to judge of these nocturnal visions if any such dream induce us to a good action and from whence there can follow no bad event such a dream ought not to be suspected by us but if it prompts us to evil we ought absolutely to condemn and reject it as a delusion of the devil so far amyrldus  mlchn l de anima writes concerning the nature of dreams as follows i shall not follow the aages of natural philosophers who striving to refer dreams of all kinds to natural causes act foolishly but i find four kinds of dreams  the first is of vulgar dreams which may be called natural because the natural and immediate causes of them are in view as when images are presented of those things which we think on being awake or when dreams answer to certain humors a redundancy or agitation of which moves the imagation or spirits  the second kind i call presaging which nevertheless is not divine but as by a natural temperament or peculiar property or by a natural gift one person is more musical than another or has a greater activity of body etc so by a natural gift or property many have presaging dreams painting forth future events as it were by certain allegories so pontanus tells us that a certain soldier at genoa dreamt he was devoured by a serpent wherefore on a day when the other soldiers were put on board ships to fight with the enemy he kept himself at home but a tumult casually arising in the city he was killed by the ball of a sort of canon which we call a serpent this kind of dreams has not an apparent cause in the motion or plenty of the humors or the first qualities as we said of the first kind but there are certain presaging natures called by aristotle loquaces naturae  that have frequent signifying dreams nor shall i be against it if any men shall contend that the cause of this property is the excellency of the temperament as astrologers will have it but those are idle who deliver ways of explaining them and seek causes in the motion of humors  the third kind is divine which god sends into minds either by himself or by angels such as the scriptures tell us were divinely sent and these only are to be relied on as certain the others being all fallacious  the fourth kind is diabolical as when witches as it seems to them are present at feasts and sports when it has been often known by experience that they never went to them but as they lay sleeping signified by their gestures and cries that they dreamed of feasting and dancing of this kind have been many superstitious dreamers of former ages and in these our times we have heard of many fanatical dreams of anabaptists commanding crimes and confirming errors which are easily judged of by pious and prudent persons  sennertus in epit phys l   c   writes thus to supernatural dreams we refer all those which are sent us from superior causes and external to us be they from god angels or devils those that are sent from god and good angels are especially called divine whereof there are some instances in the scriptures for god is wont either to present new species to men in dreams or so to order and conjoyn those that are in men before that they are signs of future things and angels are wont to stir up and aptly dispose those species spirits and humors that are in the body that they admonish men of good and necessary things and diabolical dreams are caused the same way as by angels but for a different end viz the destruction of men  from these things it appears how even absent and future things may be presented to us by our dreams the platonicks think many dreams may be referred to their genii and demons which they think attend all particular persons and conclude that they admonish them of many things but our divines much more rightly refer them to angels which attend each man to which we may add what tertull writes viz l de anim the gift of divine dreams descends even on profane persons god equally affording rain and sunshine on the just and unjust since even nebuchadnezar had a dream sent him by god and as the favor of god reaches even the pagans so the temptation of the devil does the saints from whom he is never absent that he may steal upon them unawares when a sleep if he cannot prevail with them when awake  he there further philosophizes concerning dreams as follows  because in dreaming persons the fancy is employed and some fantasm is presented to it and we do not dream only of those things which we have done in the day or of those things which lie hid in the body but also of those things which are at a vast distance from us and which we have neither seen heard nor perceived by any sense nay of those things which are not yet in being but to come afterward its queried how the images of things absent and never perceived by the senses and which are not yet in being can be presented to the fancy the epicurens suppose that images which fly to and fro and wander in the air are the causes of this thing rhodig lect antiq l    c    denies those images but contends there are certain motions which exercise us instead of images and that those motions proceed from certain beginings of those things which are shortly after to be said or done by us the air first changed and then being conveyed through the passages of the ears and nostrils to the heart cause that we seem to foreknow the events of future things and these motions cannot at any time bring a more ample sense of themselves than in the night but how can there be motions of things that are not yet in being or how can things absent fifty or an hundred miles presently affect the air or why do not those motions affect all persons indifferenly asleep in their way but only those whom it concerns to know that thing we refer all those dreams which we have concerning things that we never perceived before by sense or from causes that do not lie hid in our body to a divine operation  l de diaet quercitan philosophizes of supernatural dreams thus supernatural dreams are in the middle betwixt divine and natural in regard their causes are neither referred immediately to god nor to the malignity of evil humors on which the rise of natural dreams depends but to our soul which is awake the body sleeping and which being stirred up by a certain supernatural rapt especially the good genius inspiring represents to us by dreams and visions many fantasms which for the most part presage somewhat certain the certitude of which is commonly known by the event of things many instances of those dreams occur where it has oftem seemed to persons in dreams that they fall into some disease or recover of it to which visions the event afterward answered to all things that they had seen before in their sleep though they were not desired nor sought for as diabolical dreams are wont to be sought for arnoldus de villa nova dreamt that he was bit in the foot by a black cat the next day there broke out in that part of his foot a cancerous and malignant ulcer so far quercitan  so simlerus tells us in the life of gesner that gesner on a night dreamt that he was bit by a serpent and the next morning said that he should be seized with a pestilential carbuncle a few days after a carbuncle appeared in his left pap five days before he dyed  to procceed now to give some farther instances of dreams from other authors fracastorius tells us that marcus antonius flaminius being at genoa and somewhat indisposed in his health borrowed a book of a friend to divert him which having read some days he chanced to leave it on a couch with some other books and that when the person that lent it came for it it could by no means be found in the night time he saw in his dream a maid servant of the house take the book from the couch and as she was laying it on a table the book chanced to fall on the ground and one side of the cover was broken and the maid hid it for fear in a secret place flaminius rising in the morning and remembering his dream sought for the book and found it in that place and charging the maid servant with what was done she confessed that all passed as he had said  celsus mancinius of ravenna has writ an ingenious tract intitld de somniis and synesi per somnia viz of dreams and a sagacious perception of things by dreams in which he has inserted the dream before set down in his work he has set forth the opinions of the most famous philosophers concerning the causes o dreams and though he allows the divine and angelical dreams recorded in the scriptures yet for all other wonderful dreams he thinks a reason may be rendered of them according to the doctrine of aristotle viz as casually happening he gives instances of many strange dreams and among others of that of flaminius and explains them all according to aristotles doctrine in his   th chapter he says its known that those who apply themselves to philosophy and other arts and sciences in their sleep by the help of a powerful imagination a recent exercise and a strong attention of mind discourse find out and do many things which they had not done nor were able to find out waking and he says flaminius saw those things in his dream because being troubled about the book he had borrowed and much concerned that he could not restore it he began to think where the book might be found he did not judge it stolen but seeing other books removed from one place to another viz from the couch to the table he began to consider who had done it as he thought of this no one could occurr to him more readily nor more suspected than the maid servant that constantly attended him that servant was doubtless free from any suspicion of theft for the book was not likely to yield her much money or to be of any use to her therefore he must conclude within himself that in carrying the books from the couch to the table that book casually fell and broke its cover and because people are wont to hide their faults or at least to lessen them by some excuse that simple maid fearing chiding or beating or lest some ill might follow wisely to avoid all hid the book in the most secret place she could as behind a chest or some like place having discourssd these things by night in his sleep and upon waking in the morning remembering his dream he tried whether it were true and found all things exactly to answer his dream he explains other strange dreams after the same manner according to aristotles opinion as casually happening by a lucky hit of the mind in its improved way of reasoning in our sleep  but i doubt this way of explaining will not do in all cases but we must often have recourse to the direction of some superior intelligences  mr cotton mather in his ecclesiastical history of new england writes thus l   c   example    within a fortnight of my writing this a physician who sojourned within a furlong of my house for three nights together was miserably disturbed with dreams of his being drowned on the third of these nights his dreams were so troublesome that he was cast into extreme sweats by struggling under the imaginary waters with the sweats yet upon him he came down from his chamber telling the people of the family what it was that had so discomposed him immediately there came in two friends that asked him to go a little way with them in a boat upon the water he was at first afraid of gratifying them in it but being very calm weather he recollected himself why should i mind my dreams or distrust divine providence he went with them and before night by a thunder storm suddenly coming up they were all three drowned mr mather says he inquired into the truth of this relation just as he writ it and could assert it  so again camerarius tells us in the life of melancthon that gulielmus nessenus on a day after dinner in a gentle sleep he had dreamt that he was passing a river in a fisher boat as he usually did for his diversion and that the boat striking on the trunk of a tree was overturned and he was drowned this dream he told to philip melancthon who then casually came to see him deriding withal the vanity of dreams but that same evening what he had dreamt came to pass  mr william smythies curate of st giless criplegate an school published an account of the robbery and murder of john stockden victualler in grubstreet within the said parish and of the discovery of the murderers by several dreams of elizabeth the wife of thomas greenwood a neighbor to the said stockden an abstract of which account i give you as follows  mr smithies first telling us that none can doubt but great discoveries have been made by dreams who read the life of sir henry wotton and our english chronicles particularly the murder of waters and the discovery of it by a dream recorded by sir richard baker in his chapter of casualties in the reign of james the first and other histories he says mr stockden was robbed and murdered by three men in his own house on the    d day of december      about midnight a little after the murder there came a woman into the street and said she believed one maynard to be one of the murderers because she was informed he was full of money both silver and gold upon which there was a warrant against him but he could not be found soon after this stockden appeared to elizabeth greenwood in a dream and showed her an house in thames street near the george and told her that one of the murderers was there she went the next morning and took one mary buggas an honest woman who lived near her to go with her to the place to which her dream directed and asking for maynard was informed that he lodged there but was gone abroad after that stockden soon appeared again to mrs greenwood and then representing maynards face with a flat mole on the side of his nose whom she had never seen signified to her that a wiredrawer must take him and that he should be carried to newgate in a coach upon enquiry they found out one of that trade who was his great intimate and who for a reward of ten pounds promised him on his taking undertook it and effected it he sent to maynard to meet him upon extraordinary business at a public house near hockley in the hle where he played with him till a constable came who apprehended him and carried him before a magistrate who committed him to newgate and he was carried thither in a coach  maynard being in prison confessed the horrid fact and discovered his accomplices who were one marsh bevel and mercer and said that marsh was the setter on being a near neighbor to stockden who knew he was well furnished with money and plate and though marsh were not present at the robbery yet he met to have a share of the booty mrsh knowing or suspecting that maynard had discoverd him left his habitation stockden appeared soon after to mrs greenwood and seemed by his countenance to be displeased he carried her to an house in oldstreet where she had never been and showed her a pair of stairs and told her that one of the men lodged there the next morning she took mry bugges with her to the house according to the direction of the dream where she asked a woman if one marsh did not lodge there to which the woman replied that he often came thither this marsh was taken soon after in another place  after this mr greenwood dreamt that stockden carried her over the bridge up the burrugh and into a yard where she saw bevil the third criminal whom she had never seen before and his wife upon her eling this dream it was believed that it was one of the prison yards and thereupon she went with mrs footman who was stockdens kinswoman and housekeeper and was gagged in his house when he was murdered to the mlshalsea where they enquired for bevil and were informed that he was lately brought thither for coining and that he was taken er the banside according to a dream which mrs greenwood had before of his being there they desired to see him and when he came he said to mrs footman do you know me she replied i do not whereupon he went from them mrs greenwood then told mrs footmn that she was sure of his being the man whom she saw in her sleep they then went into the cellar where mrs greenwood saw a lusty woman and privately said to mrs footman that is bevils wife whom i saw in my sleep they desired that bevil might come to them and first put on his periwig which was not on the time before the lusty woman said why should you speak with my husband again since you said you did not know him he came the second time and said do you know e now mrs footman replied no but it proceeded from a sudden fear that some mischief might be done to her who had very narrowly escaped death from him when she was gagged and as soon as she was out of the cellar she told mrs greenwood that she then remembered him to be the man they went soon after to the clerk of the peace and procured his removal to newgate where he confessed the fact and said to the grief of my heart i killed him  mrs greenwood did not dream any thing concerning mercer who was a party concerned but would not consent to the murder of stockden and preserved mrs footmans life nor has there been any discovery of him since but he is escaped and the three others were hanged  after the murderers were taken mrs greenwood dreamt that stockden came to her in the street and said elizabeth i thank thee the god of heaven reward thee for what thou have done since which she has been at quiet from those frights which had much tormented her and caused an alteration considerable in her countenance  this relation is certified by the lord bishop of gloucester who with the then dean of york the master of the charterhouse and dr alix had the particulars of the foregoing narrative from mrs greenwood and mrs buggas  when dr harvey who was afterward fellow of the college of physicians in london being a young man went to travel toward padua he went to dover with several others and showed his pass as the rest did to the governor there the governor told him that he must not go but he must keep him prisoner the doctor desired to know for what reason how he had transgressed he said it was his will to have it so the packet boat hoisted sail in the evening which was very clear and the doctors companions in it there ensued a terrible storm and the packet boat and all the passengers were cast away the next day the sad news was brought to dover the doctor was unknown to the governor but by name and face but the night before the governor had a perfect vision in a dream of dr harvey who came to pass over to calais and that he had a warning to stop him this the governor told the doctor the next day and the doctor told this story to several of his acquaintance here in london this relation i took from mr aubreys miscellanies and i think it hard i may say impossible to account for this dream and that of monsieu calignon before set down by any occult w of improved reasoning in our sleep  claude de tisserant a parisian printed an history of prodigies an      where he writes that the wife of one of the chief of the parliament of provence dreamt that her husband was executed as he really was in the city of paris and at her awaking found her hand so stiff that she could not ply it and in it was the image of her husband represented with his head cut off the said image being all bloody this image having been seen by many persons yet alive it not being above  0 years since the thing happened  alex ab alexand tells us genesis die l   c    that an ingenious young man who lived with him he having the care of his education saw in his dream his mother carried in a funeral to be interred whereupon he fell into great sighs and lamentations whom alexander caused to be awakened and then asked him why he so lamented he answered his mother was dead and in his sleep he saw her carrying to be buried alexander observed the day and time that this vision happened a little while after a messenger came to him with the news of his mothers death of whom asking the day it happened he found she died the same day that the vision was seen by which example he says with others of the like kind we are prompted to believe that god has given us a divinatory spirit and prophetic foresight of future things in our dreams  cardan writes thus synes somn l   c  0 joannes maria maurosenus a senator of venice my particular friend while he was prtor in dalmatia saw in his dream one of his brothers whom he much loved embrace him and bid him farewell because he was going to the other world joan maria having

paragraph that ludovicus madius his countryman had a soldier sleeping in a chamber who on a certain night cried out in his sleep his master asked him what ayld him he answered that he dreamt he had

tells us that one praestantius desired a solution of a doubt of a philosopher which he refused to give him the night following prstantius being awake saw this philosopher stand by and solve the doubt and presently to go away praestantius meeting him the next day asked him why having refused to solve the question the day before he came to him at midnight of his own accord and solved it to which the philosopher replied i come not truly but in my dream i seemed to do this to you  magnenu in his exercitations on tobacco says exer c   such dreams as these happen for that the person that dreams representing to himself such a man endeavors to produce a sense of things not beneath the authority of that man or the idea he has of him hence sometmies they have such conceptions which are owing not to themselves but to the reputation of so great a man wise epictetus very well knew this who commands that our mind be raised by some man of great repute which we may propose to our selves to be imitated and may hear and behold him as present propose to your self says he what socrates or zeno would do in such a case encri c    he adds beneath that sagacious virtue which exerts it self in man freely discovers it self by an instinctual impetus and i have often perceived in my sleep what exactly fell out the next day so when i have gone to sleep with a fixed thought on a person sick a meet remedy has been represented to me in my dream which nicely weighing in my judgment the next morning i have thought it excellent and given it with great success i had read the same had happened to hippocrates and galen but doubted of its truth but i have found by my own experience that a nature prone to a business finds most compendious ways for it which others scarce ever attain in vita minerva as ptolomy says cent    galen tells us that women while they are with child often see their childrens fortunes in their sleep and that cypsalis and pericles began to be formidable to greece from the womb here cardan adds the soul seems then to be most pure as it newly comes from heaven and to foresee and show future things to parents  in the life of the late sir henry wotton we find an account of a dream of his father thomas wotton esquire as follows a little before his death he dreamt that the university of oxford was robbed by townsmen and poor scholars and that the number was five and being that day to write to his son henry at oxford he thought it worth so much pains as by a postscript to his letter to make a slight enquiry of it the letter was writ out of kent and came to his sons hands the very morning after the night in which the robbery was committed for the dream was true and the circumstances though not in the exact time and when the city and university were both in a perplexed inquest of the thieves then did sir henry wotton show his fathers letter and by it such light was given to this work of darkness that the five guilty persons were presently discovered and apprehended without putting the university to so much trouble as the casting of a figuer  we are also told in the next paragraph that the said thomas wotton esquire and his uncle nicholas wotton who was dean of canterbury both foresaw and foretold the days of their deaths  selneccerus tells us in his calendar concerning christian king of denmark that he foretold his death both to his chaplain m paulus noviomagus and to d cornelius his physician jacobus scutellarius a famous astronomer of prague physician to the emperor rodolphus the second had a foreknowledge of his death eight days before it happened and affirmed for certain he should die on the  0th of december an      that famous astronomer leonardus thurnisser certainly foreknew the day of his death made his will and commanded his landlord that he should bury him by the side of albertus magnus which was done he died the  th of july an      there is at rome this monument  to seraphinus oductius strancionicus famous physician a most ingenious prophet and a man skilled in all manner of learning who being seized with a vehement fever foreknew and most constantly foretold the day and hour of his death theophilus his son erected this monument he died the   th of the calends of sept an      having lived    years   months and    days  this i take from kormannus l de mirac mort part   c  0  who in the said book and the same part c     writes as follows concerning presaging dreams that dreams sometimes presage death many examples testify that of king pharaohs baker genesis c   the dream of lucius scylla the roman the dream of calphurnia the wife of julius caesar the dream of cicero in valerius the dream of alexander the great in the same the dream of simonides the dream of cressus king of lydia the dream of the arcadian in megra in the same the dream of flav valerius of marcian the emperor the dream of elizabeth de larche the mother of the puelle of orleance the dream of polycarpe the dream of the scholar of pavia all which m ancermus julianus has learnedly compiled in his book of dreams and nocturnal visions  an ancient gentleman now living in london has told me that many years since he had occasion to make a journey into the north and that being a bed in his inn the first night of his journey a friend of his dead not long before appeared to him in his dream and told him he had lodged  000 l in the hands of a person whom he named and who was well known to the gentleman i write of for the use of his daughter and he desired him that upon his return to london he would put the person in mind of it and desire him to take care to pay the money the gentleman after his return took an opportunity to wait on the said person and after common discourses were over told him that such a friend of theirs whom he named lately dead had communicated a secret to him viz that he had lodged  000 l in his hands for the use of his daughter and that as she would grow marriagable in a short time he might do well to pay it the person freely owned the thing and paid the money accordingly the gentleman from whom i had the relation having known nothing of it but in his dream and this is remarkable that the gentleman who paid the money chanced to fail in about three months after  to give some account of what experience i have had my self in dreams synesi some l   c   as cardan tells us that beside the oracle and prophecy there are four kinds of dreams viz monitory persuasive deterring and impelling so i have had some of all these four kinds and have been guided by them in many material circumstances of my life many times the genii which have attended me as i have lain in my bed have bid me go to sleep saying that they would suggest something to me in my dream which they have performed and when the dream was over they having suggested what they pleased they have sensibly pushed my shoulder or taken me by the armrist or touched some other parts of my body to awake me and have bid me consider of what i had seen in my sleep and though i have then generally found the things enigmatically represented yet the meaning was obvious enough and i have guided my self by it  dr bekker who takes upon him to solve all appearances in dreams or others by natural reason without any agency or spirits in the third volume of his work entitled lmonde enchante c    writes thus there is a certain way of presage or of prognostic signs which relates to certain particular persons and their concerns when a man by some extraordinary vision by the hearing or some sensible perception of something is advertised before hand of something which will happen to him or of what is presently to happen this is what i agree in and i shall give the reason of it in my fourth part and here i shall only explain the thing after the way i conceive it for instance some one dreams that himself or one of his will die or that he sees his own figure or that of another person before him or in a coffin or that he hears some one knocking on it to nail him in that he preceives some one to take him by the hand or to strike him on the shoulder and all other things of this nature but in the same degree as those beforementioned without going farther that is to say in things that concern our selves and those that belong to us and in respect of what is natural not with persons that have no communication with us or concerning things that are wholly contingent and casual and that depend on the choice of mens wills if beyond this somewhat often happens it is not against nature nor above it nor out of its power for before such a dream happens a man has thought perhaps more than once with great affliction of his death since a dream comes from much thinking on a thing and that the affliction partly causes the distemper or having increased it death naturally follows but it is more difficult to comprehend how this may also happen in respect of other persons for a man has not so strong a tie with another mean while as i observe that naturalists assigns two causes that give birth to sympathy or a mutual inclination which manifestly appears in men beasts plants trees and in many other bodies by which they naturally unite themselves together or keep far asunder from each other and in their operations they find not reason to reject as incredible even these apparitions in a dream but we ought also to conclude from thence that the natural cause being thus known the devil has nothing to do in it  we explain more particularly sympaphy after the way following we say then first that each body even though so little it can scarce be perceived is composed of an infinity of little parts and that these little parts are interwoven the one with the other after a very unequal manner that it is for this that two bodies whereof the least parts or atoms are woven after an equal manner have also a tie one with the other for they are invested with an object which is the same or at least of the same nature and of an equal manner wherefore those which are of an equal composition of parts will receive the one as well as the other after such or such a manner a like desire or like food in eating and drinking and as this texture has place particularly in the naturnal mixture of mans body we call this equality of humors and according then as these particles agree and are woven and disposed well or ill together this is called good or ill humor of a man but this is not yet all the particles thus interlact for the composition of a body are withal little volatile parts which pass away in vapors continually both outwardly and inwardly whereof we may see as far as the eye can discover some what a proof in the smoke or vapor of hot blood for this vapor is naught but a quantity of those little parts mixed the one with the other in a volatile and continual motion these particles exhale from one body into another now in all things this holds that every where like seeks its like and joins with its like when in the commerce of humane life this does not happen so exteriourly it is because this coupling or joining is not made by a necessity of nature but by deliberation and nevertheless there will be still a scet cause in the sympathy of these nature which  not appear so outwardly  we must add to what we have said before the force of the imagination whereof expeperience teaches us amazing thinks it is to speak thus as openly as we may as out of the operation of the exterior senses that spirits that is to say the said exhalation and evaporation of the most subtle parts mounting from the heart to the brain where they expose a like representation as that of the common sense of man by the means of the senses but otherwise brought from without according then as the brain is tender or hard moist or dry or that a person is old or young a man or a woman that the one or the other finds himself sick or in health according to all this i say something is imprinted more easily or more difficulty in the brain the spirits having more or less communication with those of another body equal to this by the means of the exhalation and evaporation of the least parts outwardly and inwardly this happens most commonly in a sickness and above all in a mortality thence comes the contagion of the air and of the blood this being so men may also in case of a sickness or mortality or of some iminent danger while the blood and spirits are particularly moved have a lively foreperceiving that is to say the woman in respect of her husband the child in regard of his mother and the mother in regard of her child brothers and sisters in regard the one of the other and even a friend and a comrade in respect of those with whom they have contracted a friendship and society and though they are far distant they cease not to have this foreperceiving since the volatile particles disperse themselves to many leagues distance and tend the one toward the other  experience wholly proves what i say the most subtle parts and their exterior and interriour attraction of one body in another causes that the loadstone draws the iron for what draws reciprocally touches this touch fortifies the texture of the particles the one with the others and so that what does not touch reciprocally does not draw that these little parts disperse themselves very far is what is taught us by the trace of a dog this beast in following it will find by the sole means of the smell in which consists the motion of these subtle parts the tract of any one that has traveled to fifty nay even to an hundred leagues of way by land and water in fair weather and tempestuous as for the imagination its a thing manifest by the wonderful experience and operation it has while women are with child on the fruit without speaking at present of other examples which may find their place in the sequel  i conclude therefore at present that this communication and this motion of the volatile parts of the bodies of persons that have love the one for the others or that are of a very equal nature be it far or near produces such a thing this admirable participation makes an equal impression on the brain as we find ill weather causes it self to be foreperceivd in a mans limbs or chiefly in those of a beast i say such an impression is made when there i a person sick or that a sickness foments it self in his limbs or that he dies or is on the point of death its to this person as a dream he understands he sees he prceives something and this also troubles him when there has happened to him after an extraordinary manner such a perception or dream waking it is the same thing as the imaginations that never happened to him after the same manner or near it or that he has been used all the times he has made this experience to see somewhat like this to follow he may take it for a sign not of a devil or of a spirit but as being wholly natural we may also freely believe that by reason of the unequal constitution of the brain blood and spirits in some men one also ought to be subject more to these kinds of rencounters than another this causes that we may say in some manner with reason that one man may see more fantoms than another  i shall forbear to incert more here from dr bekker referring the reader to his works and i shall conclude this chapter with a relation or two for men to consider how dr bekkers philosophy before laid down may serve to explain them though in truth these relations might have been somewhat more properly inserted in some precedent chapter than this of dreams  the first is concerning that duke of buckingham who was stabbed by felton aug          mr illy the astrologer in his book entitled monarchy or no monarchy in england printed in  0      having mentioned the death of the duke of buckingham writes as follows since i am upon the death of buckingham i shall relate a true story of his being admonished often of the death he should die in this manner  an aged gentleman one parker as i now remember having formerly belonged unto the duke or of great acquaintance with the dukes father and now retired had a demon appeared several times to him in the shape of sir george villiers the dukes father this demon walked many times in parkers bedchamber without any action of terror noise hurt or speech but at last one night broke out in these words mr parker i know you loved me formerly and my son george at this time very well i would have you go from me you know me very well to be his father old sir george villiers of leicestershire and to acquaint him with these and these particulars etc and that he above all refrain the council and company of such and such whom he then nominated or else he will come to destruction and that suddenly parker though a very discreet man partly imagined himself in a dream all this time and being unwilling to proceed upon no better grounds forbore addressing himself to the duke for he conceived if he should acquaint the duke with the words of his father and the manner of his appearance to him such apparitions being not usual he should be laughed at and thought to dote in regard he was aged some few nights past without farther trouble to the old man but not very many nights after old sir george villiers appeard again walked quick and furiously in the room seemed angry with parker and at last said mr parker i thought you had been my friend so much and loved my son george so well that you would have acquainted him with what i desired but i know you have not done it by all the friendship that ever was betwixt you and me and the great respect you bear my son i desire you to deliver what i formerly commanded you to my son the old man seeing himself thus solicited promised the demon he would but first argued it thus that the duke was not easy to be spoken withal and that he would account him a vain man to come with such a message from the dead nor did he conceive the duke would give any credit to him to which the demon thus answered if he will not believe you have this discourse from me tell him of such a secret and named it which he knows none in the world ever knew but my self and him mr parker being now well satisfied that he was not asleep and that the apparition was not a vain delusion took a fit opportunity and seriously acquainted the duke with his fathers words and the manner of his apparition the duke heartily laughed at the relation which put old parker to a stand but at last he assumed courage and told the duke that he acquainted his fathers ghost with what he found now to be true viz scorn and derision but my lord says he your father bid me acquaint you by this token and he said it was such as none in the world but your  selves did yet know hereat the duke was amazed and much astonished but took no warning or notice thereof keeping the same company still advising with such counselors and performing such actions as his father by parker countermanded shortly after old sir george villiers in a very quiet but sorrowful posture appears again to parker and said mr parker i know you delivered my words to george my son i thank you for so doing  h ighted them and now i only request this more at your hands that once again you repair to my son and tell him that if he will not amend and follow the counsel i have given him this knife or dagger and with that he pulled a knife or dagger from under his gown shall end him and do you mr parker set your house in order for you shall die at such a time mr parker once more engaged though very unwillingly to acquaint the duke with this last message and so did but the duke desired him to trouble him no farther with such messages and dreams and told him he perceived he was now an old man and doted and within a month after meeting mr parker on lambethbridge said now mr parker what say you of your dream who only returned sir i wish it may never have success etc but within six weeks after he was stabbed with a knife according to his fathers admonition beforehand and mr parker died soon after he had seen the dream or vision performed  this relation is inserted also in the lord clarendons history and in sir richard bakers chronicle the lord clarendon in his history vol i l   having given some relations says that amongst others there was one meaning this of paker which was upon a better foundation of credit than usually such discourses are founded upon and he tells us that parker was an officer in the kings wardrobe in windsor castle of a good reputation for honesty and discretion and then about the age of fifty years or more this man had in his youth been bred in a school in the parish where sir george villiers the father of the duke lived and had been much cherished and obliged in that season of his age by the said sir george whom afterward he never saw about six months before the miserable end of the duke of buckingham the apparition was seen after the third appearance he made a journey to london where the court then was he was very well known to sir ralph freeman one of the masters of requests who had married a lady that was near allied to the duke and was himself well received by him he informed the duke with the reputation and honesty of the man and sir ralph freeman carried the man the next morning by five a clock to lambeth according to the dukes appointment and there presented him to the duke who received him courteously at his landing and walked in conference near an hour with him and sir ralphs and the dukes servants at such a distance that they heard not a word but sir ralph always fixed his eyes on the duke who sometimes spoke with great commotion and disorder and that the man told sir ralph in their return over the water that when he mentioned those particulars that were to gain him credit the dukes color changed and he swore he could come to that knowledge only by the devil for that those particulars were known only to himself and to one person more who he was sure would never speak of them so far the lord clarendon and i think dr bekkers hypothesis will hardly clear this matter  i shall only add here a small relation of a thing that happened to my self about six years since a gentleman whom i had never seen nor heard of before came to my lodgig which was then in fetterlane about six of the clock in the morning it being summer time he found a servant of the house and asked him whether i were stirring and finding not he desired the servant to go to me and acquaint me of his being there and that he desired if it might not be troublesome he might be admitted to my bedside i admitted it and upon his coming to me he told me he was directed to me by a lady a relation of mine whom he had met at hamstead he having a desire to discourse with me concerning an affair in which he understood i had some knowledge after some discourse was over i asked him his name which he told me then i asked him where he lived he replied in canewood whereupon i was somewhat surprised for that very morning at three of the clock i was awaked out of my sleep by a loud voice saying cane cane cane now whether the intentness of the gentlemans thought of coming to me wrought this upon my mind or how else it came to pass may require consideration  chap x what perception men have had of genii or spirits and their operations by magical practices the learned ludovicus capellus writ a book entitled the hinge of faith and religion which was published in english an    0 in the tenth chapter of that book he draws a reason to prove a deity from wizards magicians inchanters and from all the heathen idolatry and superstition where he writes thus  it is a certain thing which the experience of our days and that of all ages does averr which the monuments of histories both ancient and modern confirm and which the writings as well of heathens as of christians certify that there are and have been at all times in the world witches magicians diviners inchanters and such like notorious wicked people that have a familiar communication and a frequent commerce with devils by whose help and power they do many strange and prodigious things above and beyond all humane wisdom all which consequently infers that these things proceed from a supernatural and immaterial cause such as demons are  the laws made and promulgated in all well governed states and commonwealths as well that of the jews by moses as that of the christians and of the heathens themselves do evidence this to us the executions and supplices which justice frequently inflicts on such persons the processes the relations and informations that are made about them do assure us of this and leave no doubt of it the damnable curiosity of many persons which every day have recourse to such as they to know see and do all those things that cannot be done by any other means does also confirm this the writings of the heathens as well greeks as romans are full of instances of such persons and of their effects which are stupendous and wonderful so that a man must wholly renounce his reason and believe nothing of those things that are done if he will not also believe that there are such persons which is true and manifest by all those kinds of testimonies and monuments which may induce us to believe any thing  now if there are any witches inchanters etc it necessarily follows that there are demons by whose help and power they cause these prodigious effects to come to pass which men wonder at and look upon with horror and amazement it being not possible that those things should be done by any humane power the histories therefore and writings of all nations and even of the heathens themselves are full of examples of the devils apparitions and of their strange effects now he says if there ware any demons as it cannot be denied it follows that there is a deity above them which so restrains them that they shall not overthrow all things by their might for they have strength and malice enough to do it  he adds beneath the public profession of magical arts which has been sometime tolerated in some of the most famous universities of christendom the common distinction of black and white magic which has been invented by some excellent philosophers of the sects of plato and pythagoras who would have found a way by which they might have subjected the good demons to them and reconcile them to themselves and which has from them past to the jewish cabalists and from them to the christians are an invincible argument that there are magicians and demons the certain and averred relations of the northern countries and of both the indies do testify that all those do swarm with them and that there is scarce one which has not his demon and familiar spirit so far capellus  to give some account now of the magic and communion with spirits practiced in the northern countries shefferus professor of law at upsal in sweden has writ an history of lapland which was printed in english at oxford an      and in his eleventh chapter which is concerning the magical ceremonies of the laplanders he writes as follows  it has been the received opinion among all that have known the name of the laplanders that they are a people addicted to magic this judgment of historians concerning the laplanders is no less verified of the biarmi their predecessors so that we may justly suppose both of them to have descended from the same original for the biarmi were so expert in these arts that they could either by their looks words or some other wicked artifice so ensnare and bewitch men as to deprive them of the use of limbs and reason and very often to bring them into extreme danger of their lives but though in these latter times they do not so frequently practice this and dare not profess it so publicly as before yet there are still many that give themselves wholly to this study for every one thinks it the surest way to defend himself from the injuries and malicious designs of others and they commonly profess that their knowledge of these things is absolutely necessary for their own security upon which account they have teachers and professors in this science and parents in their last wills bequeath to their children as the greatest part of their estate those spirits and devils that have been any way serviceable to them in their life time and sturlsonius gives an account of the most famous laplanders of that profession and though some arrive at a greater knowledge in this profession and are more able masters to teach it than others yet it is very seldom but the parents themselves are so learned as to perform the duty and save the expenses of a tutor according to an aptness of disposition in learning some arrive at a greater perfection in this art than others who may be excellently qualified for other employments  as to their bequeathing their familiars to their children they suppose it the only means to raise their family so that they excel one another in this art according to the largeness of the legacies they receive thus each house has its peculiar spirits and of different and quite contrary natures from those of others and not only each distinct family but single persons in them also have their peculiar spirits sometimes one two or more according as they intend to stand on the defensive part or are maliciously inclined and design to be upon the offensive but there is a set number of obsequious spirits beyond which no one has and some of these will not engage themselves without great solicitation and earnest entreaties when others readily proffer themselves to little children when they find them fit for their turn so that diverse of the inhabitants are almost naturally magicians for when the devil takes a liking to any person in his infancy as a fit instrument for his designs he presently seizes on him with a disease in which he haunts him with several apparitions from whence according to the capacity of his years and understanding he learns what belongs to the art those which are taken thus a second time see more visions and gain greater knowledge if they are seized a third time which is seldom without great torment or utmost danger of their life the devil appears to them in all his shapes by which they arrive to the very perfection of this art and become so knowing that without the drum they can see things at great distances and are so possessed by the devil that they see them even against their will for instance not long since a certain lap who is yet alive upon my complaining against him for his drum brought it to me and confessed with tears that though he should part with it and not make him another he should have the same visions he had formerly and he instanced in my self giving me a true and particular relation of whatever had happened to me in my journey to lapland and he farther complained that he knew not how to make use of his eyes since things altogether distant were present to him  as for their magic art it is according to the diversity of instruments they make use of in it divided into two parts one comprehends all that to which their drum belongs the other those things to which knots darts spells conjurations and the like refer concerning their drum it is made of an hollow piece of wood and must be either of pine fur or birchtree which grows in such a particular place and turns directly according to the suns course which is when the grain of the wood turning from the bottom to the top of the tree winds it self from the right hand to the left from this perhaps they believe the tree very acceptable to the sun which under the image of thor they worship with all imaginable adoration the piece of wood they make it of is the root cleft asunder and made hollow on one side upon which they stretch a skin the other side being unequal is the lower part in which they make two holes where they put their fingers to hold it the shape of the upper side is oval and in diameter about half an ell it is like a kettledrum but not altogether so round nor so hollow and the skin is fastened with wooden pegs some are sewed with the sinews of rain dear they paint upon the skin several pictures in red stained with the bark of an aldertree as for the particular pictures of these drums i refer you to the author they put a bunch of brass rings on the drum when they beat them several of the drums have not the same pictures upon them they have the pictures of several animals on their drums to signify when and in what place they may find them if a rain dear be lost how they may get him again whether the rain dears young ones will live whether their fishing will be successful if sick men will recover or not whether women great with child shall have a safe delivery or such or such a man shall die of such a distemper or of what other and other things of the like nature which they are desirous to know he says he can give no account of the reason for the difference in their drums unless it be that some of them are made for more malicious designs others again for each mans private purpose on this account he believes according to the nature of the business they intend they add and blot out and sometimes wholly change the figures  there are two things required to fit a drum for use an index and an hammer the first shows among the pictures that thing they enquire after with the hammer they beat the drum the index is the bunch of brass rings before mentioned they first place one great ring upon the drum then they hang several small ones upon that the shape of the index is very different he had one of copper of the bigness of a dollar with a square hole in the middle and several small chains hanging about it instead of rings another has an alchimyring on which a small round plate of copper is hang by little chains he had seen another of bone in shape of the greek d with rings above it and others of a quite different make as he has given here cutts of several drums so he has of the indexes and rings some writers call those rings serpents or brazen frogs and toads not that they resemble them but because by them they signify these creatures whose pictures they often make use of in their conjuring as supposing them very grateful and acceptable to the devil they make the index indifferently of any sort of metal the hammer they use in raising their familiars as for the head of it it is made of raindears horn the other part serves for the handle and he has given us two cuts of the hammers with this hammer they beat the drum not so much to make a noise as by drumming to move the ring lying on the skin so as to pass over the pictures and show what they seek after this is the description of the drum with all its necessaries as it is used by the laplanders that are subject to sweden the finlaps also that are under the crown of denmark make use of drums though somewhat different in their make from the former however he conceives them not of a different kind but made for some particular uses the laplanders use their drums for diverse designs and are of opinion that what ever they do is done by the help of it and therefore they keep it very choicly with the index and hammer  there are three very strange things which they believe they can effect by their drum and these belonging either to their hunting their sacred affairs or lastly their enquiring into things far distant he finds four things chiefly mentioned by another writer the first  the knowing the state of affairs in foreign countries the second what success their designs in hand will meet with the third how to cure diseases the fourth what sacrifices their gods will be pleased to accept and what beast each god desires or dislikes most the artists that beat the drums beat not altogether in the same place but round about the index they beat softly at first presently quicker and continue this till they have effected their intent the drummer first lifts up the drum by degrees then beats softly about the index till it begins to stir and when it is removed some distance from its first place to either side he strikes harder till the index point at something from whence he may collect what he looked for both the drummer and those present are upon their knees those who desire to know the condition of their friends or affairs abroad whether  00 or  000 miles distant go to some laplander or finlander skilful in this art and present him with a linen garment or piece of silver as his reward an example of this nature is to be seen upon record at bergen in norway where the effects of the german masters are registered  in this place one john delling a factor to a german enquired of a finlapper of norway about his master in germany the finlapper readily assented to tell him like a drunken man he presently made a bawling then reeling and dancing about several times in a circle fell at last upon the ground lying there for some time as if he were dead then starting up on a sudden related to him all things concerning his master which were afterward found to agree to what he reported a laplander also as schefferus writes gave tornaeus an account of the journey he first made to lapland though he never had seen him before that time which though it were true tornaeus dissembled to him lest he might glory too much in his devilish practices schefferus says the authority of this man is so considerable that it may give credit enough to the story  as to the method taken in making these discoveries its very different hist goth l   c    olaus magnus describes it thus the drummer goes into some private room accompanied by one single person beside his wife and beating the drum moves the index about muttering at the same time several charms then presently he falls into an ecstasy and lies for a short time as dead mean while his company takes great care that no gnat fly or other animal touch him for his soul is carried by some evil genius into a foreign country from which it is brought back with some sign as a knife or ring as a token of his knowledge of what is done in those parts after this rising up he relates all the circumstances belonging to the business that was enquired after petrus claudius makes no mention either of the drum charms company or those things he brings with him but he says he casts himself on the ground grows black in his face lying as if dead for an hour or two according as the distance of the place is of which he makes enquiry when he awakes he gives a full account of all affairs there samuel rheen in his history says the drummer sings a song called by them joiike and the men and women that are present sing likewise some in higher some in lower notes this they call duura as for their casting themsel on the ground in a trance and what  sa by some of their souls parting from their bodies schefferus believes the devil only then stifles the faculties of the soul for a time and hinders their operations as the drummer falls down he lays the drum as near as possible on his head those in the mean time that are present leave not off singing all the while he lies sweating in his agony which they do not only to put him in mind when he awakes of the business he was to know but also that he might recover out of his trance which he would never do as they imagine if they either ceased singing or any one stirred with their hand or foot and this perhaps is the reason why they suffer no fly nor any living creature to touch him and watch him so diligently it is uncertain how long they may lie in their trance but it is commonly according as the place where they make their discovery is nearer or farther of but the time never exceeds    hours let the place be at never so far a distance as for their farther practice with the drum i refer you to the book it self  concerning their other parts of magic the first is a cord tied with knots for raising of wind schefferus says he thinks it not at all probable that the laplanders should be concerned in this practice since they live in an inland country bordering no where upon the sea wherefore this properly belongs to the finlappers of norway and those that are skilled in this art have command chiefly over the winds thn blew at their birth now he says as this belongs chiefly to the finlappers and finlanders of norway so does the stopping of the course of ships which is altogether of the same nature  somewhat relating to this i find in nicolaus hemmingius who in his tract de superstitionibus magicis printed at copenhaguen an      tells us that petrus palladius sometime bishop of seelandt and professor of divinity at cphaguen could from a part of his body affected foretell from what part of the heavens tempests would come and was seldom deceived  next he comes to their magical darts which they make of lead in length about a finger by these they execute their revenge on their enemies and wound them with cancerous swellings either in the arms or legs which by the extremity of its pain kills them in three days time they shoot these darts to what distance they please and seldom miss their aim schefferus thinks that both olaus magnus who writes this and zeigler from whom he transcribed it as he has many other things are mistaken in setting down leaden darts since he finds no person now that knows any such thing nor is there any mention made of such in any other writers he thinks the mistake may be by misunderstanding the word skot which is commonly used for explaining those darts for when man or beast is suddenly taken with a disease people call this that takes them so skot that is a dart petrus claudius calls it a began which they send abroad he likens it to a fly but says its some little devil of which the finlanders in norway that excel most in this art keep great numbers in a leather bag and dispatch daily some of them abroad but he seems to intimate no more by this word began than that very thing which endangers mens health and lives for he says that these finlanders cannot live peaceably except they let out of their ganeska or gankiid which is the satchel every day one of the gans that is a fly or devil but if the began can find no man to destroy after they have sent him out which they seldom do upon no account at all then he roves about at a venture and destroys the first thing he meets with therefore this word began signifies no more than what zeigler meant by his dart for the term by which they express going out is de skiuda devis began that is he as it were shoots out his began like an arrow for skiuda is only proper to the shooting out of an arrow  this magical practice they use as well against one another as strangers nay sometimes against those that they know are equals in the art some of the conjurers are contented only with the power to expel the began out of men or beasts which others send this is remarkable among them that they can hurt no man with their began except they first know his parents name  now all that the finlanders and finlappers of norway effect by their began the laplanders do by a thing they call tire this tire is a round ball about the bigness of a wallnut or small apple made of the finest hair of a beast or else of moss very smooth and so light that it seems hollow its color is a mixture of yellow green and ash but so that the yellow appears most this tire they say is quickened and moved by a particular art its sold by the laplanders so that he that buys it may hurt whom he pleases with it they persuade themselves and others that by the tire they can send either serpents toads mice or what they please into any man to make his torment the greater it goes like a whirlwind and as swift as an arrow and destroys the first man or beast that it lights on but so that it often mistakes of these we have two many instances at this time which are too long to insert here so far schefferus  there are two things i shall note in reference to this account of schefferus   as for parents bequeathing to their children their spirits at their deaths we find in the tryls of witches in england that the same has been practiced here and that some have had spirits given them by their parents others by other relations and other friends beside those which originally came to themselves    as for schefferuss particular opinion that the laplanders did not really send darts to those they had a mind to destroy i cannot easily agree in opinion with him for you find before in mr mathers account of the indians in marthas vineyard in new england that the indian pawaws were wont to form a piece of leather like an arrows head and then to tie an hair to it and over these to use some magical ceremonies whereupon the demon presently snatched them away and conveyed them into the bodies of persons to be afflicted and as the laplanders send their gans or flies to destroy persons so mr mather says sometimes the demon pretends to the pawaws that he brings a portion of the spirit of a person closely imprisoned in a fly and as they deal with the fly so it fares with the body of the person they intend to afflict the drums also used by the laplanders are used by the westindians so that there is a strange agreement in their magical practices as i shall set forth beneath  chap  0 the learned olaus rudbeck in the second volume of his atlantica treats concerning the lapland drums the heads of which he says are divided into three parts the uppermost region contains the heavens and all celestial things and all volatiles the middle region contains the earth with men and all animals the lowermost region contains all infernals and subteraneous places and then he gives a particular explication of all the figures or marks on the tympana and says if the laplanders would know whether when they go a hunting they shall have success they beat their drum with thors hammer and diligently observe a certain ring leaping on the drum which if they see to rest on the image of a ranger they no way doubt but they shall kill a ranger that day if it rests on the figure of a wolf they conclude they shall have a wolf for their prey he refers us for other things relating to the use of the lapland drums to schefferuss lapponia olaus magnus and others however i shall give you here what seems to be olaus rudbecks sense concerning what may be expected from the superstitious use of the lapland drums inserted by him in the fifth chapter of the said book p     it is as follows since the doctrine of christ came to lapland men could not but forget many things relating to superstition and cast off others or at least be at an uncertainty in them whether therefore the laplanders themselves are now ignorant of the true make of the most ancient drums or whether the very differing fitting of the drums deprives them of the knowledge of a thing so extremely vain they now suffer themselves with extreme difficulty to be drawn to make known their superstition to others perhaps also shame or fear deters some to pass by that the chief arcanum of superstition will not be revealed be it as it may you shall now hardly find any man who knows rightly how to manage this drum or to explain it to others and those who think they know somewhat of this kind either so obstinately conceal it or so dissemble their skill that those labor in a manner in vain who with any gifts how great soever or high drinking which is wont to go a great way with them otherwise endeavor to break or conquer that silence but among gifts if any man will purchase this art of them the laplanders are earnest lovers of imperial rixdollars  in the sixth chapter of his said second volume he tells us of wonderful performances said to have been wrought by the means of their scipio runicus or runstaffe by us called the runick almanac of which there are many in england being anointed with a certain magical ointment viz of mens flying in the air on it and the like and says a more constant fame of nothing has remained in their country from the remotest times of paganism than of such flights in the air and that nothing is more readily believed than that the present laplanders who continue still in paganism use the same kind of flights now and that beside runstaffs sticks pales calves horses dogs and other living creatures anointed with the same kind of ointment were thought to be able to carry their riders to places designed and these things were wont to be ascribed to diana or disa as the first inventress of them  he here tells us also that the tympanum of the mother of the gods so much celebrated by the greeks and latin writers though explained by none of them as it ought was nothing but a copy of the lapland tympanum conveyed to foreign parts by disa isis idaea or diana whose ring and hammer were sometime found in the left hand of the figure of isis at rome the tympanum it self being over the head of the goddess and there being marks under her feet like to those that are seen in the lapland drums the egyptian isis also according to a cut given of her by pignorius holds this ring and hammer in her left hand and the mother of the gods as du choul has set forth handles a tympanum and he says he will make out in his chronology that isis the daughter of inachus going into egypt a little before the times of moses taught the egyptians incantations and withal showed them that infamous use of the hieroglyphical marks with which art the egyptian magi afterward contended with moses before pharaoh but he does not think that all the goths were given to those arts because the testimonies of the slds and of snorro himself free the most valiant of the goths from that infamy those arts being beneath their valor and dignity and seemed much to prejudice the fame and renown due to valiant men and therefore great punishments was never inflicted on men given to such arts by magnanimous kings  i must here note that notwithstanding all this discourse concerning thors hammer and its being conveyed from sweden to foreign parts given us by the learned rudbeck i must wholly yield to what the learned kircher in his obeliscus pamphilius has delivered us concerning it he has there writ a paragraph with this title to it concerning the tautick character or the cross with an hndle to it that is a ring annexed to the top of it the chief of all the hierogliphicks this being the same with what rudbeck calls thors hammer  kircher there among other curious things tells us that the egyptians in the character t tau as in a lookingglass placed the idea of the whole pantomorphous nature by the circle or ring which they commonly place on the top of it they denoted the celestial orbs in which the spirit of the world mixes it self first communicating its virtue to them by the cross the virtue of the four elements on the sublunary world through the mediation of the celestial bodies from which the generation of all things arises for they observed there were two motions chiefly appearing in nature viz a strait and a circular one they represented this by a circle the other by strait lines for the elements being moved out of their natural places they found by experience they returned to them but by strait lines and beneath he quotes the following passage from ficinuss third book de vita caelestus comparenda  the agyptians preferred the figure of the cross before all others because bodies ct by the virtue diffused to the superficies now the first superficies is described by the cross for so it has chiefly longitude and latitude and this is the first figure and the straitest of all and contains four strait angles now the effects of the celestial bodies chiefly result from the rectitude of the rays and angles for then stars are most powerful when they hold the four angles of heaven viz the points of the east and west and of the mid heaven on either side and being so disposed they so cast their rays against each other that they thence make a cross the ancients therefore said the cross was a figure made of the fortitude of the stars and the suscepticle of their fortitude and therefore it had a mighty power in images and received the powers of the spirits and planets  tm   part   p     the same author in his oedipus egypt says the crux ansata or isiaca is seen carried almost in every images hand of the egyptians which character they had in so great veneration that they thought nothing could be rightly done without it and it was the most powerful amulet and a character made by a wonderful subtlety of wit according to the pattern of nature the only guide and light to show the way to happiness  ib tom   p     again he tells us elsewhere that by the crux ansata which consisted of a circle and a cross they denoted the motion of phtha viz the soul of the world artificially disposing all things that are in the world and by the circle the circular motion of the celestial bodies whereby it in some sort animates them and renders them apt for influencing inferiors and by the cross or the lines cutting each other they signify the motion which it performs in the inferior world for the generation and production of things according to the nature of elementary bodies for the motion of sublunary things is according to strait lines as it appears in the motion of light and heavy things and of such as are of a middle nature whereof those being carried some upwards some downwards according to strait lines these participating equally of gravity and levity having got a middle nature and diffused as it were on the sides appositely express the cut lines of a cross and therefore by this only character for the said reasons they do not unmeetly denote the whole process of nature wherefore also they reputed this character as the most mysterious of all hierogliphicks and thought the same had the greatest force of all both to allure good genii and facinate the evil ones hence calling it the symbol of health the greatest spell the monogram phtha and by other names they had it put in all obelisks statues tables etc  here we find a pretty satisfactory account of the original institution of this character which i cannot find in the the works of the learned rudbeck and therefore as far as it appears to me hitherto i must conclude it of an egyptian original  to proceed now to some further account from olaus rudbeck in reference to magical practices in his   d vol     he tells us when we find any strange relation in that kind we ought duly to weigh what is really performed by the magic art and what contains some abstruse sense and is proposed translatitiously and by way of aenigma he says it is a firm argument with him for the practice of witchcraft and horrible magic in the north that men came thither at the same time from greece egypt and phaenicia as to a famous academy and gave themselves over wholly to the study of those arts and that pythagoras was not the only man that learnt to fly of the hyperborean abaris but others of the same age as we find from diogenes in photius viz carmanus cylla dercyllis etc who thinking themselves in thule on a sudden awaking as it were from a dream found themselves in the temple of hercules at tire and the author setting down some of their chief customs agreeing with what the greeks and latins write tells us that the golden apples raising the gods themselves from death to life that is which set forth the acts of their ancestors encouragements to virtue and determents from vice are interpreted by him letters which were cut on stones or wood or writ on parchment and those stones tables parchments and lapland tympana from their oblong figure got the name of pineapples apples and eggs and those letters which were writ on parchment or magical tampana were done over with a gold color drawn from the bark of an alder which alder was much esteemed by their ancestors and is now by the laplanders because from its inward bark chewed with the teeth they get that gold color wherewith they paint all kinds of letters and figures on their tympana and as for its being said that some descended into hell being carried on alder sticks it is on this account that in their divinations they used such sticks in the barks of which letters and circles were cut compassing about the stick like the various spires of serpents as for the god they call upon in their divinations he says its saturn and his worshippers using the drums are called saturnines therefore he that by the help of the drum would seek counsel of the gods takes in one hand a golden apple in the other an hammer made like a cross of alder or horn and has also a serpent made of copper and not much differing from gold in color which upon the beat of the hammer on the head of the drum leaps in and out till it settles on some letter or figure showing that to be it from whence the answer is given moreover the saturnine upon beating the drum a while fell into a trance as though he were dead and the laplanders by mistake then thought the soul went out of the body and after having learnt many things returned again whereas their ancestors with plutarch thought the soul did not go out of the body but yielded for some time and gave a loose to the genius which having roved about told it inwardly many things which it had seen and heard without now the things they desire to see are of various kinds either the soul of the dead or the actions of men at a great distance or past or future things and he gives instances of some eminent persons who came from other countries to theirs to see the ghosts of their ancestors raised after this manner and plato owns that all the tradition concerning the elisian fields and hell owes its rise to their north which being cut on a table of brass was carried by ops from the hyprbreans to delos belonging to the greeks  in his tenth chapter of his said third vol speaking of their cumae which lies beyond the baltic over against phlaegra he says it was known formerly for horrible magic and the imposture of witches where ulysses and aneas were seduced consulting the old fatetelling cumaean sibyl called the prophetess of hell because she lived in the remotest part north as it were in a subteraneous place this sibyl being different from the cumane sibyl in italy nay and he here tells us it is to be noted that whatsoever of the magic art and natural science is ascribed to the antediluvian giants by syncellus and others all this both the greek histories and those of their country unanimously ascribe to the north  in his twelfth chapter of the same volume he tells us that thor amongst other names given him was called flugeguden the god of flies driving away magical flies with his hammer he being the same with beelzebub mentioned in the scripture  as for the magical flies they were demons in the shape of blue flies which the finlanders kept in a magical pouch or satchel they being called by them began that is spirits which they daily sent forth for their magical purposes viz to bring them news from all parts of the universe and to do things destructive to men etc and these flies were driven away by sacrifices to thor though the victims offered by the jews at the temple of jerusalem were freed from flies by reason of the jews faith in god  i thought fit to subjoyn this account from olaus rudbeck to that of schefferus they both relating to magical practices and giving some light to each other  i may here acquaint the reader that olaus rudbeck son to the famous olaus before quoted was deputed anno      by the late king of sweden charles xi to travel through the northern provinces of sweden viz lapland finland etc to write a natural history of them giving an account of things peculiar to those countries viz the plants and flowers stones metals quadrupes birds fish etc and anno   0  he printed a first part of this intended account at upsal in quarto the general title of the work being lapponia illustrata and the particular title of this first part being iter per uplandiam in his general title page he says he shall set forth in his work the situation of each of the countries he there names and the genius of the inhabitants but chiefly both the habit of body and disposition of mind of the laplanders their religion manners language way of converse and their first origin beside the account of their annimals minerals mountains woods lakes rivers cataracts etc so that as he designs to divide this work into several parts we may hope in one of them to have as accurate an account as may be of their magical practices and superstitions  having intimated before the magical use of drums with other superstitious practices in the west indies i shall give you here what mr wafer in his description of the isthmus of darien printed anno      writes of it which is thus we inquired of the indians when they expected any ships who said they knew not but would enquire concerning it and thereupon sent for some of their pawaws or conjurers who came and went into an apartment by themselves stayed for some time at their exercise and he and his companions could hear them make most hideous yellings and shrieks imitating the voices of all their birds and beasts with their own noise they joined that of several stones struck together and of conchshells and of a sort of drums made of hollow bamboes which they beat upon making also a jarring noise with strings fastened to the larger bones of beasts and every now and then they would make a dreadful exclamation and clattering all of a sudden and as suddenly make a pause with a profound silence but finding that after a considerable time no answer was made them they concluded that twas because we were in the house and so turned us out and went to work again but still finding no return after an hour or two more they made a search in our apartment and finding some of our clothes hanging up in a basket against the wall they threw them out of doors in a great disdain then they fell once more to their pawawing and after a little time they came out with their answer but all in a muck sweat so they first went down to the river and washed themselves and then came and delivered the oracle to us which was to this effect that from the tenth day from that time there would arrive two ships and that in the morning of the tenth day we should hear first one gun and some time after another that one of us should die soon after at that going aboard we should lose one of our guns all which things fell out exactly according to the prediction  a person who has spent many years in voyages has also told me that he has seen drums used in america particularly at dominico where the indians use them to pawaw with for causing rain or fair weather but those drums have no characters on them they beat them with sticks and have some little piece of iron or stone on the head loose which plays while they are beating they utter also many words all the while they are beating and speak very loud the same person acquainted me that he saw in norway near yarpin an artist beat a drum like a lapland drum with two sticks and he observed his lips to move all the while he beat thereon above a quarter of an hour till he was all in a sweat and then he fell into a trance in which he lay above half an hour or near three quarters and upon his coming to himself he answered the question had been proposed to him  concerning these diabolical ecstasies mr pereaud in the seventh chapter of his demonology prefixed to his antidaemon of mascon printed in french at geneva an      writes thus the devil causes witches sometimes to fall into ecstasies in the daytime causing in their bodies a destruction of their spirits and sense for some time so that a man would say their soul were out of their body and then he puts lively impressions of things into them while they are in this preternatual sleep their souls being as it were retreated into themselves and so fixed by the devil to the fancies and illusions wherewith he amuses them that they firmly believe by this imagination thus lively impressed that they have done themselves what the devil represented to them by such imaginations there are many histories of these diabolical ecstasies but i shall content my self in alleging one and so much the rather because it happened in my time in the country of vaux about the year      as i have been assured by very credible persons there was at that time and in that place a bailiff of berne who having one day invited the minister of the said place to dinner and being at table they came to a discourse of witches occasioned by the then confinement of one as a prisoner in the castle of echalens where they were and which prisoner was already condemned to die for the crime of witchcraft and was in a short time to be executed as he really was this bailiff spoke his mind freely to the minister his pastor concerning many things which this witch confessed to have done and which he had a difficulty to believe it possible for him to do and hereupon being risen from table the bailiff went to the prison and brought the prisoner and having spoken to him among other things concerning the confessions he had made and of his condemnation following thereupon he courteously told him that he should consider well whether he had not done himself injury in having confessed things that he had not done minding him of some of those things in particular hereupon the prisoner who was already disposed to die seriously told him that what he had said and confessed was really true and that for proof of this if he pleased to permit him he would kill the cattle of a neighbor whom he named so he had his box and his stick which were at his house in a place which he named hereupon the bailiff willing to satisfy his curiosity resolved to send for this stick and box resolving also to pay for the cattle to whom they belonged the stick and box being brought were put into the witchs hands who in the presence of the bailiff the minister and some others performed all the ceremonies that other witches are wont to use with those instruments of satan till he fell as dead at their feet without any motion or sense till about an hour or three quarters after he came to himself as from death to life or as from a most profound sleep and then being asked by the bailiff whence he came he said he came from killing the cattle which he had mentioned to him and according to the leave he had given him presently the bailiff sent to know whether this were true and the cattle were found really dead as he had said  mr pereaud adds the question is who then killed the cattle it could not be the witch his body continued always in the presence of the bailiff and others to say that he went in his soul separated from the body this cannot be for reasons which he gives it follows then it was the devil himself that did it having wrought in the mean time so powerfully on the imagination of the witch that he believed it was done by himself  paracelsus has another way of explaining these things tom    c   prob in scien divi paragr   which i shall leave to the readers consideration it is as follows the constellation of a man may be so great in its thought that in a mans sleep it may send his sydereal spirit to another place without the aid of the elementary body that astral body has a power of infecting with poison weakening distorting blinding beating killing and inspiring and that in a moment and afterward of returning to its elementary body and its a thing very well known that the ancients through a strong imagination by the force of the astral body attempted and performed many things of this kind against their enemies so that some on a sudden have been rendered paralitical no natural cause concurring some deprived of their sight some made leprous some strangled these and the like evils have been inflicted which could scarce be cured again in a very long time therefore let those physicians who meet with such diseases know that neither the elements nor nature it self breeds them but that they were the works of the sole syderea body of others and these things are caused in dreams when this or that man dreams such a thing therefore according to this dream judge of the disease of others  he adds beneath though the body so and spirit are not together at the same time yet the thought and speculation or imagination remains still in the spirit wherefore they are often seen with such kinds of thoughts since therefore the thought of a man is of such a nature therefore by the sydereal spirit that thing is so expressed and signified by a dream according as one spirit is disposed to another before he be consumed nor is this only so but also in mountains and woody places and in the alps a great number of these sydereal spirits have been sometimes seen which have hurt cattle and other creatures because the sydereal spirits of some maintained an hatred and executed a revenge after death against thse neighbors whose cattle they were  the following relation concerning an admirable performance of persons who cast themselves into a trance is no less stranger  frommannus in his tract de fasciatione magica part   c   quotes miolus writing thus no less admirable is that judgment of seven magicians which i learnt at nantes an     when therefore they had took upon them to tell within a little space what was done ten miles round they presently fell all down as dead and lay so for three hours and then arising they told whatsoever they had seen done in the whole town of nantes and in the country round about it to a good distance the places acts and men being observed all which things upon enquiry were found true therefore all of them being accused and found guilty of many malefices were condemned to the fire  purchase in his extracts from gonzalo ferdiando ovido p   l   c   his summary and general history of the indis writes thus before the inhabitants of hispaniola had received the christian faith there was among them a sect of men who lived solitarily in the dsarts and led their life in silence and abstinence more strictly than the pythagorens abstaining in like manner from all things that lived of blood contented only with fruits herbs and roots which the deserts afforded them  professors of this sect being called pices they applied themselves to the knowledge of natural things and used certain secret magical operations and superstitions whereby they had a familiarity with spirits which they allured into their bodies at such time as they would take upon them to tell of things to come which they did as follows when any of the kings sent for any of them out of the deserts for this purpose the piaces comes with two of his disciples waiting on him of whom one brings with him a vessel of a secret water and the other a little silver bell when he comes to the place he sits down on a round stool made for him on purpose one of his disciples standing on one hand of him and the other on the other in the presence of the king and certain of his chief retinue for the common people are not admitted to these mysteries and turning his face toward the desert he begins his incantations and calls the spirit with a loud voice by certain names which no man understands but himself and his disciples after he has done this a while if the spirit deferrs his coming he drinks of the said water and therewith grows hot and furious and inverts and turns his enchantment and lets himself blood with a thorn strangely turmoiling himself as we read of the furious sibyls not ceasing till the spirit comes who presently overturns him as a greyhound overturns a squiril then for a while he seems to lie as though he were in great pain or in a rapture wonderfully tormenting himself during which agony one of his disciples shakes the silver bell continually when the agony is over and he lies quiet though without any sense or feeling the king or some other in his stead asks of him what he desires to know and the spirit answers him by the mouth of the rapt piaces with a direct and perfect answer to all points on a time a certain spaniard being present at those mysteries with one of the kings and in the spanish tongue asking the piaces concerning certain ships which they looked for out of spain the spirit answered in the indian tongue and told them what day and hour the ship departed from spain how many they were and what they brought without failing in any point if he be asked concerning the eclipse of the sun or moon which they greatly fear and abhor he gives a perfect answer and the like of tempests famine plenty war or peace and such other things when all questions are over his disciples call him aloud ringing the silver bell at his ear and blowing a certain powder into his nostrils whereby he is raised as it were from a dead sleep being yet somewhat heavy headed and faint for a good while after since the christian faith has been dispersed through this island those diabolical practices have ceased  the same author from the fifth book of josphus acasta part   l   c   speaking of the westindians of mexico writes as follows  when the priests went to sacrifice and give incense in the mountains or on the tops thereof or in any dark and obscure caves where their idols were they used a certain ointment doing certain ceremonies to take away fear and to give them courage this unction was made with diverse little venomous beasts as spiders scorpions palmers salamanders and vipers to make an ointment of these beasts they took them altogether and burnt them on the hearth of the temple which was before the altar till they were consumed to ashes then they put them in mortars with much tobacco which herb they much used to benumb the flesh that they might not feel their travail with which they mingle the ashes making them to lose their force they likewise mingled with these ashes scorpions spiders and plmers alive then they put to it a certain seed being ground which they called ololuchui whereof the indians make a drink to see visions the virtue of this herb being to deprive a man of sense they likewise ground with these ashes black and iry rms whose hair only is venomous all which they mingled together with the black or the fume of rosin and put it in small pots which they set before their god saying it was his meat and therefore they called it a divine meat by means of this ointment they became witches and saw and spoke with the devil the priests being slubberd with this ointment lost all fear putting on a spirit of cruelty by reason whereof they very boldly killed men in their sacrifices going all alone in the night to the mountains and into obscure caves contemning all wild beasts and holding it for certain and approved that lions tigers serpents and other furious beasts which bred in the mountains and forests fled from them by the virtue of this tobacco of their god  ibid the same author tells us there is a kind of sorcerers among the indians allowed by the kings or ngus who take upon them what form and figure they please flying far through the air in a short time beholding all that is done they talk with the devil who answers them in certain stones or other things which they reverence much they tell what has passed in the farthest parts before any news can come as it has chanced since the spaniards arrived there that in the distance of two or three hundred leagues they have known the mutinies battles rebellions and deaths both of tyrants and of those of the kings party and of private men which have been known the same day they happened or the day after a thing impossible by the course of nature to work this divination they shut themselves into a house and became drunk till they lost their senses a day after they answered to what was demanded some affirm they use certain unctions the indians say their old women commonly use this office of witchcraft and especially those of one province which they call coaillo and of another town they called manchey and of the province of gutirochivi they likewise show what is become of things stolen and lost there are of these kinds of sorcerers in all parts they tell of the success of things passed or to come whether voyages shall be prosperous whether a man shall be sick or shall die or return safe or shall obtain that he pretends to they give their answers yea or no having first spoke with the devil in an obscure place so as the enquirers hear the sound of the voice but see not to whom these conjurers speak neither do they understand what they say they make a thousand of ceremonies and sacrifices to this effect and grow exceeding drunk for doing whereof they particularly use an herb called villea the juice whereof they mingle with their chica or take it in some other sort  the same author p   l   c   from the journal of william de rubruquis a french minorite friar concerning his travels into the eastern parts of the world an      tells us that when the cham of easttartary purposed to do any thing he caused three shoulder bones of ramms to be brought him and holding them in his hands he thought of the thing whereof he would consult whether he might do it or not and then delivered the bones to be burnt when they were burnt black they brought them to him then he looked upon them whether the bones by the heat of the fire were cleft right length ways if so he might do it but if the bones were cracked athwart or round pieces were flown out of them then he did not proceed for that bone is always cleft in the fire or the thin skin which overspreads it and if one of the three were cleft forth right yet he did it in mr jenkinsons voyage among the tartars we may read of such divinations so far purchase  now in reference to this way of divination a lady now in london has told my self that she knew a person in ireland who by looking on the plate bone of a shoulder of mutton it being of a sheep that belonged to the master of a family would predict the whole fate of that family and that usually with success as to who should first die and many other accidents relating to them  mr bedford minister of temple parish in bristol writ a friend of his the last year a strange relation of an acquaintance of his who often conversed with spirits and the unhappy consequences of it it is as follows  about thirteen years since i was acquainted with one thomas jerps a man about  0 years of age who lived with his father at mangerfield in the county gloucester by trade a blacksmith he was a very good tempered man extremely well skilled in the mathematical studies which were his constant delight viz arithmetic geometry gauging surveying and algebra and much addicted himself to astronomy at length he applied himself to astrology and would sometimes calculate nativities and resolve horary questions etc which he told me proved oftentimes very true but he was not satisfied with it because there was nothing in it which tended to a mathematical demonstration  having not seen him for some time he came to me one day and we being in private asked me very seriously concerning the lawfulness of conversing with spirits and after i had given my thoughts in the negative and confirmed them with the best reasons i could he told me he had considered all those arguments and believed they all related only to conjuration but there was an innocent society with them which a man might use if he made no contract with them did no harm by their means and was not curious to pry into hidden things and that he himself had discoursed with them and heard them sing etc to his great satisfaction and once made an offer to my self and another time to mr bailey now minister of st jamess in bristol that if we would go with him one night to kingswood forest we should see them and hear them both speak and sing and talk with them on whatsoever subject we had a mind to and we should return very safe but neither of us had the courage to venture i told him of the subtlety of the devil to delude mankind and transform himself into an angel of light but he could not believe that it was the devil i had several conferences with him on this subject but could never convince him in all which i never observed the least disorder of mind his discourse being very rational  i asked him several particulars concerning the method he used and the discourse he had had with the spirits he told me he had a book whose directions he followed and accordingly in the dead time of the night he went to a cross way with a lanthorn and candle which were consecrated for this purpose with several incantations he had also a consecrated chalk having a mixture of several things within it and with this he used to make a circle at what distance he thought fit within which no spirit had power to enter after this he invoked the spirits by using several forms of words some of which he told me were taken out of the scriptures and therefore he thought them lawful the spirits appeared accordingly to him in the shapes of little girls about a foot and an half high and played without the circle at first he was somewhat affrighted but after some small acquaintance he became pleased with their company he told me they spoke with a very shrill voice like an ancient woman he asked them if there were a god an heaven and an hell they answered there were he asked them what economy they had among themselves they told him they were divided into three orders that they had a chief whose residence was in the air that he had several counselors which were placed in the form of a globe and he in the center which was the chiefest order another order was employed in going to and fro from thence to the earth to carry intelligence from the lower spirits according to the directions they received from those in the air  this description being contrary to the account we have in scripture of the hierarchy of angels made me conclude them devils but i could never convince him he told me he bid them sing and they went to some distance behind a bush from whence he could hear a pleasant consort but of such music of which he never heard the like and in the upper part he could hear something very harsh and shrill like a reed but as it was managed gave a particular grace to all the rest  about a quarter of a year after this he came to me again and told me he wished now he had taken my advice for he thought he had done that which would cost him his life and his eyes and countenance showed a great alteration i asked him what he had done he told me that being bewitched by his acquaintance he resolved to proceed farther in this art and to have some familiar spirits at his command according to the directions of his book which were to get a book made of virgin parchment and consecrated with several incantations as also particular ink inkhorn pens etc for this purpose with these he was to go out as usual to a crossway call upon a spirit and ask him his name which he was to enter in the first page of his book and this was to be his chief familiar thus he was to do by as many as he pleased writing their names in distinct pages only one in a leaf and then whenever he took the book and opened it the first whose name presented should appear his chief familiar he said was called malchi after he had done this they appeared to him faster than he desired and in most dismal shapes as of serpents lions bears etc and hist at him and attempted to throw spears and balls of fire he was very much affrighted and the more because he found it not in his power to lay them insomuch that his hair stood an end and he expected every moment to be torn in pieces this was in december about midnight when he continued there in a sweat till break of day at which time they left him and from that time he was never well as long as he lived he always said he never made any compacts with any of these spirits nor ever did any harm by their means nor pried into future concerns relating to himself or others and expressed an hearty repentance for his sin  a farther account of this matter may perhaps be had from his relations or neighbors in mangerfield in gloucestershire not above a mile out of the road betwixt bristol and bath  i formerly gave an account of this affair to the late bishop of hereford in which probably there are some things contained which i do not now remember and which perhaps may be procured from his lady now living near gloucester which account would be more authentic so far mr bedford  janus mattheus an italian physician printed a book of problems at venice anno      the first problem there treated is this whether there are demons and whether they are the causes of diseases according to the opinions of divines philosophers and physicians in the third book of this problem he gives us a relation much like the foregoing relation of mr bedford and says he had it from many persons worthy of credit and from the author of the thing himself it is as follows  after the death of julius albertus a lawyer a certain friend of mine a lawyer also seized on a certain necromantick book which had been kept in a box of the said albert having got it into his possession he presently returned into a mountain where his wife was born before the discovery of the theft there he lived a long time and died never having tried the power of the book he being wholly ignorant of the magic art but on a day unwarily whispered out something concerning its magical power to his only son named arrivabenus my familiar acquaintance his father being dead and he having married a rich wife was drawn by some false companions into the fallacious practice of chemistry and when after a while he had spent much of his wives fortune and almost all of his paternal estate in chemical practices to no purpose he lights on a day on a certain german traveller who was skilful in the art of chemistry whom he carried to his house and they there tried chemical experiments together a long time but still in vain whereupon at length he discovered to the german that he had a magical book and showed it him but with engagement of secresy the german considering the book said to him pray let us try whether this book contains truth or dreams and on an appointed day arrivabenus took with him the book and a sword the german going with him unarmed for so it was agreed betwixt them and before sun rising they went into a valley through which a torrent ran and so went into a thick wood on the left side of the torrent in the midst of which having cut some bushes with the sword and made an area as it was necessary presently some ceremonies being premitted by the german wont to be used for such end and a large circle being made with a rod with certain geometrical figures they both enter into it then arrivabenus himself who would not deliver the book to the german they having so agreed held it firmly in his left hand and the sword in his right and at the germans command opened it which being done the german in the german tongue called only two demons to appear in soldiers habits and presently with a great wind and noise two demons came one a horseman with an headpiece and a coat of mail and all other meet arms and riding on a black horse the other a foot soldier going before him girt with a sword and having a snapsack on his shoulder whose eyes shined with certain movable flames that you would have judged them colliers and would scarce have been able to look on them presently as these demons appeared to the men they said what do you ask to these the german made an answer and asked them many things in the german tongue and received their answers to all things in particular at length as he had commanded them to return to hell as the were going away arrivabenus said what think you will become of our alchimy to which as the demon was going to answer begone says the german in the german tongue speak no more whereupon they returned to hell with the same wind and noise as they came after they were vanished arrivabenus began to upbraid the german for having done ill in hindering the devil from giving them an answer as to their alchimy and the next day dismissed him and by reason that for two years afterward arrivabenuss wives uncles would not pay him what remaind in their hands of her fortune as he desired because he had managed his affairs ill being struck with a rage he takes his daemonical book and goes to the same wood and area and having performed all things but one which the german had done there before behold presently with the same wind and noise of the trees innumerable demons with frightful countenances and carrying rugged staves in their crooked hands appear for through rage arrivabenus had forgot to command both how many and in what appearance they should come to him as the german had done before and stood about the circle he had made within which the miserable man stood and they scared him with threats and endeavored to pull him out of the circle all of them earnestly asking what will you have what will you have whereupon being frighted and beside himself and running to and fro within the circle in an horrid fear he fell at length out of the circle unawares the demons then fell a beating him pulling him here and there and strove to take the book from him but could not do it he having hid it in his bosom mean while arrivabenus sometimes running sometimes creeping came at length to the bridge which is over the river for he was not so far beside himself that he had quite forgot his right way but the demons threw him from the bridge into the river so that he was nigh suffocated in the mud and water now a country man casually driving an ass to fetch wood past over the bridge where his ass being frighted and flying back he saw arrivabenus tumbling in the mud half dead he called to him and laying hold of his hair drew him out of the mud and by the help of his ass carried him with much ado to his wife in the town who finding the book in his bosom which she had heard him speak of before she took it privately from him and had it burnt arrivabenus looked pale and ill ever after it though he lived a long time and anno      upon my request freely gave me this relation word for word i having heard of it long before from some others janus mathus adds for a close now what possibly may our great philosophers the perepateticks here answer truly they will either deny instances of this kind for that they consist of particulars which are neither known by discipline nor by the understanding or such things being granted they would say that these are not histories but mere dreams of some melancholy relators for certain melancholy persons so fixtly dream in the night as it sometimes happens to lovers and jealous persons of those things which with a most vehement affect they desire hope abhor or fear in the day that they seem most truly to see the same waking in the day time according to that of averrhoes l de some and vig its no strange thing that some man may see when awake what sleeping he did in his dream nay perhaps he will see the very form of the thing and not its likeness as its said of gaumr so far janus matthaeus  kircher in his oedip aegyp tom   p    tells us that in the midst of the subterraneous adyta of the egyptians there was an altar or table placed and in it the whole concatenated series of the genii were represented by such hidden symbols that they did not only notify the hidden recesses of the greatest mysteries but they had also an infallible efficacy to make one of them which the priests had a mind personally to appear by horrible and execrable adjurations and analogons rites and ceremonies  there are many relations of houses infested with demons by magical practices causing noises in them throwing stones etc of which i shall give only this instance in epit histor jon clverius tells us that an     an evil spirit infested the city of mntz and the neighboring places first throwing stones and making noises against the walls of the houses and then growing troublesome to men he began in a while to speak and to tell what things were stolen and so to sow discord among neighbors at length he stirred up the minds of all against one man as though they suffered all those things for his sins and into whatsoever house he went it presently took on fire nor was he free in the fields for fruits being there heaped together they were consumed with fire and when the neighbors for this fell upon him and were about to kill him he proved his innocence by carrying a burning hot iron in his hands he continued acting thus for three years till he had consumed all the houses with fire  there was an instance of this kind the last year in somersetshire at butley near glastenbury where lives one mr pope whose son being about    or    years of age fell often into fits and in his fits said his fathers house would be burnt by spirits whom he sometimes saw and the house was burnt down accordingly and a stall with three oxen in it and some wheat mows in his backside and stones were seen to come in at the windows in the day time no man perceiving from what hand they came as a person of glastenbury told my self the last summer at wells in the said county he upon his being in the house having seen many stones so come in at the windows this vexation continued a long time though now i hear it is ceased and the house is rebuilding there are many more particulars to be brought concerning this fact and if any man can make out that all these things were done by trick and contrivance as some say they were they may do well to satisfy the world of it  i know the late dr bekker in his book entitled le monde enchante laughs at all things of this nature as done by humane contrivance and mr scot in his discovery of witchcraft writes thus i could recite a great number of tales l    c    how men have even forsaken their houses because of such apparitions and noises and all has been by mere and rank knavery and wheresoever you shall hear that there is in the night season such rumbling and fearful noises be you well assured that it is flat knavery performed by some that seem most to complain and are least suspected and hereof there is a very art which for some respects i will not discover the devil seeks daily as well as nightly whom he may devour and can do his feats as well by day as by night or else he is a young devil or a very bungler  i know not what may be offered to men of such obstinate prepossessions who will have all things done by imposture which seem strange to them and interfere with their belief i may indulge their humor so far that if only one person tells a very strange story a man may be more apt to think it possible for that person to lie than that so strange a relation should be true but if a considerable number of persons of several countries several religions several professions several ages and those persons looked upon to be of as great sagacity as any the countries afford agree in relations of the same kind though very strange and are ready to vouch the truth of them upon oath after having well considered circumstances i think it a violation of the law of nature to reject all these relations as fabulous merely upon a self presuming conceit unless a man can fairly show the things to be impossible or wherein those persons were imposed on dr bekker rejects all the facts alleged for proving the operations of demons and among others the facts of the demons of mascon and tedworth as being done by combinations of servants or others and would have the world acquiese in his arbitrary say so without any manner of proof only alleging this frivolous pretense that there have been impostures in that kind and therefore those must be so a notable consequence which should a schoolboy infer he would deserve lashing but i shall say somewhat concerning dr bekkers work beneath it being instar omnium in its kind and therefore shall say no more of it here leaving the facts at mascon and tedworth to men of unbiased thoughts to judge of them as they see cause these relations seeming to me well attested and as well examined as if the critical dr bekker had been a party concerned on that account indeed it may not be easy sometimes to discover how a thing is done by trick though it be really so as the lord howard in his defensative against supposed prophecies c    where he treats of mens conference with damned spirits and familiars tells us that himself was present with diverse gentlemen and noblemen who undertook to descry the finest sights that schotto the italian was able to play by ledger du min before queen elizabeth who notwithstanding were no less beguiled than the rest that presumed less on their dexterity and skill in those matters and nevertheless i think it may not be difficult to discern that some facts and among others those that passed at mascon and tedworth were above all humane performance mr scot indeed tell us there is a peculiar art for doing these things which for some respects he will not discover i suppose by this art he does not mean a common combination of servants as dr bekker seems to be of opinion it is though he presently subjoins that the devil can show tricks as well by day as by night intimating as though those noises etc only happen in houses by night a time favoring impostures which is a great mistake for in the relations of the demons of mascon and tedworth and that i have given before and in many other relations of the like kind we find that many facts passed in the day time as well as by night and that stones have been thrown at persons in open fields in the day time by an invisible hand when many have been present and notwithstaning this pretense of an art unless men have an art to make themselves invisible as history tells us i know not with what truth some have done i shall never believe that any man shall be able fairly to solve the facts we have recorded of houses and other places infested by any performance of man allowing still that there have been many impostures in this kind and that many strange things may be performed as to the conveyance of voices and sounds by a deep insight in acousticks and phonicks  i shall not conceal here that in reference to what passed at tedworth a person lately told me mr mompesson owned privately to the late king charles the second that all that passed at his house at tedworth was done by contrivance and another person has told me it was done by two young women in the house with a design to scare thence mr monpessons mother this was told them by others and i found them inclined to a belief of it but whoever related this unless they were obstinate opposers of the truth either had not seen or duly considered the letter writ by mr monpesson to mr glanvil nov the   th      nor that writ by him to mr collins one of the booksellers that undertook the impression of his book it being dated aug the   th      in the first mentioned of those letters he writes thus i have been very often of late asked whether i have not confessed to his majesty or any other a cheat discovered about that affair to which i gave and shall to my dying day give the same answer that i must belie my self and perjure my self also to acknowledge a cheat in a thing where i am sure neither was nor could be any as my self the minister of the place and two other honest gentlemen deposed at the assizes upon my impleading the drummer and though i am sure this damnable lie does pass for current among one sort of persons in the world yet i question not but the thing obtains credit among those whom i principally desire should retain a more charitable opinion of me than to be any way a deviser of it only to be talked of in the world to my own disadvantage and reproach  in his letter to mr collins he informs him of what was deposed upon oath and by whom at the assizes at sarum concerning this affair where he writes thus the evidence upon oath were my self one mr william maton and one mr walter dowse all yet living and i think of as good repute as any this country has in it and one mr john cragg then minister of the place but since dead we all deposed several things that we conceived impossible to be done by any natural agents as the motion of chairs stools and bedstaves no body being near them the beating of drums in the air over the house in clear nights with several other things of the like nature these witnesses were neighbors and deposed that they heard and saw these things almost every day or night for many months together  the preceding letters are printed at the end of the preface to the second part of mr glanvils saducismus triumphatus printed together with the first part ann       after the foregoing declaration of mr mompesson i must freely tell all men that shall pretend a cheat in the translation at tedworth that till they fairly make appear to the world by whom the cheat was played and how the facts sworn to were performed the imposture must lie at their door  if we may believe luther he tells us chap    in his table talk that he departed from worms and not far from eisenach was taken prisoner and was lodged in the castle of wartburg in pathmo in a chamber far from people where none could have access to him but only two boys that twice a day brought him meat and drink among other things they brought him hazle nuts which he put into a box and sometimes used to eat of them in the night times the devil came and got the nuts out of the box and cracked them against one of the beds posts making a very great noise and a rumbling about his bed but he regarded him not when afterward he began to slumber he kept such a racket and rumbling upon the chamber stairs as if many empty hogsheads and barrels had been tumbled down and though he knew the stairs were strongly guarded with iron bars so that no passage was either up or down yet he arose and went toward the stairs to see what the matter was but finding the door fast shut he said art thou there so be there still and so he committed himself to christ and laid him down to rest again so far luther  i went my self once to see a gentleman near bath and came to his house about eleven of the clock in the morning his lady said to me she wished i had come sooner for about an hour before as she was coming in at the foredoor of the house she saw the minister of the parish come into the entry at the backdoor and to go into the hall whom she presently followed but found him not there whereupon she went up to her chamber where a midwife was to attend her she being near her time of being brought to bed and finding the minister not there as she expected she was much surprised and sent to his house to enquire for him and it was found he had not stirred out of his house that day but withal the gentleman i was to see told me they had every night noises in their house as though a man should strike hundreds of strokes with a mallet on an empty hogshead which kept himself and his whole family waking and said if i would stay a night with him i should hear the same but my occasions would not then permit me to stay  there are a world of well attested relations in this kind but all must be cheat and imposture with some men because forsooth they will have it so  to deliver somewhat of my own opinion concerning the power of magic i must own my self to have been long guided by the caution given us by corn agrppa to prevent being imposed on by pretenders to magic and other curious and abstruse arts in an epistle he sent to his friend ep l   ep    the abbot de aqua pendente where he writes as follows have a care you are not deceived by those who have been deceived for no reading of books whatsoever can direct you in this they being filled with mere anigmas o how great things are written concerning the power of the magic art concerning the prodigious images of astrologers of the powerful metamorphosis of the alchimists and concerning that blessed stone with which baser metals being touched they are presently turned into siver or gold all which things are found vain when they are practiced according to the letter and nevertheless those things are delivered and written by great and most grave philsophers and holy men whose traditions who shall dare to charge with falsehood nay it would be impious to believe that they purposely writ lies therefore there is another sense in what they write than is delivered by the letter and that covered with various mysteries but hitherto openly explained by none of the masters and which i know not whether any man can attain by the sole reading of books without a skillful and faithful master unless he be divinely enlightened which is granted to very few therefore many labor in vain who pursue these most secret arcan of nature applying their minds to the bare words as they lie for by an unhappy genius being fallen from a right understanding and intangld in false imaginations by the craft of exterior spirits they become dangerous servants to those over whom they might rule and not knowing themselves they go forth after the footsteps of their herds seeking without themselves what they possess within them and this is what i would now have you know that the worker of all wonderful things is in our selves who knows how to effect and that without all crime offense of god or injury of religion whatsoever the portentous astrologers the prodigious magicins the envious persecutors of nature the alchimists and the wicked necromancers worse than devils dare promise i say that worker of wonderful things is in us nos habitat non tartara sed nec sidera coeli spiritus in nobis qui viget illa facit he lives in us not in the stars nor hell that spirit does it which in us does dwell but these things are not to be committed to paper but to be delivered by word of mouth which i may do when i see you as to the philosophy you require i let you know that to know god the maker of all things and to pass into him by a whole image of likeness as by a certain essential contact or tie whereby you may be transformed and made a god this is the true and solid philosophy as the lord speaks of moses saying behold i have made thee a god of pharaoh this is the highest and most occult philosophy of wonderful works its clavis is the understanding for the higher things we understand the more sublime virtues we put on and the more wonderful things we work with more ease and efficacy but our understanding being enclosed in corruptible flesh unless it rises above the ways of the flesh and comes to its proper nature cannot be united to those divine powers for they do not join but with their like and is wholly impotent for perceiving those most hidden secrets of god and nature shall a man see god and live what fruit will a grain of corn bring forth unless it first dis he must die die to the world and the flesh and to all his senses and the whole animal man who would enter the recesses of secrets not that the body is separated from the soul but that the soul leaves the body concerning which death paul says to the colossians you are dead and your life is hid with christ and elsewhere he says more clearly of himself i know a man whether in the body or out of the body i know not god knows rapt to the third heaven etc i say we must die this death which is precious in the sight of the lord which happens to very few and happily not always for  pauci quos aequus amavit jupiter and ardens evexit ad aethera virtus diis geniti hoc potuere  first those who are born not of flesh and blood but of god next those who by a privilege of nature or a genethiacal gift of the heavens are dignified for it the rest build on merits and art concerning which i shall certify you by word of mouth so far agripp who has much more to the same purpose  dr flood as well elsewhere in his works as in his clavis to his philosophy and alchimy toward the end of it writes conformably to what is delivered us by agrippa as follows that the true cabalists and true alchimists are employed about one and the same thing and so the magi wise men and philosophers its what no man of a sound mind can be ignorant of since there is but one summum bonum and one true stone at which mark all that are truly wise most attentively aim some of whom are employed about the cabala others about alchimy others about the theophilosophy others about natural magic  as to agrippa i have heard some learned men say that in his youth when he writ his books of occult philosophy he had some esteem of magic but as he grew elder and when he writ his vanity of sciences he showed his contempt of it but i wonder learned men should talk thus for in his vanity of sciences he explodes magic no more than he does all other arts and sciences and indeed he writes little there against it and he says elsewhere that he writ that book sportingly only to try what young students could say for the arts and sciences they were so fond of and so valued themselves by and in his epistle to erasmus epist l   ep    he says he writ that book in a declamatory way in which all liberty of speech is used and allowed this being as scholars that take a theme and declaim pro or con at pleasure if i look for agrippas true sense of a matter i seek for it in the epistles he writ to his learned friends and correspondents and there he sufficiently expresses the esteem he had of the true magic  as to the death of the animal man mentioned by agrippa as required for initiating us toward the performance of great things dr willis as a skillful phisiologer exerc   c   in his book of the soul of brutes excellently sets forth the contest which happens betwixt the corporeal soul and the rational in the purgative life before the latter can settle the former in a due subjection and keep it self to its due purity he writes thus the corporeal soul does not so readily obey the rational in desirables as in knowables for that being nigher the body and so having a more intimate affinity toward the flesh its wholly bound to take care of the good and perservation of that for the careful performance of which office its very much drawn by the various allurements continually presented by the objects of each sense hence being employed about the care of the body and under that pretext being apt to indulge feasting and pleasures she very often gives a deaf ear to reason persuading the contrary moreover the inferior soul being weary of the others yoke on occasion being given clears it self of its fetters affecting liberty or rule and then you may clearly observe twins striving in the same belly or rather a man wholly divided by two armies fighting against each other within him infestis obvia signis signa pares aquilas and vota minantia votis this intestine contest does not wholly cease till one of the combatants being become superior leads the other wholly captive though in the mean time to establish the empire of the rational soul and to vindicate its right and empire from the usurpation of the sensitive soul the precepts of philosophers and moral institutions are put in ure and when these will not do sacred religion furnishes a far more powerful aid whose laws and precepts being duly observed they are able to raise a man not only above a brute but even himself that is above his natural state in as much as they subject the sensitive soul to the rational and both to god nevertheless this divine policy is not even so erected in man without a great contention for while reason using its own strength joined with moral and sacred precepts endeavors to draw the faculties of the corporeal soul to its side this rising on the contrary obstinately adheres to the flesh and is hardly drawn from its flatteries nay and which is to be lamented she too often seduces the chief soul in us and carries it away with it to wallow in the dirt of sensual pleasures so that a man becomes either like to or worse than a brute insomuch that reason being become brutal leads to every excess and notwithstanding the minds empire is not always and wholly overthrown but sometime or other either returning to her self of her own accord or being awakened by some occasion given and conscious of her lapse she rises up against the sensitive soul as an enemy and traitor and throwning her from her throne commands her obedience nay sometimes she compels her by reason of crimes committed to torture her self and her beloved flesh and so by inflicting punishments on her self to expiate as she may her own faults which kind of act and affect of conscience of a mans torturing himself being proper to man plainly shows him either to have two subordinate souls within him or at least that the parts of his soul are very differing whereof as the one opposes the other and contends for the mastery it happens that man is carried away to contrary purposes and is exagitated little less than a daemoniack obsessd by a legion  the same author in the same book writes more of the said contest as follows dissert   c d melanc superstition and despair of eternal salvation are wont to imprint on the sensitive soul the blood and body in a manner the like affects of melancholy as love and jealousy though some way after a different manner of affecting for in the former the object whose getting or loss is in danger is wholly immateral and its design being first conceived by the rational soul is imprinted on the corporeal in the prosecution of which if this readily obeys then no perturbation of a mans mind arises but if the corporeal soul withstanding as it often happens the rational still insists with admonitions and threats presently the other growing hot moves the blood and spirits after a disorderly manner opposes corporeal goods and pleasures to the spiritual presented by the understanding and endeavors to draw the man to her side and as thus there is a continual struggle betwixt the two souls and sometimes the will is superior sometimes the sensitive appetite prevails at length a court of conscience is erected by the mind where all particular acts are scrupulously examined by reason of these frequent variances of the souls the animal spirits as being too much and in a manner perpetually exercised and being commanded here and there contrary ways and almost distracted fall somewhat at length from their vigor and natural disposition and at last being rendered fixed and melancholic as they are detained from their wonted expansion they frame out of course and unusal traces in the brain and so cause a delirium with an excess of fear and sadness in those kinds of affects the corporeal soul being carried away as it were by violence both divorces it self from the body and being modified according to the character of the idea imprinted is wont to take a new species either angelical or diabolical mean while the understanding inasmuch as the imagination suggests to it only discorderly and monstrous notions is wholly perverted from the use of the right reason  after the like way of affecting it happens that some melancholy persons fall into imaginary metamorphoses either as to their fortunes or their bodies one imagining himself and acting as a prince another as a beggar one thinks his body to be made of glass another thinks himself a dog a wolf or some other monster for after the corporeal soul being affected with a lasting melancholy and binded in mind has wholly departed from her self and the body she affects a new species or nature and as much as in her lies really assumes it so far dr willis  i hope this may not seem an overlong digression in regard it seems to me to contain a more clear explication than may easily be found in other authors of the contest which happens betwixt our two souls within us in order to the spiritual death of the animal man and our assuming a divine nature capable of wonderful works as mentioned by agrippa  but after all the reasoning of agrippa in which he has excellently set forth what relates to internal operations of the mind and the way of bringing it to its hightest perfection and purity i do not see how he accounts for the external operations performed by magicians of which there are a world of instances unless he will have it with the arabian philosophers that the soul  the power of the imagination can perform what it pleases as penetrate the heavens force the elements demolish mountains raise valleys to mountains and do with all material forms as it pleases  mr blunden having sent a letter from london to paulus felgenbalder at amstrdm to desire his opinion concerning mgical performances he returned him an answer in latin an      which answer a gentleman having favored me with a sight and perusal of i give you here the substance of it  he divides magic and magicians into three kinds viz divine natural and diabolical now all magic he says consists in the spirit by faith for faith is that mgnet of the magicians by which they draw spirits to them and by which spirits they do great things viz either by the spirit of god or by natural spirits or by the spirit of demons therefore all magic consists in a spirit and every magician acts by a spirit magicians that are of god work by the holy ghost and the holy ghost by magicians   cor    natural magicians work all things by the natural spirits of the elements but witches and daemoniacal magicians as jannes and jambres in egypt work their magical performances by the spirit of demons he concludes therefore that all operations and works of efficacy are wrought by a spirit now he says it must be well observed that the magicians which are of god and the natural magicians very much differ natural magicians are shown us matthew     and by natural magic demons are also cast forth but not all kinds of demons and so many works of efficacy are wrought by natural magic also natural divinations and prophecies act      such the pythonissa was that raised samuel sam    who appeared in a body of wind and air as all the bodies of the dead till the resurrection which produces a spiritual body consisting of a spirit light and the heavens spiritual elements the spirits of the elements attend this natural magic and obey the magician but we must know that in some pers the natural magic and daemoniacal are  and promiscuous as the magic which is from god and the natural magic and also in some part the daemoniacal were mixed in balaam who also sought auguries numb    being willing to make himself gracious to god and also to man and so to please both and therefore the angel of god resisted him c    and for this hypocrisy he died by the sword c  0   though therefore he says natural magicians do many works of efficacy by spirits yet they do not do these in the name of god and christ though they talk much of the name adonai and call upon it yet this name may be taken in vain and by the permission of god natural spirits bring to pass auguries so also natural magic and the daemoniacal are promiscuous in some persons but if a person by natural magic should cast out demons it does not follow that this was also from divine magic and if demons are cast out by natural magic by one that is in the fear of god it does not follow that he is a true magician of god for natural magic truly casts forth spirits and demons if it be true natural magic but if it exorbitates to daemoniacal then it is condemned and when natural magic keeps within its bounds it is not condemned by christ read luke the      0 wherefore the name adonai and of christ may be used both rightly and in a sinister way rightly as in the place before quoted in a sinister way act c       and so the magicians of demons resisted the magicians of god c     and   timothy     he subjoins that even natural magic is  to be practiced by any christian because all magic is wrought by a spirit and we ought not to seek a conversation with spirits and for that satan mixes himself with the natural spirits and whereas some allow the practice of magic with the angels of god he says that no man ought to have to do with angels without gods command and with this abstract of that letter i conclude this chapter of magic  chap xi what may be suggested from reason concerning the existence of spirits and their operations kircher in epist paraenet prefixed to his obeliscus pamphilius writes thus we know a threefold demonstration has been always used by the unanimous consent of philosophers in the acquisition of science mathematical physical and moral mathematical demonstration as it inquires into the affects and properties of quantity by principles known by the light of nature of eternal truth and void of all deceit so it begets a certain and properly called science all scruple of doubt being removed physical demonstration as it comes by experiments of things to the secret knowledge of causes it begets indeed science but by reason of the experiment which for the most part is exposed to the false representations of the senses it is not void of deception nor does arrive at the certitude of the former yet according to aristotle it triumphs with the title of true science moral demonstration as it depends on the experience of humane actions begets indeed science but such as the nature of moral things admits and which is called humane faith and for the most part relies on the authority of the relater for the like cause the authority of the revealer begets divine faith more certain than all science humane authority is a certain imitation of this on which we must rely unless we will make void and annihilate the histories of all passed things i speak not here of the authority and histories of suspected credit but of those which have the clear prescription of many ages for their authority so far kircher  now laying this before us it is to be noted that christian divines do not pretend to a mathematical or physical demonstration of the existence of spirits for their existence cannot be demonstrated from their essence or the effects ascribed to them not from the first because it is not from the nature of spirits nor from that of any other creature that they exist for god so freely created all beings that he might have left them uncreated nor from their effects because the concourse of god alone or other causes might be conceived to suffice for such effects but christian divines build chiefly on divine revelation which is superior to all science and on the constant tradition of all christian divines from the first ages of christianity and all they pretend to as physiologers in what they say concerning spirits is that there is nothing in it which implies a contradiction or is inconsistent with reason and as there have been and are many phenomenon in the world which it has concerned philosophers to account for the doctrine of the existence of spirits has been hypothetically introduced into the world and backed by as great men among the gentiles as the world has had and though other philosophers have set up other hypothesis for explaining those phenomenon yet i think it would be a strange rashness in any person owning the law of moses or christ to throw by an hypothesis backed by divine revelation or rather introduced by the most learned of the gentiles consonant to it and to adhere to any other hypothesis excogitated merely by the wit of man and which in truth does not so fairly account for phenomenon as the other does or shamefully to deny facts which are to be accounted for as i know not with what unbounded confidence some even among christians have done whereas vanini who died a martyr to atheism and pomponatius who has been looked upon by some to have been of the same opinion and many others freely owned the facts which they found uncontestably manifested to them by experience and testimonies though they did not think fit to explain them by the agency of spirits but as free naturalists set up other hypothesis as they thought good for explaining them so alchindus in his works referred to nature all things that are ascribed to angels and devils as since him petrus aponus and pomponatius have done imagining that all sublunary things were wholly subject to and depending on celestials and that they received all virtues and properties the one from the other and each particular from the whole together by the means of certain corporeal rays which pass from the least even to the greatest and which they supposed the cause of all that is done in nature as marcus mar of late referred all to ideas so avicenna to inligenes galen to the temperament and these with many other philosophers have exerted all their force to take off the admiration of many extraordinary effects by setting forth the most likely causes of them they could imagine but how far a man may have reason to acquiesce in any of those hypothesis will still be the question  for the rationality of the hypothesis of spirits plutarch introduces cleombrotus l de defect orac thus delivering himself as those say very well who hold that plato having invented this element whence qualities spring and are engendered which is sometimes called the first matter and sometimes nature has freed the philosophers from many difficulties so it seems to me that those who have introduced the nature of demons betwixt that of the gods and men have resolved more doubts and difficulties and greater having found the tie which conjoins and holds together as it were our society and communication with them be it that this opinion came from the ancient magi and zoroaster or from thracia and orpheus or from egypt or from phrygia as we conjecture considering the sacrifices that are made in those countries  father le brun in his book quoted before by me c   after having set forth many odd discoveries of hidden things made by the virgula divinatoria in his second part c   examines the causes of its turning in order to discoveries and having as i conceive validly refuted all natural causes which others have pretended to assign for it he concludes it is done by the agency of evil spirits the existence of which he proves as follows  if there are effects that cannot be produced by bodies there must necessarily be in the world other beings than bodies and if among these prodigious effects there are some that do not carry men to god and make them fall into error and illusion it is a farther invincible argument that we must acknowlegde other beings than the being absolutely perfect and bodies so those extraordinary effects which can neither be called in doubt nor be attributed to god or to bodies are an incontestable proof that we must admit created spirits capable of amusing men and seducing them by deceits though therefore the scriptures had not clearly taught us the existence of spirits separated from bodies i dare say that extraordinary effects such as the discovery of many hidden things by the turning of the virgula divinatoria would give a strong proof that there are wicked spirits but their existence is clear enough in the scriptures and certainly its the best established of all the articles of our faith the least contested and the most universally disperssd through the world part   c    maimonides in his more nvochan proves with much learning and judgment that before moses the sabeans agyptians and chaldaens knew the good and evil genii all the ancient poets and philosophers owned this dogm and we find in the history of the conversion of people that it has been always sound established among the most remote nations nor can it be said as some may pretend that this is a proof of the stupidness of some nations for the most polite people differ not in this from those they call barbarians and we may see in the works of porphyrius jamblichus and clemens alexandrinus how much the doctrine of the greeks was like to that of the egyptians concerning the existence of good and evil spirits  the new converted christians of the primitive times who being disabusd of the follies of paganism were watchful on the practice of the gentiles to discover their impostures owned that sometimes prodigies were wrought by the demons minutius foelix who lived in the second century has very well set forth what the sense of the christians of those times was concerning the nature and operations of those demons whom the gentiles worshipped tertullian and origin and almost all the writers of the three first centuries have delivered the same with all the assurance that truth may give and what these great men have said is a very good answer to what is someimes objected that christ destroyed the kingdom of stan and that the prince of this world is now judged joh      st peter st paul and st john men well instructed in the words of christ and in the sense that ought to be given them tell us that the devil as a roaring lion goes about to deceive us that we ought to have recourse to prayer and keep us firm in faith to preserve us from his artifices and the snares he lays for us the devil therefore is not out of the world so that he acts no longer but is driven from a great many places where he had rule it is a truth of our faith that god has left some power to devils and he permits them on many occasions to put it in execution the frequent possessions in the first ages of the church are authentic testimonies of it and the best averred histories since christ and a thousand superstitious practices producing extraordinary effects furnish us with incontestable proofs of the operation of demons and is there any ecclesiastical writer who has not either proved or supposed this truth the learned gerson tells us what we ought to believe in this case part   p    and whence it is that this truth makes so little impression on the spirits of many persons saying certainly its an impiety and an error directly contrary to the scriptures to deny that demons are authors of many surprising facts and those that look upon all that is said of it as a fable and make a mock of divines for ascribing effects to demons deserve a severe correction sometimes even the learned fall into this error because they let their faith be weakened and their natural light be darkened their souls being all possessed with sensible things refer all to bodies and cannot raise themselves to spirits detached from matter it is what plato has said that nothing so much hinders the finding of truth as to refer all things to what the senses present us with cicero st austin albertus magnus guliel parisiensis and above all experience have taught us the same we may see a proof of it in the sadduces and epicureans who admitting nothing but what is corporeal find themselves among those senseless persons of whom solomon speaks in ecclesiastes and the book of wisdom who have pushed their folly so far that they cannot own they have a soul and effects that cannot be produced but by spirits i would there were no more persons of that mind but we shall always find some who will tell us in cold blood that they cannot believe prodigies nor miracles because they have seen nothing of extraordinary dispute not with such persons when a man will be incredulous he will be so in the midst of prodigies and miracles there are always found people tempered like celsus and lucian who will have all things to be fable illusion and imposture many persons measure all things by what they ordinarily see and hold all for false that surpass the bounds of nature they believe facts while they appear natural convince them that they cannot so be and you shall see them presently conclude them impostors  it is manifest that we conceive but two sorts of beings spirits and bodies and that since we can reason but according to our ideas we ought to ascribe to spirits what cannot be produced by bodies so far the abstract from father le brun  the author of the republic of learning in the month of august an      has given us a rough draught for writing a good tract of witchcraft which he looks upon as a desideratum where among other things he writes thus since this age is the true time of systems one should be contrived concerning the commerce that may be betwixt demons and men  on this passage father le brun writes thus doubtless here the author complies with the language of a great many persons who ib part   c    for want of attention and light would have us put all religion in systems whatever regard i ought to have for many of these persons i must not be afraid to say that there is no system to be made of those truths which we ought to learn distinctly by faith because we must advance nothing here but what we receive from the oracle we must make systems to explain the effects of the lodestone the ebbing and flowing of the sea the motion of the planets for that the cause of these effects is not evidently signified to us and many may be conceived by us and to determine us we have need of a great number of observations which by an exact induction may lead us to a cause that may satisfy all the phaenomen it is not the same in the truths of religion we come not at them by groaping and it were to be wished men spoke not of them but after a decisive and infallible authority it is thus we should speak of the power of demons and of the commerce they have with men it is of faith that they have power and that they attack men and try to seduce them diverse ways we find it in job in tobit and in a thousand other places of scripture and tradition it is certain also that the power they have depends not of us that they have it over the just since they may tempt them as they did christ though they have it not ordinarily but over those that want faith or fear not to partake of their works and that to these last particularly the disordered intelligences try to make exactly succeed what they wish inspiring them to have recourse to certain practices dialog   by which those seducing spirits enter in commerce with men all this is discovered without system so far le brun  gregory setting forth the orthodox opinion concerning spirits says that all things in this visible world are governed by an invisible being but aristotle though he assigned spiritual substances to the celestial bodies whose number he conceived according to the number of the spheres moved yet he tells us of none that preside over inferior bodies unless happily human souls and this because he thought of no operations in reference to inferior things but natural for which the motion of the celestial bodies sufficed  but the assertors of christian truth who affirm many things to be done here which exceed the power of nature have thought it necessary that angels should preside immediately over us avicenna was of opinion that only one immaterial substance presided over all inferior bodies which he called the intellectus agens but the holy doctors not disagreeing with the platonicks have taught that distinct spiritual substances presided over differing corporeal things so far greg  having set forth the opinion of christians concerning spirits established as well by reason as by authority both divine and humane i shall now consider the opinions of the perapateticks epicureans and sadduces denying the existence of spirits and shall here set down the notorious principles they generally go upon leaving those that please to follow them and to partake of the consequents of them  first aristotle held that god is not the creator of the world but that it was from eternity and will so continue phys   and met    where aquinas lect   says that he held this opinion firmly and not problematically though in his topics he says it was a problem among the ancient philosophers    that god does not take care of inferior things nay that he would become vile if he minded them met    text      that god is a necessary and no free agent as being the soul of the first sphere which he cannot but move and that he cannot move a stone with us phys   and met       that heaven and hell are the fables of legislators met   and in       that the particular souls of men die with the body and that there is only one immortal soul which is not the form of the body but assisting to all bodies    that there are no demons nor angels but the movers of the spheres who are in bliss by that motion and cannot but move them met    and l de mundo    that god does not send dreams because he would send them to the wise and not to idiots as it commonly happens l de insomn    that prophets are not inspired by a divine afflatus but grow mad through melancholy and prophecy in their madness in problem sect  0  these dogmas with others of his were censured by the councils and fathers and if admitted all religion and government must fall and aristotle for holding them was forced to fly from athens otherwise he had been questioned by the court of the areopagites  secondly the epicurean philosophy contains these errata in physics    it takes away the two chief causes of nature viz the eternal efficient and final cause    it feigns all things to arise from a casual concourse of atoms    it feigns the sun and stars to be vapors kindled and burning    it affirms the souls of men to die with the body  thirdly the sadduces   deny the resurrection    they reject all tradition of the fathers and some of them all the prophets but moses    they believe the souls of men to be mortal and to die with the body the arabian heresy which was trumpd up about     years after chrict as it is observed by the learned wigandus in his tract de homine having some alliance with this opinion of the sadduces it asserting the souls of men to die with the body though it allows it to be restored with the body at the resurrection which dogma has been new vampt of late by some of our authors whereas christ plainly says matthew  0   they cannot kill the soul    they deny gods providence and ascribe all things to mans free will    they deny angels and spirits  now the sadduces being a sect among the jews and owning at least the books of moses and finding mention there made of angels and spirits they say that by the word spirit in the scriptures we are not to understand any substantial being but either certain qualities motions or inspirations in men or else certain divine phantasms or appearances created by god to serve some present occasions which cease to be as soon as they disappear  and indeed as mr lawrence observes in his discourse of angels c   sect   the word spirit is sometimes used in these senses in the scriptures because spirits being very active natures working though powerfully yet insensibly therefore such impressions qualities and affections in men as powerfully and secretly move them are called spirits again because spirits are such pure substances as cannot be perceived by our senses therefore mere phantasms and appearances are sometimes called spirits but when it is said john     that god is a spirit etc is god only a quality or mere phantasm is he not a proper spirit or a spiritual substance  the sadduces notion of spirits seems to resemble that which monsieur charas has of the venom of vipers he thinks no man can assign any part in a viper where there is real venom and says the venom has nothing material in it that it is a pure effect of the imagination of the viper which forms to it self an idea of vengeance which he produces but in the instant of his anger and that its annihilated as soon as he ceases to be irritated for confirming which he gives us this experiment that upon swallowing the blood of a viper or pouring it on a wound no ill accident follows which a man would think it would if venom were really included in it  having laid down the general principles of these philosophers i shall now particularly consider their ground for rejecting spirits and their operations  these philosophers especially the two later who have many adherents even to this day chiefly reject spirits because they say they can have no notion of such a thing as a spiritual substance now as to this i think our late mr lock in his elaborate essay on humane understanding has fairly made out l   c    that men have as clear a notion of a spiritual substance as they have of any corporeal substance matter or body and that there is as much reason for admitting the existence of the one as of the other so that if they admit the latter it is but humor in them to deny the former he reasons thus if a man will examine himself concerning his notion of pure substance in general he will find he has no other idea of it but only a supposition of he knows not what support of such qualities which are capable of producing simple ideas in us which qualities are commonly called accidents thus if we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal substance as horse stone etc though the idea we have of either of them be but the complication or collection of those several simple ideas or sensible qualities which we use to find united in the thing called horse or stone yet because we cannot conceive how they should subsist alone nor one in another we suppose them to exist in and supported by some common subject which support we denote by the name of substance though it be certain we have no clear or distinct idea of that thing we suppose a support  the same happens concerning the operations of our mind viz thinking reasoning fearing etc which we concluding not to subsist of themselves and not apprehending how they can belong to body we are apt to think these the actions of some substance which we call spirit whereby its evident that having no other notion of matter but something wherein those many sensible qualities which affect our senses do subsist by supposing a substance wherein thinking knowing doubting and a power of moving etc do subsist we have as clear a notion of the nature or substance of spirit as we have of body the one being supposed to b without knowing what is the substratum to those simple ideas which we have from without and the other supposed with a like ignorance of what it is to be the substratum of those operations which we experiment in our selves within it is plain then that the idea of corporeal substance in matter is as remote from our conceptions and apprehensions as that of spiritual substance and therefore from our not having any notion of the substance of spirit we can no more conclude its nonexistence than we can for the same reason deny the existence of body it being as rational to affirm there is no body because we cannot know its essence as its called or have the idea of the substance of matter as to say there is no spirit because we know not its essence or have no idea of a spiritual substance  mr lock also comparing our idea of spirit with our idea of body thinks there may seem rather less obscurity in the former than in the latter our idea of body he takes to be an extended solid substance capable of communicating motion by impulse and our idea of soul is a substance that thinks and has a power of exciting motion in body by will or thought now some perhaps will say they cannot comprehend a thinking thing which perhaps is true but he says if they consider it well they can no more comprehend an extended thing and if they say they know not what it is thinks in them they mean they know not what the substance is of that thinking thing no more says he do they know what the substance is of that solid thing and if they say they know not how they think he says neither do they know how hey are extended how the solid parts of body are united or cohere to make extension etc  the learned monsieur le clerc who generally considers how far humane reason can bear in judging of points laid before it argues consonantly to what is before delivered by mr lock in his coronis added at the end of the fourth volume of his philosophical works in the third edition of them where he writes as follows  when we contemplate the corporeal nature we can see nothing in it but extension divisibility solidity mobility and various determinations of quantity or figures which being so it were a rash thing and contrary to the laws of right reasoning to affirm other things of bodies and consequently from mere body nothing can be deduced by us which is not joined in a necessary connection with the said properties therefore those who have thought the properties of perceiving by sense of understanding willing imagining remembering and others the like which have no affimity with corporeal things to have risen from the body have greatly transgressed in the method of right reasoning and philosophizing which has been done by epicurus and those who have thought as he did having affirmed our minds to be composed of corporeal atoms but whence shall we say they have had their rise truly they do not owe their rise to matter which is wholly destitute of sense and thought nor are they spontaneously sprung up of nothing it being an ontological maxim of most evident truth that nothing springs from nothing  therefore the most ancient physiologers as the very learned dr cudworth has shown in his intellectual system of the world chap   when they saw nothing in matter beside what we have said and had considered the maxim alleged they passed from the consideration of bodies to the contemplation of a much more excellent nature by which they gathered humane minds were created and all other intelligent natures therefore the consideration of the corporeal nature joined with the knowledge of the properties of our mind lead men the strait way to two tenants of the greatest moment viz the existence of a supreme deity and the creation of mans soul by god whence also is deduced its immortality to which we may add that though the authority of divine revelation be worthy of credit by it self yet it is not a little confirmed in our minds when we see the lights of revelation and right reason friendly conspire betwixt themselves for they are two sisters fallen from heaven together wherefore their agreement must necessarily be very great as being sprung from one father but we do not apprehend their agreement at first sight nor can understand it without an intent meditation if right reason denied what right revelation affirms and we thought they disagreed we should stand doubtful betwixt them nor should we well satisfy our selves which we ought to believe but they agreeing who can withold his faith from them but he that would be accounted not only to have little religion but likewise wholly destitute of reason wherefore there is no cause for those that give not credit to revelation to flatter themselves as though they were wiser than the vulgar when at the same time they naturally exclude themselves from the number of men that use reason see there also what he further smartly argues for the immortality of the soul  the same monsieur le clerc in his pneumaologia has delivered several things concerning spirits and their operations of which i have extracted the few following heads as thinking them of use for directing our judgments in considerations of that nature    those who affirm or deny that spirits can be without any corporeal property go farther than they ought for we cannot gather from the nature of spirits which is unknown to us whether they are without all corporeal property or have a subtle body sect   c      as for apparitions of spirits he says we cannot by any reason show from the nature of the thing it self that it is not possible for spirits to be joined with a subtle body nor is it likely that so many nations and so remote in places and opinions agreed in a lie as to all they have said concerning apparitions of spirits its much more likely that the ground of the lies invented about this matter was some true apparition to which as it is usual a world of other relations of the like kind have been feigned ibid    we are so far from determining what is the nature of an angels intellection that we do not comprehend even the nature of our own intellection sect   c      in what the gentiles say of demons and the hebrews of angels there is nothing contrary to any certain knowledge we have therefore it may be they say true if the thing be considered in it self sect   c      as it cannot be doubted but there are many lies in wha is related concerning strange performances by witches upon a contract with demons so it would be rashness to charge them all of falsehood especially since the scriptures relate some things like them and truly the thing it self is not so known to us that we may gather from the nature of demons which may not consist at least with many things that are related of them if any man because both good and evil angels are believed to be thinking substances should contend that they have no power on bodies because naked thought has no power on bodies before this were granted him he ought to show and that evidently first that there is nothing in angels beside thought secondly that there is no tie instituted by god betwixt their wills and some changes of bodies for if either of these may be admitted without absurdity they may also be thought able to act on bodies without absurdity sect   c      some say no true miracles but cheats are performed by demons but to understand what this means we must define the words that are here used a portent a miracle or a prodigy are here the same things and they denote an effect first above humane power secondly beside the constant course of nature thirdly that it is done at mans pleasure or at the moment he will now who can make out by certain arguments that nothing can be done by evil demons above humane power beside the usual course of nature at the moment the magician pleases since the bounds of angelical power are unknown we can here assert nothing but from experience ibid    those that deny some wonderful facts for the most part contend they are praestigia but beside that they affirm what they know not this word may be taken in a twofold sense praestigia by some are so understood as though demons present to the senses a thing that is not as if it were as that an house for instance may seem to be there where there is none but to do this either they move the brain of spectators as its wont to be moved when an house is before them or they present a certain sort of an appearance of an house in the air which strikes the eyes of spectators but choose either of these it must be shown how this is no miracle for both are done above humane power and beside the order of nature and at the time the magician pleases ibid    those opinions or diseases of the brain which witches have who think they go to feasts and dancings upon their talking of it to others that are of a timorous disposition and weak brains bring others into the same fits of fury and like a contagion spread far and near infecting many heads though it is observable that those diseases are more frequent among inhabitants of mountains and solitary places than among those that live in cities or among a concourse of people whence also it appears that the terror of vast solitudes which is apt to move the brain contributes much to this madness we must add to this that persons abounding with melancholy are more capable of this madness and on the contrary those are freest from it who are of a merry disposition which raises my suspicion that all these visions are naught but the sports of a timorous and melancholy brain  if it shall seem strange that so many men should be imposed on by their fear and temper of body all admiration may be taken away by instances of a greater fury many diseases so trouble the brain that those that labor under them seem to themselves to see things that are no where that kind of disease if it be joined with a vehement motion of the blood and lasts long it at length consumes the diseased and if the motion of the blood abates the disease is lessened and the diseased returns to a sound mind but if the disease does not so vehemently affect the blood but that it may continue a long time without destroying the diseased or a lessening of his strength strange things are presented to his mind for many years as it is manifest in many instances nor are there only those who think they see without themselves things that are no where but also such as obstinately assert themselves to be wolves or i know not what wild beasts whoever weighs these things will not wonder if opinions of witches are accounted melancholy diseases  yet though these things may be so i will not affirm that those things which witches relate have never happened but for one thing that has truly happened i believe there have been a thousand dreams of a deluded mind so far monsieur le clerc sect   c    but to return a little to the epicureans and sadduces perhaps they may desire of me a clear definition of a spirit or such an one as they would like now i think monsieur le clerc has well answered this in his preface to his pneumatologia writing thus we call all things endowed with an understanding and a will spirits but as we consider them as spiritual substances he says part   c   he has shown in his logic that the inward nature of any substances whatsoever as well as that of spirits is unknown to us wherefore men ought not to expect from us an absolutely complete description of spirits  but since these gentlemen are for having all things made out very plainly to them let us examine their physical principles democritus and epicurus would have all natural effects whatsoever to proceed from a conflux of attoms variously figured so that in every body there are particles that are round acuminated square cylindrical striated and of other configurations and that according to the various locking together of them a subject is of this or another figure operation or efficacy  now as our learned dr willis has observed this epicurean opinion l de ferm c   rather supposes than demonstrates their principles and teaches of what sort of figure those elements of bodies are not what they are and also induces motions very subtle and remote from our senses and which do not satisfy the phenomenon of nature when we descend to particulars and thinks it concerns them to show that those conceptions of theirs are real he being too short sighted to discern them so  again as for aristotles reasoning against the existence of spirits in his book de mundo if it be his viz that since god can do all things of himself he does not stand in need of ministering angels and demons a multitude of servants showing the weakness of a prince but if this argument would hold good aristotle should not suppose intelligences moving the celestial spheres for god suffices to move all without ministering spirits nor would there be need of a sun in the world for god can enlighten all things by himself and so all second causes were to be taken away therefore there are angels in the world for the majesty of god not for that he wants them and for order not for his omnipotency and who told aristotle there were intelligences that moved the celestial spheres is not this hypothesis as precarious as any man may pretend that of spirits to be and i believe there are few philosophers at present who agree with aristotle in that opinion and indeed i think kircher in the right where he tells us it is certain aristotle took his intelligences from the hebrews who beholding the multiform face of the world obel pamph page     and the discording concord of things believed it to be governed by certain presiding angels and hence also the fiction of the nine muses took its rise  moreover when aristotle lays down his principles of natural things he tells us they are matter form and privation unintelligible terms and when he comes to define his matter he tells us it is what is neither quid nor quantum nor quale nor aliquid eorum quibus ens determinatur a notable clear notion of matter obscurum per obscurius and i think no man will pretend the notion we have of spirits to be more obscure than this  in short those that will take upon them to rectify our notions of things ought to bring us notions of things more clear than what we have especially where religion is concerned as in this case it is and young wits who are well opinioned of their parts may do well to try here what they can suggest to us beyond what is here argued and i am apt to think whatever conceit they may have of themselves they will not be found so overdoing in argument but they will still find a valid reply ready for them  chap xii considerations on dr bekkers books against spirits with a conclusion to this book frommannus in his tract of fascination l   part   c   tells us that voetius above all others has made out by firm reasons that there is such a thing as diabolical and magical fascination and this he undertook as he says because upon reading mr scots book in which he has openly denied and professedly oppugnd the crime of magic and ascribes all its wonderful effects either to melancholy or other natural diseases or to the art industry and agility of men imposing on us by their praestigia or to the foolish imaginations of the said magicians or to their vain fables and fictions after it was translated into law dutch not a few from that time both learned and unlearned began to scepticize and turn libertines concerning magic  from this source i conceive among other works the four volumes of the late dr bekker entitled le monde enhante that is the world bewitched of which the first volume is translated into english have flown he generally therein agreeing with mr scot and rejecting all magical incantations  indeed the great principle dr bekker goes upon is that there were devils once in the world who corrupted humane nature but since that time god almighty put them in chains so that they have never made any figure in the world since by acting any way against mankind or otherwise  as i perused dr bekkers said volumes in french i found some persons had writ against him and thereupon i sent to holland for all that was writ against him and any replys he had made but could get only one small volume writ by monsieur binet in french entitled a general idea of the pagan divinity serving for a refutation of monsieur bekkers system concerning the existence and operations of demons printed at amsterdam an school this book is composed of six letters writ by mr binet to a friend and i shall here give you an abstract of what i find most material in them in reference to dr bekkers system in his first letter he tells us he finds in mr bekkers works much zeal and confidence in advancing novelties but no proofs to maintain them and unless you suffer your self to be surprised with a certain air of triumph wherewith he animates his expressions you will run a risque of remaining still enchanted especially if you deny certain principles which he has laid down without proof all the work will fall of it self  he observes that where mr bekker speaks of spirits all things seem to him perplexed with difficulties you shall scarce find a passage in the scripture that speaks of them all is mysterious allegorical the proper names of angels devils demons etc are but men sent calumniators evil thoughts or at most mere symbols to give us some metaphorical idea of the majesty of god  he next cites the passage following from mr bekkers preface to his first vollume  it is now looked on as a piece of piety for a man truly to fear god and also the devil if we do not this a man passes for an atheist that is for a man who believes no god because he cannot believe there are two one good and another evil but i believe says he we may with reason call those men ditheists or such as believe two gods on this passage mr binet writes as follows  this passage extremely reflecting on our belief i have rendered it word for word from the text because the translator has corrupted it by his usual softnings this accusation which mr bekker charges us with of making the devil a god almighty strikes an horror mean while it is the foundation on which he builds his whole work it is the idol he will pull down it is in which the force of his proofs consists and you shall scarce read a chapter in him but you will find this imputation but whoever believed amongst us that the devil properly speaking is the absolute author of all the works they say we ascribe to him what divine has ever considered him as a first and independent cause if we ascribe much power to the devil it is manifest we speak with the scriptures and if there be any thing which does not agree with the authors conceptions we use but the expressions which the holy ghost has consecrated and thus all mr bekkers objections address themselves to god himself who has prescribed us a way of expressing our selves in this respect  again he writes beneath you pretend to be well grounded in maintaining that we unjustly ascribe to the devil the works that are ascribed to him because he is but an instrument who borrows from god all his actions and i think we have as much reason to say that we deceive our selves in ascribing to man all his operations since of himself he can do nothing therefore it will no longer be man that moves himself speaks eats drinks but god himself for the devil and man are in this case in reference to god one and the same thing in an equal impotence and an entire dependency  you may object that this comparison of the devil with man is not just the business is to know if the one be the author of those high and sublime operations that are ascribed to him whereas we consider in the other but actions proper and natural to him but this difference though real betwixt the two creatures is but a mere illusion in reference to god in which properly consists the state of the question we consider the devil always as an instrument in the hand of god as a rod of fury which strikes but when god lets it fall on those he will visit to explain this farther i ask what virtue had moses or aaron and his rod to do so many miracles to inflict so many plagues on pharaoh and his people the simple rod in the hand of a man could not produce so many miracles of it self but one was the minister the other the visible sign which god accompanied with a divine efficacy and what would you say of a man that would impute it to us to believe that moses aaron and his rod were the sole cause of all these miracles if he enlarged himself in writing great volumes and making large reflections for giving color to this absurdity and in the mean time the scripture says ex    that aaron having stretched forth his hand with his rod on the rivers brooks and ponds caused frogs to issue from them to cover the land of egypt therefore when we conceive the devil as a rod of fury without any virtue of his own it is but by relation to god the first cause who precedes determines accompanies bends the creature how excellent soever it may be but it is manifest if you compare the devil with man you will find more excellency in his nature light in his knowledge penetration in his sight facility and power in his operations his natural knowledge is more extended not only because he beholds things with a more simple view but also by reason of the experience of all ages which discovers to him the connections which makes him penetrate the bottom of nature whose springs causes and effects he knows after a more perfect manner than the greatest philosopher and it is this great knowledge the devil has of nature which teaches him how to move the various parts whence it is that we who know not these springs and the manner to make them act are strangely struck at the sight of his operations and that we look on as a miracle what is often but the operation of a demon produced by causes otherwise applied and moved than according to the ordinary course of nature and thus as the devil has much more light penetration and activity than man we must not doubt but his power is much superior to his you see therefore that the authors odious imputations vanish of themselves and that our doctrine is neither repugnant to reason nor revelation nor to the idea of the divine perfections  and i cannot comprehend how these persons will find opposition betwixt the almighty power of god and the ministry of the devil for by this objection the author so often makes he wholly overthrows his own hypothesis he will have it that the clear and distinct idea of the divine perfections exclude the operations of demons that there is a contradiction in believing that those spirits oppose themselves to the will of god now this devil this satan these demons according to you are some calumniating men some adversary humane passions irregular motions of the spirits what you please but you cannot deny at least but these men thus characterized are as many enemies of god and of his gospel seducers persecutors give me leave to ask you then whether it be not a thing much more inconsistent with the idea of gods perfections to oppose to himself weak creatures these mortal men rather than the devil who is a spirit disengaged from matter of a consummate experience  and beneath it is in vain mr bekker imputes to us the fear of the devil no he is an enemy overcome the seed of the woman has bruised his head if he has any power remaining he derives it from god alone he is in his hand as a rod of fury to chastise men and i fear him but as the chastisements that god displays by his ministry are to be feared you see then that the author condemns himself while having established for principle that according to us this abominable and cursed creature does things more miraculous than god himself has ever done he adds that supposing what is usually ascribed every where to the devil and his angels there cannot be convincing proofs that jesus is the christ or that there is but one god and i confess says he that if i do not possess the reader with a clear conception of this in what i have writ it is in vain that i have composed it now supposing that the devil acts but ministerially and dependently of god supposing that we attribute nothing to the devil properly speaking of miraculous that can be put in opposition to or parallel with the works of god our proof that jesus is the christ and that there is but one god are exclusive to all other in regard that it being very far from there being any prerogative in this cursed spirit that can be confounded with those which god possesses in the highest degree of eminency he has deprived himself by his revolt of his most pure advantages and has precipitated himself into  abyss of miseries where the idea of  severe god makes him tremble  in his fifth letter he writes thus  because a truth has been corrupted by diverse fictions must it presently be rejected there is no principle no natural notion that can undergo this examen without being condemned there is none but has been ill conceived and abused then there will be none that can lawfully be admitted let us conclude therefore in general that though men have erred infinite ways concerning the doctrine of demons that they have been conceived as substances either material or spiritual or mixed though some have placed them in the stars others on the earth others in hell though there have been as many sentiments as heads concerning their offices though they have been called sylphes gnomes salamanders all this will but prove at most that men have ill conceived the nature and operations of demons but no way that we must entirely reject the ground of this doctrine by reason of the fables superstition has mixed with it  and beneath were it true as it is gathered from the exposiions of mr bekker always opposite to himself that there were in the old testament no term which signified properly or that could according to the genius of the hebrew language and the use then signify those spirits which we call satan devils etc the jews would have taken these terms in their proper signification so that by this name satanin they had not understood satans angels of destruction or of death but only adversaries men enemies to god and his truth  sadduces for example had had  st paul of ignorance for following the sentiments of the pharisees who took the affirmative since the pharisees would have ill understood all the terms of the old testament which had signified originally and according to the then use not angels and satans but only men either good or evil if then the jews were imbibed in substance with the common doctrine of devils it is because they took these expressions either for these pure and favorable intelligences or for these impure and adversary spirits and if they understood them in this sense being the same which the holy ghost has used in the books of the old testament they will have the same signification and if they have the same signification they will consequently be these same spirits which operate here below for there is not one passage where these terms are found but formally teaches us their operations so that it is an uncontestable principle which mr bekker did not foresee that if the old testament teaches us the existence of devils we ought necessarily to infer their operations because they there appear every where operating  again if those terms of the old testament which some pretend we abuse to establish the operations of demons signify properly but men dvsaries and if the holy tongue had never employed them to express these wicked spirits it is not to be doubted but the jews would have thrown it in our dish you should have seen them exagerate the easiness of the christians to admit  of the operations of demons as  pagan and reproach them their gross ignorance in understanding the hebrew tongue if they forbear it and concur with us in defending the opinion of the operations of demons though they have added to them some fables it is because that beside they know the true signification of these terms and that we do not make use of them to contend against them there would be too much absurdity to contest the sense of them  we find according to mr bekker that what we believe of demons is in substance but what the babylonians taught the jews it is what this gradation from the babylonians to the jews from the jews to the first christians from the first christians to the papists from the papists to the protestants evidently makes out but i wonder god has suffered his church always to be infected with this error and that neither the prophets that were at babylon nor those that instructed the israelites after their reestablishment who thundered with so much vehemence against errors did not oppose themselves to a superstition so gross and impious  christ came into the world to destroy the works of the devil his prophetic office obliged him to instruct the ignorant and oppose superstition you see him every where reprehending vices and thundering against errors without any bearing o them but as for the operations of angels and devils we find not the least censure nor the least correction would he have suffered these wanderings of mans mind without recalling it to its  errors says mr bekker have  foundation of the christian religion and would jesus christ have left them in their full vigor in using the same terms the jews had corrupted the pagans had abused and giving then the same ideas  if the jews had corrupted the terms of angels and demons in giving them a false signification would jesus christ instead of dissipating these prejudices of the jews have confirmed them in their error in expressing himself in the same terms without having restored them to their true sense and in fomenting superstition by fabulous examples of men obsessd and delivered from demons would the apostles have authorized error in ascribing every where operations to devils which neither the jews nor pagans could have took in another sense than that which was then in use compare this objection with the   th chapter of the authors second book for i pretend that the way mr bekker there answers renders my objection wholly unanswerable  in his sixth letter he writes thus mr bekker owns that all the pagans ancient and modern europeans asians africans americans both north and south agree in these three chief points which are of an incontestable truth   that there is only one first being or one supreme deity   that there are spirits that have had a beginning and that are distinct from humane souls   that those spirits are either good or evil and that some of them are friends to men and others enemies  see here then all the world imbibed with an opinion of demons whence  that what they know how erronus  it may be must be known to them by the way of operation and to set this truth in a clear light observe it is impossible that one self same belief universally dispersed and constantly received can be entirely false in the bottom i say in the bottom not to confound with the substance of this doctrine the erroneous ideas under which it has been conceived and which have been diverse according to the diversity of the imaginion  and beneath we cannot find by any certain history that the americans had any communication with the rest of the world till of late years yet this imagination of demons has been preserved among them for a great number of ages notwithstanding their ignorance brutishness and extravagances  you may say you cannot maintain that the knowledge of demons carries the characters proper to natural truths god has not imprinted them in the imagination and reason how clear soever it may be cannot raise it self so far without the aid of revelation but i say if demons have been universally and constantly received by all the people of the world this knowledge must flow from some solid cause it comes neither from the scripture nor from reason nor from the imagination it is derived therefore only from the operations of demons  again as for the surprising operations of demons on the idolaters mr bekker says those who know not god as christians know not also the devil but a clown would have reason to laugh at mr bekker if he would pewade him that because he knows not the nature of the soul and of the body and the laws of motion he should not pretend to feel a sound box on the ear given him and it is ridiculous to deny the operations of demons on people because they are not so good divines as to raise themselves to the knowledge of god and the mysteries which his word has revealed to us or because they are ignorant of the true doctrine of demons so far mr binet  this author having made the foregoing reflections on dr bekkers four volumes i shall have the less to say to them however as i think it proper for me to add some considerations of my own i shall first set down as briefly as i may what i find most material in dr bekkers volumes deserving an answer and then offer what i have to reply  in his first volume he sets forth the various opinions of people in the world concerning evil spirits and their operations and having there given an account of many christian authors as well as others who have countenanced their operations in several respects in his   d chapter he writes thus but i find no author who in time passed has ascribed so little understanding and virtue to the devil as for what relates to all those knowledges and effects set forth by me as reginald scot we have at present antony van dale who ascribes no more to him in his book of oracles these two authors hold that there is no other efficient cause of all those things that are practiced or wrought but the impostures of men the devil having nothing to do in them i hear also every day while i am employed in this work that the men of the best sense among us ascribe but very little power and knowledge to the devil and that there are many more than i thought who as to persons possessed and bewitched are of the same opinion with monsieur daillon who in what he has writ in french concerning demons maintains that all that is contained in the scriptures concerning evil and impure spirits ought not to be understood otherwise than of certain diseases to which the jews were wont to give such names he believing nevertheless that it might be that evil spirits came at the same time to concern themselves in it and beneath he adds my scope here is to relate what is said of the devil and his power and to examine whether it be true or not and i hold the negative because it is much contrary to me to maintain an opinion which ascribes so much power and virtue to spirits especially evil spirits wherefore i must rank my self with scot van dale and many others who are opposite to the belief men have of this power  in his   th chapter  0   he tells us we have all the reason of the world to hold for pagan legends all the pagans have published concerning miracles oracles of their gods aereal specter dreams and so many other prodigies as well as all the papists obtrude upon us in that kind and he thinks it is clearly enough proved by all the citations he has made in this book that there are no miracles oracles purgatories apparitions of spirits or souls of diabolical arts and illusions or sorceries by letters and characters or of choice of days neither in judaism nor papism but draws its origin from paganism we must reject all at once or leave all to subsist together of what kind soever it be we ought to discharge our selves of all these prejudices and join reason with the scriptures to ground our selves on them and look upon those alone as pure sources  in his second volume c     he writes thus all the learned agree that affirmanti incumbit probatio but he that denies a thing or doubts only of it does enough when he alleges reasons of his doubts and much more yet when he sifts and curiously examines those reasons he might expect from the persons concerned it is what he has resolved to do in this place first as to what has never been alleged by reason and afterward as to what has never been taught by the scriptures  c       he says that the devil by the first sin that was committed in paradise is the cause of all evil and consequently all the evil that is done ought with just reason to be imputed to him and beneath you can find nothing that can prove that the devil after having seduced man at the beginning of the creation has had since in person the least power on him or his actions but indeed that all the evil that ever happened or is still committed in the world is considered by reason of this as if the devil himself did it  c  0    he says as for the fall of man it is certain it was caused by the devil but to know the way how it is altogether uncertain  c       he argues thus as it is manifest that that which has no existence can produce nothing whence comes it that the devils or unclean spirits did those things which the gospel mentions and by those that were possessed by them i answer the pretended unclean spirits are always named in case of maladies and that so it was understood by those that were attaqued or infected with diseases and scourges of god that reigned at that time and he says if you say the apostles since christ have not freed us from that error that the demons are really such spirits and that they have such a power he answers this is not so easily granted because eidola false gods or idols and the daimonia are one and the same thing now st paul tells us that the idols or false gods are nothing at all  c     0 he says as for angels he does not deny but they have appeared sometimes but he believes not so many apparitions of the devil    he owns there are men that naturally see specter and phantomes more often than others but he says it is the natural disposition of the body of the man of his blood and spirits which makes him believe he really sees what he sees no farther than he believes  c     0 he says he concludes that the devil has not the least knowledge of the world nor of the things that concern religion nor of the affairs of faith  c       he says he has shown that the devil can do nothing in reality nor in appearance    he says the angels are the ministers of god in all places both to punish men and to protect and defend them but as for the devil he is gods prisoner after which he has no more to say on this matter  in his third volume c     he says the question is not whether there are enchantments or the like but what we ought to understand by enchantments and in what it consists whether it be deceit subtlety covert wickedness etc or whether those they call magicians really work by the devil  c     he says he is of opinion that what the egyptians did was only in appearance and nothing real  c      he says if we think to fright people with specter to teach them so much more to fear god it is a miserable thing in christianity that people must be brought to god by a servile fear which naturally makes us fly god or that we serve him without love if it be with this fear with which we ought to serve god has not christ rendered us a poor service for having delivered us  c       as for those they call possessed persons he says he confesses he has no knowledge of the least operation of the devil on the body in the body and by means of the body no more than of those some will have him do on the soul of man for none of all these evil spirits ever were or are in any place of all the bible devils so called but the evil spirits were troublesome torments and incurable ills of which christ cured many persons by his sole word and assisted the apostles when they undertook to do it  in his fourth volume c     he says he has shown that the ancient magic was nothing but surprise or imposture according to all the scripture says of it   he says that all which men think to be an action of spirits by reason of the subtlety with which it is done is an effect of subtle and indivisible substances the knowledge of the most subtle matters and of the extent of their motion may show us that all that is commonly ascribed to magic or the operations of the devil may be natural the most subtle parts of bodies entering in issuing forth and passing through bodies are the cause of all the changes which happen  0 he says all he has said is to show that there are sometimes very surprising things done whereof we cannot outwardly know the causes and which nevertheless ought to be ascribed to the motion assembling or separation of these little bodies one way or other  c      he says we shall now examine whether there has ever happened in the world that any thing of the nature of those we call apparitions phantoms or magic that ought not to be ascribed to those atoms which often in moving themselves in separating or joining themselves to one another can cause the same aspects the same sounds the same motions in men and about them that are ascribed to spirits or the devil in particular  c     0 he says men take the word devil satan witch and magic in quite another sense than it is found in the scripture searching with all the exactness imaginable so much from dr bekker  on what i have set forth from this author a man has room to write a large volume but i shall contract my self in a little compass  as for this persons undertaking from scripture and reason to introduce a new doctrine amongst us concerning evil spirits contrary to what the whole stream of those learned teachers who have conveyed religion to us have constantly taught us hitherto i think it may be looked upon as a very bold and surprising attempt and i believe the learned part of christians will consider the matter very maturely before they part with a doctrine so long taught them  it seems to me a strange confidence in dr bekker and indeed no less than that of socinus and other innovators that through a selfpresuming conceit of his outdoing insight in the scriptures he should now pretend to tell us that though he allows good angels have appeared sometimes yet there has been no devil in the world since he tempted our first parents to sin whereas the scriptures every where speak as plainly of evil spirits and their operations since the fall as of good spirits neither do i believe that any person adhering to dr bekkers doctrine will ever be able to assign the least reason why god almighty should have permitted the devil to tempt man before the fall and not since and though dr bekker and dr van dale have shown themselves men of learning yet we know there have been many protestant divines since the reformation who have given the world much greater specimens of their insight in the oriental languages which the others so much pretend to for inabling them to a right understanding of the scriptures who notwithstanding never took the words devil satan witch and magic in that sense they have done  but as for the origin of idolatry and the doctrine of demons among the gentiles i think no man has better set it forth than kircher in his oedipus aegyptiacus whom those authors have not pleased to take notice of as i think it might have been proper for them he having given an account of it quite contrary to what they have writ this man had all the advantages that a great writer could have he had great natural parts used great industry had a great correspondence with the learned in most parts of the world had the command of near twenty languages and the favor of many great princes who assisted him with all sorts of books and other necessaries for carrying on so great a work in which he acquaints the world he spent twenty years labor with a very intent study page     in his first tome of his said work he writes thus  st ambrose wisely and truly says that humane error was the cause of idolatry and with him hermes trismegistus ad asclep c    that the origin of the detestable idolatry of the egyptians was the error and incredulity of their ancestors in which egypt always wallowed for as they did not apply their minds with a due reverence and consideration to the worship of the true god and the divine religion and nevertheless were possessed with a desire of some religion they found out the art of making idols but as they knew not how to animate them using wicked arts and diabolical conjurations and calling forth demons they forced them into them and to give them more virtue and strength they consecrated to them animals of diverse kinds which they called sacred adoring in them the souls of those persons who have been famous for virtues and facts they had performed calling by their names those cities that had been either built or instructed with wholesome laws and ordinances by them to their honor also they instituted various sacrifices which sort of rites and ceremonies mor isaac a maronite most elegantly describes in his syrian philosophy as follows  then arose men of the seed of cham having corrupt manners whose minds were corrupted through ignorance and demons that seduced them and they taught one thing for another and thought the stars were endowed with a spirit of intelligence that they had a free liberty and power and by degrees the devil made them err till they thought the stars to be creators and makers and they gave to each star the name of a god and they worshipped them with various ceremonies falling down before them and adoring them and they set up various idols in their names and placed them on the tops of high pillars and walls of houses exhibiting their figures after various manners and to these they offered victims and sacrifices burning incense before them and the devil at certain times speaking from each of them gave answers to those that asked them predicting future things and revealing things hidden and presently told of things that were done in places very remote and put thoughts into their minds which he revealed to others and he has seduced very many of those men even to this day now these rites were proper to the egyptians which afterward passing to others infected by degrees the whole world  now from what is here delivered by kircher we find we may allow what dr bekker says viz that the eidola false gods or idols and the diamonia of the gentiles are in a manner one and the same thing and say with st paul that the idols or false gods are nothing at all for as the pagans adored in their idols the souls of persons that had been famous for virtues or great actions done for the benefit of mankind or their supposed spirits of the stars these indeed were nothing there but as they applied themselves to these for receiving answers they desired or for being otherwise gratifyed by them in other desires it was the devil who deluded them in giving them answers and doing other things as they desired so that their conversation was with him who kept them in continual idolatry though they did not direct their worship directly to him  so again kircher in his second tome of his said oedipus part   treating of hieroglyphical magic in his third chapter which treats concerning the divinations and oracles of the egyptians sets forth that the mind of man being still agitated with a desire of the goods both of body and soul p     and seq and eagerly wishing to secure them perpetually to himself applies its study to the knowledge of future things whence the devil as being enemy of mankind laying as many snares as there are appetites of humane machinations at length sets upon him with an hope of the knowledge of those future things now there are two chief nets he lays astrology and polymancy by the first he teaches the lot which each man has gotten from the first minute of his nativity as to a good or bad fortune by the latter he presents as under the veil of natural causes various kinds of divinations with which the uncautious while they unadvisedly go about to pursue good and shun evil are justly deprived of the eternal good these arts cham the son of noah first introduced into the world by the instigation of the devil which the aegptians instructed by cham have transfused into the whole world as it were by a certain hereditary tradition as for their astrology he has treated amply of it before and here he takes upon him to give an account of their divinations and their origin and concerning the nature of their oracles  before i give you an account of what he says concerning the latter i shall give you two or three particulars of what he says concerning their astrology  in his forementioned tome p     he writes thus i dare solemnly affirm that all our present judicial astrology relating to nativities and horary questions retains even to this day that occult pact with devils which the ancient egyptian astrology did  p     he says the egyptians did not so much ascribe to the stars as to the genii presiding in them the events of things hence there was an earnest desire care and solicitude to render them propitious by previous ceremonies and sacrifices otherwise then the astrologers of our times deal who rashly ascribe the fortune of men to a certain fatal necessity of the stars  p  00 he says the egyptians held that gods or genii inhabited the stars for they thought the inferior world depended on their virtue and efficacy not by the proper influsive force of the stars but by the disposing power of the deities who being seated in the stars as an instrument for the disposition of inferiors etc as for what is said more concerning their astrology i refer the reader to the author  as for the egyptians divinations and their origin and the nature of their oracles they thought that beside the celestial gods there were certain middle natures which they called angels demons genii or terrestrial gods to which they ascribed the rise and fall of their oracles and so that the oracles lasted so long as the said genii continued in the statues which delivered oracles and that they ceased when the statues were deserted by the genii or demons now they affirmed these genii to inhabit the region betwixt the heavens and the earth and to consist of herbs stones spices and other terrestrial matters containing a natural power of a divinity in them and that as living near us they were joined to us by a friendly alliance and they thought them to be affected with a singular love toward mankind according as their nature bears predicting future things by oracles and taking care of other things belonging to us wherefore they entered statues rightly prepared by men and gave answers from them to those that consulted them and stayed in them many years by so much the more willingly by how much the statues were made of matters more agreeing to them and by how much the more skilful they were to detain them by sacrifices hymns prayers and harmonies with which only allurements of them they are delighted and trismegistus in his pymander says their ancestors had not a perfect knowledge of the celestial deity for god being known they had not cared for terrestrial gods but as being uncertain of him greatly straying from the divine religion they excogitated an art whereby they might make gods erecting statues and as they could not create souls for them they called the souls of angels or demons into them which came upon calling both because the power of these men was great and because angels and demons have so great an alliance with men that they are drawn by a natural obsequiousness to them  but to return to the oracles they were the root and foundation of all divinations and superstition nor did the devil always give answers with a sensible voice but discovered what he pleased by certain signs hence first arose the various kinds of rites and ceremonies with which as it were with previous dispositions they were wont to purge the mind that it might become conscious of future things then turning themselves to vain observances they took all the ludibria of obvious things for auguries but let us explain them in particular i find that in a manner in all the prefectures of egypt there was an oracle from which consulters received answers concerning various events not that every particular oracle answered concerning every thing proposed to them but only concerning things agreeing to their nature thus the oracle of serapis about things that concerned agriculture of anubis of things relating to sciences of horus about things concerning the good of the body and soul of isis about things concerning nilus or fertility but the oracle of ammon as being the most famous of all gave answers concerning all things proposed so in innumerable other places oracles were set up all which gave answers in obscure places obsessd by evil spirits by a voice dreams a gesture and a nod of the statues by a sound a ringing or other signs and they were given either by the demon himself or by pythonists or by priests inspired with a fatetelling spirit which from caves and obscure deep vaults with an horrible sound and noise rushed out on the enthusiasts in the likeness of fire with which being wholly surrounded and driven into a fury they uttered those things which the demon suggested to them with a palpitation of all their limbs their eyes turned upwards and their mouths distorted after this manner satan the architect of superstitions insinuating himself by stealth into the minds of men by idolatry made it his business to inculcate to them devoted services of rites and ceremonies by which they should worship his commentitious gods under a pretext of piety and virtue that under these colors he might involve and pollute them in all kinds of impiety and wickedness and derive to himself the honor due to god  and as there was nothing so obvious to our senses which the demon did not assume as certain signs to show his will and nilling to those that consulted him hence manifold kinds of divinatory magic arose hence issued the spawn of all kinds of portentous sorceries and divinations etc so far kircher  now laying this before us i must say that notwithstanding all dr van dale has writ concerning oracles as being wholly contrived by the impostures of men i must wholly assent to what kircher has here set forth concerning them and this not only because kircher and others have so delivered it to us but chiefly because even at this day there are persons who upon casting themselves into a trance and otherwise can and do predict future things reveal things hidden and tell of things done in places very remote like to what was done by the oracles as i have set forth in this work which must be ascribed to the agency of evil spirits as i shall show beneath  indeed that many things in the egyptian oracles were done by the impostures of their priests it is what kircher freely owns in the third tome of his said oedipus p    where he writes as follows  we have shown in several parts of this work that demons did not only speak from various statues as from certain oracles but that even priests themselves to keep the people in a greater cult and veneration toward the gods imposed on their simplicity by their craft and the use of these speaking statues was so frequent in egypt that there was scarce a prefecture without them and so that the chief end of the priests seems to have consisted in this to draw demons by magical adjurations and various incantations into statues first consecrated by due rights in the adyta and being drawn to consult them concerning various demands and because the demons did not always give answers agreeing to truth but wholly fooled those that consulted them many ways hence the priests performing the office of a demon and applying themselves to fraud made statues with such an artifice that by occult pipes conveyed to the head of the sttues they muttered voices as it were of the gods and what answers they pleased to impose on the superstitious people who being deluded by this impious cheat of the priests were more and more animated to make oblations and offer gifts due as they thought to the gods but in truth to those deceitful priests who thought they had done some great thing if what was done by the craft of a fraudulent wit obtained in the minds of the simple people the opinion of a divine work of the gods and of a miracle so far kircher  but to conclude from this with dr van dale that all that passed in the oracles of the ancients was done by humane contrivance without any agency of evil spirits is what i can no way assent to for the reason above given  to return to dr bekker as to what he says that the knowledge of the most subtle particles of matter and of the extent of their motion may show us that all that is commonly ascribed to magic and the operations of the devil may be natural and that all apparitions and phantomes sounds etc commonly ascribed to the operations of demons may be caused by the action of those atoms i should asked him here whether the action of those subtle particles of matter can exert it self to an intellectual and voluntary agency for this is the true state of the question and not to tell us that seemingly occult sympathies and antipathies and the like may be solved that way which we own may be true and i think i have sufficiently shown in this book in the foregoing several heads of mens preception of spirits that the actions i there ascribe to spirits have resulted from intellectual and voluntary agents if he should say the actions of such subtle particles could arise to such agency i think i have fairly shown before from mr lock and monsieur le clr that the notions of matter and of an intellectual and voluntary agent are clearly distinct and incommunicable to each other  again as for his raising the action of the particles of matter to this pitch this would equally take away the operations of good spirits as well as evil whereas he allows the former so that i think he had been more consonant to his principles in setting up for sadducism or epicurism denying both good and evil spirits than to take up with this halfspirited opinion which i know not whether any man has ever held but himself  indeed we may allow what dr bekker says that good angels may sometimes punish men by gods appointment as well as protect and defend them but we say there have been frequent manifestations of wicked facts done by spirits and such as could no way consist with the nature of good angels therefore there must be allowed of both kinds unless the doctors subtle particles shall solve all and whereas in his second volume he says the facts ascribed to spirits chap   sect   are perhaps such as a mans spirit can do as when a man possessed with a pretended evil spirit speaks strange languages which he had never learned before this he says may be solved if we embrace the opinion of justin viz that the souls of the dead can enter into the bodies of the living for then he says why may it not be that the soul of a man skilled in many languages is that which after the death of its body speaks by the means of that which is yet alive those same languages he had learned living but he says he is not of this opinion though this may suffice to convince those by what they say themselves that confound one thing with another in believing this of the soul and that there are angels for the same reason which experience proves not that there are or that they exist  now as to this since the doctor did not hold the opinion of justin nor deny that strange languages had been spoken by ignorant persons he might have done well to have explained how that could be done without the agency of spirits and as for his charging those with an inconsistency that hold this opinion and with all the agency of spirits is it that because some particular person has set up such an hypothesis for solving that fact there must be no spirits so we know that marcus marci who generally takes upon him to solve all phenomenon without god angel or devil has set up another hypothesis for solving the said fact he supposes that ideas are conveyed into all persons with the seminal principles derived from parents and ancestors and that when these ideas upon certain critical junctures come to an evolution a man may come to speak any of those languages which any of his ancestors were skilled in but what if men set up such hypothesis the question will still be whether these hypothesis are more cogent upon our understanding for their admittance than that of spirits or whether our reason acquiesces more easily in them  and i think apol   i may here justly charge these men as justin martyr does others in a like case saying some oppose to us mrcion who even now teaches men to deny god the maker of all things in heaven and earth and christ his son predicted by the prophets and introduces another god beside the maker of all things and also another son by whose authority many being swayed they deride us as though he were the only man that knew truth and as they have no demonstration of those things they say without all reason being seized as lambs by a wolf they become the foul prey of mens dogmas and of devils  tandlerus in his answer to a question proposed concerning the divination and other wonderful effects of melancholic persons first tells us that those melancholic facts or energies may be reduced to two kinds one is of those who are said to have spoken languages of which while they were themselves they were wholly ignorant or to have shown an understanding of those arts which they never acquired to themselves by learning the other is of those who are said to have had a certain power and faculty of discovering occult things of commemorating past things that were unknown to them and of predicting future events whose truth experience it self at length has shown to be so to the first kind belongs that rustic mentioned by guainerius who always the moon being combust made verses and the combustion being passed about two days till she came to another combustion could not speak a word of latin and this man had never learned letters and here that sailors boy has place who as forestus tells having received a blow on his head as he passed a bridge in his delirium always made syllogisms in the german tongue and that excellently and that afterward being cured he knew not how to do it  of the latter kind we have rhasis a witness among the arabians and alexander who was in no mean rank among the ancient physicians and among these persons he thinks we may not unfitly place exstaticks  now he says there is a very great dissension among authors in assigning the causes of these stupendous actions of persons seized with a melancholy distemper some laboriously inquire into the natural causes of them others ascend to supernatural as for those who acquiesce in natural causes he finds two sects of them the first is of astrologers ascribing all the works of melancholic persons to the influences of the stars as guinerius does building on certain platonic and astrological principles he says that the soul before it is infused into the body contains the knowledge of all things in it self but that it is in a manner abolished by the union with the body with whose fetters it is held ensnared after it is infused nor can it be otherwise recovered but by teaching or by an influx or impression of the planet which presided over his nativity at the very time the soul was infused into the body he will have the force of this impression to be so great that it may endow the soul with a faculty of producing such actions as the star is wont to produce elsewhere so that it may make a well man sick and a sick man well also cause snow and rain but that the body and corporeal senses resist this impression especially as to knowledges it being otherwise of efficacy enough in it self these senses therefore being bound as it happens in melancholic persons and the star working on the soul without resistency it comes to pass that the soul understands all things without discourse foresees future things answers concerning arts to which it inclines by the force of the influencing planet the second sect is of natural philosophers who seeing that the minds of men are variously affected with the melancholic humor and that most that have excelled others in understanding or in learning arts or in administration of government or in performing other things were naturally melancholic they stuck not to ascribe so great force to it for as there are many found who are naturally inclined to diverse arts so melancholy they say is naturally inclined to work wonderful things and as high fermented wine immoderately taken changes mens manners and causes them to differ from themselves so they contend that if the melancholic juice exceeds its convenient measure in a person or be rendered more hot or cold than is fitting gets a certain singular force wholly to change the mind and to stir up wonderful motions in it  now tandlerus after having stated these opinions rejects them for though he does not deny the power of the stars for changing the temperament of the whole body and of each of its parts in particular and for giving an inclination either for the knowledge of tongues or for diverse disciplines yet this he stiffly denies that the very knowledge of tongues is any way conferred by the stars without teaching or their use without any precedent knowledge for certain reasons he gives nor can he acquiesce in their opinion who think these kinds of prodigies ought to be ascribed to the property of the melancholic humor for though there be a certain occult force of the melancholic juice that it may produce operations causing admiration yet it cannot be so great as to beget a knowledge of languages and of occult and future things these certainly are owing to a superior cause not that while he denies these things to have place in the melancholic humor he therefore denies what aristotle says viz that melancholic persons are  that is have direct dreams by which they may have a forepreception of certain future things for there are two kinds of divination one natural common to men with brutes whereby without discourse by the sole guidance of nature some animals have a foresense of things as well for avoiding hurtful things themselves as for admonishing men of certain iminent events so ants have a natural foresense of the approaching winter from the going away of sparrows many physicians believe we are admonished of an approaching pestilence such a presaging faculty is often found in some fools who by nature have a vitiated reason in whom doubtless nature makes a recompense one way for what it takes away in another so marcus maci says those whose minds are employed in speculations phil vet rest par   sect   which take up the soul do not easily perceive sympathetical impressions whence presaging and predictions are wont to be sent to simple persons rather than to wise men and that happens much more to brute animals than no men those being presently filled with the celestial image being void of any of their own the same things happily sometimes occur in melancholic persons especially in those whom nature has particularly brought forth such the other kind is artificial which is grounded on an observation of events or on certain signs and because it consists for the greatest part in a comparing together of natural causes as well betwixt themselves as of the effect it is also called natural though this depends of certain rules yet the inclination of nature which proceeds partly from the temperament and humors and partly from a fortunate and meet position of certain stars hold the chief place in it for we see some by a peculiar guidance of nature being cultivated with an indifferent knowledge of the stars far more truly and readily to hit out future things from obvious or little previous marks than those who excel only in art being destitute of the aids of nature nay some by this very force of spirit arrive at a full insight in many things which art with labor would not come to the knowledge of or attain with difficulty such a facility of conjecturing since it happens for the most part in persons inclined to melancholy which happily may be increased by a fortunate concourse of the stars i easily grant that melancholic persons are not only  but likewise that they excel others in the prediction of future things but here we speak of another kind of divination when ignorant persons without conjectures and observation of events bring secret things to light prophecy of those future things which are neither known to themselves nor others nay when they come to themselves they know not that any such thing was done by them these things he says he judges could no way arise from an humor especially exceeding the bounds of nature  he concludes therefore that the devil is the author of all these things though not alone but joined with the melancholic humor which he exagitates at his pleasure and causes certain operations which that humor had not been able to produce by its own force  since we are upon this point of ignorant peoples speaking unknown languages i shall give you one particular instance of it taken from a letter sent by the late lord lauderdale to mr baxtr which letter was printed anno      in mr baxters historical discourse of apparitions and witches he there writes among other things as follows  i shall here tell you of a real possession near the place where i was born about thirty years ago when i was a boy at school there was a poor woman generally believed to be really possessed she lived near the town of duns in the mers and mr john weems then minister of duns a man known by his works to be a learned man and i know him to be a godly honest man was persuaded she was possessed i have heard him many times speak with my father about it and both of them concluded it a real possession mr weems visited her often and being convinced of the truth of the thing he with some neighbor ministers applied themselves to the kings privy council for a warrant to keep days of humiliation for her but the bishops being then in power would not allow any fasts to be kept i will not trouble you with many circumstances one i shall only tell you which i think will evince a real possession the report being spread in the country a knight by the name of forbes who lived in the north of scotland being come to edenborough meeting there with a minister of the north and both of them desirous to see the woman the northern minister invited the knight to my fathers house which was within ten or twelve miles of the woman whither they came and next morning went to see the woman they found her a poor ignorant creature and seeing nothing extraordinary the minister says in latin to the knight nondum audivimus spiritum loquenem presently a voice comes out of the womans mouth audis loquentem audis loquentem this put the minister into some amazement which i think made him not mind his own latin he took off his hat and said misereur ds peccatoris the voice presently out of the womans mouth said dic peccatricis dic peccatricis whereupon both of them came out of the house fully satisfied took horse immediately and returned to my fathers house at thirlestane castle in lauderdale where they related this passage this i do exactly remember many more particulars might be got in that country but this latin criticism in a most illiterate ignorant woman where there was no pretense to dispossessing is evidence enough i think so far the lord lauderdale  this leads us to consider another assertion of dr bekkers where he says that all the possessions mentioned in the scriptures were but incurable diseases that tormented men the devil having nothing to do in them and of which christ cured many persons by his sole word  as to this gulielmus adera physician of tolouse printed a book there ann      concerning the diseases and diseased cured by christ in the third part of this book he enquires how the devil becomes the external cause of many diseases  he there tells us that those persons whom christ cured were such as the interpreters of the scriptures call energumens or such as were possessed with an evil spirit concerning whom it is a crime to doubt nay he says those strive and contend against all truth faith experience and the authority of most wise and pious men who obstinately deny those energumens and persons obsest and possessed with the devil and set naught by of the vexatious power the devil has in moving natural causes and if the obsest do any thing excessively violent or stupendous believe it to be and ascribe it to melancholy preternaturally moved in the brain or the whole body these men bring it so to pass that by understanding they understand nothing who exploding the power of demons accuse all ancient writers and all the fathers of the christian church whose negligence he should rather choose to imitate than the unaccountable diligence of those men  to distinguish persons possessed from those infested with a melancholic enthusiasm he says the learned physician massaria gives two signs which are most certain marks of a demoniacal seizure first if a rustic or idiot speaks greek or latin secondly if he predicts future things now it is not to be doubted but these things have been often observed in melancholic persons by levinus lemnius and others in lib fern de abd rer cas riolanus brings reasons for it and an instance in philaretus of spoletto who being infested with worms fell into a new kind of madness so that in his disease he spoke very well the german tongue huartus in his scrutinium ingeniorum tells us of a woman seized with a frenzy in a great fever who spoke latin and predicted many things as a prophet she predicted to a surgeon who let her blood that he would die within a month and that his wife would after marry a neighbor smith which fell out accordingly psellus also tells us of a woman who being ill after childbearing spoke in the armenian tongue with a certain armenian physician though she had never seen an armenian before and knew nothing but her chamber and distaffe  he thinks every man knows it to be a great and difficult task to distinguish melancholic persons from such as are possessed no man as far as he knows having as yet given us true marks of it he says therefore that a man must inspect the nature manners humors and disposition of the diseased what he does beside the usual nature of the disease and of the nature of its symptoms as to cry out violently to be vehemently agitated and tortured to contract wrest or extend his limbs without a manifest convulsion to be delirious without a frenzy to speak prodigious things and use an unusual tongue in short to do or suffer those things which are very unusual in diseases  these things being discovered as far as a physician may he must explain how the devil becomes the cause of diseases how he acts with natural causes entangles the body in distempers stirs up symptoms with such enormity that it may be justly doubted whether it be a monstrous disease or a severe demon and he concludes with the unanimous assertion of divines and physicians that it is done by the devils managing of the humors at his pleasure in those that are left to him whereby he can cause an epilepsie palsy and the like diseases as also blindness deafness etc  if any one wonders why he awakens and stirs up fits of diseases according to the motion and quarters of the moon he says it is because at that time the humors being increased by the motion and influence of the moon are more conveniently agitated  and in his   th chapter of his said third part treating concerning the difference of an epilepsie from a divine exstasie and that which proceeds from the devil he says a divine exstasie is a sacred rapt of the mind in which god by a condescent presents himself to any humane creature not by the means of any disease or other preternatural morbifick cause the doctrine of divines being that god insinuates himself into our minds by a rapt and then shows us by a divine representation those things he pleases we shall see therefore it is really god who forcibly draws man to him by an exstasie no natural cause nor the mind spontaneously moved for as the sun is not seen without the sun so neither can god be known without god  if you had seen the prophets or others rapt in exstacies you would have been apt to say they were fallen into an apoplectick or epileptick seizure for they remained immovable their eyes open and fixed toward heaven their faces pale either standing upright or being on their knees till being filled with the light of celestial visions and saturated with a feast of holy thoughts they returned to themselves but it is easy to distinguish these from epileptical persons and we shall show that extatical persons and such as are rapt by a demon are not epileptical  christian divines and physicians agree that demons stir up raptures and exstasies in men binding or loosing the exterior senses and that either stopping the pores of the brain that the spirits do not pass forth as it is done naturally by sleep or by recalling the sensitive spirits from the outward senses to the inward organs which he there retains so the devil renders women witches exstatical and magicians who while they lie fast asleep in one place being deceived they think they have been in various places and done many things  that these exstasies are not epileptick seisures it appears from bodin in his theater of universal nature where he says that those that are rapt by the devil feel neither stripes nor cuttings nor no wresting of their limbs nor burning torches nor the burning of a red hot iron nay nor is the beat of the pulse nor the motion of the heart perceived in them but afterward returning to themselves they feel most bitter pains of the wounds received and tell of things that were done at  00 miles distance and affirm themselves to have seen them done so far bodin  an exstasie therefore is an abolishment of sense and motion and not a depravation of it as in an epileptick seizure for persons in an exstasie lie wholly immovable in an epileptick fit they are most violently agitated and as bodin says demoniacal exstaticks breath forth an horrid stink epilepticks foam at the mouth and their seed and excrements pass from them through a violent agitation of the muscles and infinite evils which demoniacks commit in their raptures show that they were not agitated with a convulsion but gave themselves too much to the devils covenants nor need i say much concerning the difference betwixt a madness a syncope and a stupor caused by narcotick medicines and an exstasie for as bodin rightly argues a mad man is always agitated without ceasing and a man rapt in an exstasie lies immovable destitute of all sense and motion of all his parts and rather like a man seized with an apoplexy a syncope is a sudden failing of all the strength and soon ends in death or a recovery an exstasie lasts a long time without the loss of a mans strength a stupor caused by narcotick medicines takes away sense not motion for otherwise motion being abolished together with sense death would be at hand therefore a stupor is not exstasie so far dr ader  to this i may add inst med l   p   sec   c   what sennertus writes of the demoniacal sopor of witches who think they are carried through the air dance feast have copulation with the devil and do other things in their sleep and afterward believe the same things waking now he says whether they are really so carried in the air etc or being in a profound sleep only dream they are so carried and persist in that opinion after they are awake these facts or dreams cannot be natural for it cannot be that there should be so great an agreement in dreams of persons differing in place temperament age sex and studies that in one night and at the same hour they should dream of one such meeting and should clearly agree of the place number and quality of the persons and the like circumstances but such dreams are suggested from a supernatural cause viz from the devil to his confederates god permitting it whence also to those witches seriously converted and refusing to be longer present at those meetings such dreams no longer happen which is a mark that they proceeded not before from a natural cause  schottus in his book de mirabilibs energumenorum gives us some signs for knowing daemoniacks and first he says a revealing of occult things which surpass the natural knowledge of the revealers is a probable sign of a possession unless we may rationally presume it to be from god or a good angel and this because since that revealing must necessarily be suggested from some mind or spirit and it is not from the private spirit of the man since it surpasses his natural knowledge nor from god or a good spirit as it is prudently supposed of necessity it must proceed from an evil spirit he says it is a probable sign not certain since that revealing may be caused by demons not possessing a person as it appears by many histories but if there are other signs it is a presumption that the revealing in the said circumstances is from a daemoniacal possession  secondly he says a skill in and speaking of unknown tongues which the speaker never learnt is also a probable sign of a possession if it may not otherwise be rationally presumed that it is from god or a good angel because it cannot naturally be that a person ignorant of a tongue should speak it since we learn not foreign tongues but with great labor the same is to be understood of the knowledge of reading writing singing and of the knowledge of other sciences if a person had never learnt them levinus lemnius therefore lies under a mistake where he tells us that melancholic persons and such as are in a frenzy through a fervent ebullition of the humors and a vehement agitation of the spirits may speak various languages though before they knew nothing of them schottus there sets forth many other signs of daemoniacks though not so certain as the former and he sets forth also the signs given by voetius and others of them for which i refer you to his book  this i think is enough in answer to dr bekkers assertion that the devil has nothing to do in diseases  as for the cavils of many writers against the possibility of a covenanting witch i am thoroughly convinced that if an apparition presents itself to any person as many have to my self if that person be fallen from god and sunk into despair through the miseries of human life having not that christian armor on which st paul speaks of he may make a covenant with him as well as with a man and if they say there can be no covenant with a spirit how comes it that there has has been a covenant betwixt god and man  there is one point of dr bekkers doctrine which remains to be answered where he says if we think to fright people with specter to teach them so much the more to love god it is a miserable thing in christianity that people must be brought to god by a servile fear instead of love  now this seems not to me so extraordinary a lesson in divinity for as we know the love of god to be the consummation of wisdom so the fear of god is the beginning of it and i think a servile fear still necessary to the generality of mankind for parents have rods for their children masters for their scholars princes for their subjects and though all three would persuade those under them to do what they are enjoined for love yet such generally is the reluctance of humane nature from doing what is enjoined it through an exorbitancy of our passions that till these are broken by a christian or philosophical training or we are come to a clearness of judgment by a long practice and experience in the affairs of humane life love alone will not do and the servile fear of those rods must be upheld and the scriptures teach us that we must be content with the bond woman for a while till we may deserve to marry the free woman  thus i think i have sufficiently answered what has been stated from dr bekker but there is one thing remains for me to take notice of in him in his fourth volume he has taken upon him to examine the proofs that are brought from experience for the existence and operations of demons and to refute them i have intimated before how groundlesly he has there rejected the demons of tedworth and mascon and here i shall observe how he rejects what is said of the piper at hamelin he tells us that his master schookius has refuted that story in his little book in latin entitled fabula hamelensis of whose reasons he leaves the reader to judge and adds many suggestions of his own against it  part   sec    now frommannus in his third book of magical fsination after having given us the relation of this piper de praeser dm c    as it is set down by kircher and schottus and after having told us that wierus says this story is entered in the public records of the town and painted in the church windows of which himself was an eye witness and that the magistrate there was wont to date the public acts from the year of the going forth of their children together with the year of christ and that its observed even to this day in mark of the fact that the sound of a timbrel is never admitted in that street by which the boys went forth if any bride haply be led forth that way till she be gone forth nor is dancing permitted there i say after having set forth this he says that martin schookius strongly endeavored in a peculiar little book to rank this story among fabulous relations but theo kirchmeierus egregiously shammed all his effort in a peculiar disputation at witteberg anno       now dr bekker has not been so candid as to take notice of this in frommannus as he ought to have done he having read frommannus as it appears by his quoting him in his  th volume c    i could add much more against dr bekker but this shall suffice at present  and now before i make an end in regard that in the front of my book i have promised some account of my particular experience as to a sensible perception of spirits perhaps it may be expected from me that i should set forth some more particulars than i have yet done concerning it as to this i shall only say that in regard i do not urg my own experience as argumentative for proving the existency of spirits and their operations i think it may be looked upon as a thing of more curiosity than use to enlarge upon it though i shall add the following particulars relating to it  i declare then with all the sincerity of a christian that it never so much as entered into my thoughts to use any practice for raising or calling spirits as some men have done and that when they came it was altogether a surprise to me at their first coming they did not appear to me nor come into my chamber but kept at my chamber windows and in a court adjoining to one of my chamber windows and in a garden adjoining to another window they called to me sung played on music rung bells sometimes crowed like cocks etc and i have great reason to believe these to be all good spirits for i found nothing in them tending to ill their drift in coming as far as i could perceive being only to compose my mind and to bring it to its highest purity they used no threats to me but the surprise kept always a terror upon me and they continued with me about two months  their second coming to me was some years after when at first there came five as i have set forth in my fourth chapter and presently after there came hundreds and i saw some of them dance in a ring in my garden and sing holding hands round not facing each other but their backs turned to the inner part of the circle i found these of a promiscuous nature some good and some bad as among men for some of them would now and then curse and swear and talk loosely and others would reprehend them for it yet none of these ever persuaded me to any ill thing but all would dissuade me from drinking too freely and any other irregularity and if at any time i was upon going to any neighboring town they would tell me they would go with me which i found they did for they would there call at my curtain by my beds side as they usually did at my house and talk to me  beside these two great visitations they have come to me now and then for some years and sometimes have stayed with me a week sometimes two or three days and all along from their first coming they have very often suggested things to me in my dreams as now and then they do still at their first coming i heard no name of any of them mentioned as i did at their second coming i had a perception of them by four of my senses for i saw them heard them and three of them had a dark smoke coming out of their mouths which seemed somewhat offensive to the smell it being like the smoke of a lamp and three of them bid me take them by the hand which i did but it yielded to my touch so that i could not find any sensible resistency in it neither could i perceive any coldness in them as it is said some apparitions have had i did not ask them many curious questions as i find many men think i should and as they say they would have done but i always kept me on my guard and still required them to be gone and would not enter into such familiarily with them indeed i asked them once what creatures they were and they told me they were an order of creatures superior to mankind and could influence our thoughts and that their habitation was in the air i asked them also several things relating to my own concerns in this world and i found sometimes both in their answers and in what they suggested in my dreams things very surprising to me one of them lay down upon my bed by me every night for a considerable time and pretended great kindness to me and if some others at any time would threaten me that spirit told me they should do me no hurt  if you ask me whether i really think these apparitions to be spirits or only an effect of melancholy i can only say what st paul said of the nature of his rapture god knows i know not but they appeared to me real  tandlerus in his dissertation concerning melancholy tells us that the affect of melancholy chiefly happens to persons from the fortieth to the sixtieth year of their age and that it is contracted chiefly in the summer and autumn and comes to an head in the spring and i must own that i was above forty years of age before any thing in this kind happened to me but it was about christmas that the apparitions came to me both times  as for melancholy i know not whether my temperament may have some allay of it but i think i carry more of a sanguine indeed there was this that might help to exalt the other when they first came to me i was just upon a recovery from an intermittent fever which had held me above twelve months and i confess at that time i was unfortunately involved in an unnatural suit in law with a too near relation which might somewhat discompose my mind and at the spirits second coming that suit in law was continued and i cannot say but at that time i might have been somewhat affected by that saying of the wise man prove    si dedas te vino oculi tui videbunt extraneas nempe visiones and mirabiles apparitiones as lavaterus explains it de spect l   c   but it is much if such an occasion should cause them to continue then with me above three months  i could add many more particulars of what passed betwixt the spirits and my self for indeed i kept a journal of it for some years as well for what passed in my dreams as otherwise but i shall forbear to trouble the reader farther only adding that as these visitations of spirits gave me an occasion to consider how far humane reason could bear as to a making out of the existence of spirits and their operations so i must declare i firmly believe that as the whole visible world has proceeded from the invisible world which will hold good even according to the epicurean doctrine so that spirits both good and bad are concerned in the administration of it as agents subordinate to the first cause and this i adhere to as well by a medium of reason as that of faith in which i think we are all bound to acquiesce and it appears plain enough to me that those that will not so do will but lose themselves in a vertiginous doxomania and never center in any solid truth  a postscript having lately had the honor to hear a relation of an apparition from the lord bishop of gloucester and it being too late for me to insert it in its proper place in this book i give it you here by way of postscript as follows  sir charles lee by his first lady had only one daughter of which she died in childbirth and when she was dead her sister the lady everard desired to have the education of the child and she was by her very well educated till she was marriageable and a match was concluded for her with sir william perkins but was then prevented in an extraordinary manner upon a thursday night she thinking she saw a light in her chamber after she was in bed knocked for her maid who presently came to her and she asked why she left a candle burning in her chamber the maid said she left none and there was none but what she brought with her at that time then she said it was the fire but that her maid told her was quite out and said she believed it was only a dream whereupon she said it might be so and composed her self again to sleep but about two of the clock she was awakened again and saw the apparition of a little woman between her curtain and her pillow who told her she was her mother that she was happy and that by twelve of the clock that day she should be with her whereupon she knokd again for her maid called for her clothes and when she was dressed went into her closet and came not out again till nine and then brought out with her a letter sealed to her father brought it to her aunt the lady everard told her what had happened and desired that as soon as she was dead it might be sent to him but the lady thought she was suddenly fallen mad and thereupon sent presently away to chelmsford for a physician and surgeon who both came immediately but the physician could discern no indication of what the lady imagined or of any indisposition of her body notwithstanding the lady would needs have her let blood which was done accordingly and when the young woman had patiently let them do what they would with her she desired that the chaplain might be called to read prayers and when prayers were ended she took her gittar and psalm book and sat down upon a chair without arms and played and sung so melodiously and admirably that her musickmaster who was then there admired at it and near the stroke of twelve she rose and sat her self down in a great chair with arms and presently fetching a strong breathing or two immediately expired and was so suddenly cold as was much wondered at by the physician and surgeon she dyed at waltham in essx three miles from chelmsford and the letter was sent to sir charles at his house in warwickshire but he was so afflicted with the death of his daughter that he came not till she was buried but when he came caused her to be taken up and to be buried by her mother at edminton as she desired in her letter this was about the year      or    and this relation the lord bishop of gloucester had from sir charles lee himself  finis
