an essay at removing national prejudices against a union with scotland  to be continued during the treaty here  part i  london printed in the year   0   an essay at removing national prejudices etc hitherto all the tracts i have seen upon the subject of the union serve only to two ends  either historically to relate what has been done toward a union in other and former treaties with the particular obstructions on either side  or to debate the present question what sort of union is most proper for the nations at this time  the several authors have done so much on the first of these that nothing is wanting to be added to their work and on the second their reasonings are many on both sides which i shall abridge first and then perhaps add something farther which may not be useless in the case and which as a column erected on a prepared pedestal may rise up to a complete form agreeable in order and beauty to the design  it is in vain to commence a treaty of union and which must after be referred to the great collected councils on either side while national aversions remain unmoved and immortal prejudices fill the minds of the people  these are the mountains which must be levelled to make smooth this valley of peace and this is the fever in the blood which till it is abated and the inflammation carried off the great national wound can never be cured  a temper to peace must be found or if not found must be formed in hoth nations as the great preliminary to this treaty and without which it will be in vain to enter upon the greater articles of it  if this be wanting to what purpose does the queen invite the parliament prepare and commissioners meet other than to furnish authors to complete their historical accounts of what has been to little purpose attempted toward a union  and yet i am not speaking here of the temper of the commissioners on either hand with respect to union i make no question but they come on both sides heartily inclined to the thing in general i wish them as sincerely agreing in the methods  but as what they do is to be recommended to and laid before the parliaments of both kingdoms whose members without any reflection on them may be variously influenced from causes too many to repeat here and on whom the ancient prejudices of the times may have made too large impressions  for these reasons i cannot but think it is necessary to essay the removing those prejudices in the best manner i can as a thing no man has yet attempted and as what is absolutely necessary to the great work we are upon  i believe i may be allowed to say without any charge of partiality or affectation to our selves or of our real merit that there are not two braver nations in the world or that have more shown their courage and gallantry upon all occasions than the english and the scots  and as these two people inhabit one island neither separated by dangerous seas or unpassible mountains neither bounded with vast deserts or great rivers by which either the communications of peace and trade or the access of war might be rendered difficult the onlooking world has beheld with no less wonder than pleasure that they have not to this day been able to unite in one body  their wonder must needs arise from its being the apparent interest of both nations long since to have joined hands to their mutual interest and to have joined their force to their mutual strength and defense no nations in europe whom nature had seemed to prepare for such a union and laid up in store so many visible advantages of uniting being to be supposed so blind to their real interests without great scandal even to their understandings or at least to their temper it cannot but have seemed strange to all the nations of the world who see into the vast advantages of a union to both these kingdoms that they themselves who have neither of them been counted among the foolishest nations of the world should not see it also and that so many revolutions of state and of years as have passed over their heads so many afflicting circumstances war blood devastation and destruction have not yet been able to make them wise to their own peace and show them even by the contrary the necessity as well as the profit of a firm union between them such as may for ever shut the door against the fatal invasions depredations and terrible eruption of blood and war which with but small intermissions have alternately afflicted both kingdoms  nor has it been without some secret satisfaction that our neighbors have observed this especially those of them as have either envied or apprehended the addition of strength such a union would be to these nations and the formidable increase it would be to the britannick power it cannot but have been very pleasing to the french and spanish governments with whom we have been at open wars to observe how the national animosities between the english and scots have always kept them embroiled and by spending their native fury terrible to them upon one another prevented the mischiefs and lessened the powers of the english especially which they had reason to fear might have otherwise been too formidable for them to oppose  it would be too tedious here to recite the innumerable instances how the divisions of these nations have assisted to the rising glory of our neighbors and he that has not read how france under charles the dauphin afterward charles the viith when by the conquest of henry the vth she was almost entirely subjected to the english recovered her self chiefly by the valor and assistance of the scots must not pass with me for a historian  had scotland been then united to england and the thirty thousand scots which at sundry times went over to assist that dejected prince been sent thither to join the english armies then under the brave duke of bedford regent of france and the best generals england ever saw france had for ought we know been entirely subjected to the english power and britain had given law to all these parts of the world  t would be endless to trace antiquity and bring upon the stage the very many instances when scotland has had the fate of england in her hand and again when england has put the yoke upon the neck of the scots power the only useful observation from which to the present purpose is how these alternate advantages over one another have tended to the weakening both and by a chain of disasters has helped to reduce us both to the present condition and danger of being overpowered by our too potent neighbors who had these nations been long ago united under prudent and politic measures had perhaps been always kept too low to have looked us in the face  now disaster begins to make us wise and though the steps both nations have made toward union have been very slow yet it is a long time since they both saw it their interest and have expressed a willingness to bring it to pass  whether providence for ends yet unknown to us or the nature of things has retarded it so long is not for me to determine but very small have been the beginnings and progress of this willingness to unite  the first step toward a common courtesy between the nations was in the marriage of the lady elizabeth daughter of henry the viith to james the fourth king of scotland and it is remarkable that wise prince was the first in england that foresaw an advantage to england by a union with scotland the particulars of which we find noted in history viz that when the match was proposed in council it met with great opposition there from an apprehension that one time other such an alliance might bring the crown of england into the line of scotland  and what is it should says that wise prince with a spirit one would think had been prophetical if any such thing should happen i foresee that it will come to pass that our kingdom of england will lose nothing thereby because there will not be an accession of england to scotland but on the contrary of scotland to england as to that is by much the more noble head of the whole island vide speeds chron reign of henry the viith  had any man been by the king that had known what we now come by length of time to understand they might have added but it will be the certain depressing and ruin of scotland by removing her court and gentry by losing the concourse of strangers residence of ambassadors and consequently the expense of money and the helps to trade from her capital city by lessening her interest in foreign courts and her value in the world with innumerable mischiefs attending the meanness of a kingdom without a head  that scotland by this means would rather seem a province than a kingdom and yet remain without the proper advantages of a province of england also as being treated like aliens in every thing injurious and detrimental to england and as subjects in every thing advantageous to england though prejudicial to scotland  from this relative union with scotland under henry viith a settled peace with scotland began and saving some short intervals under henry the viiith from a mere capricio of that warm prince the long peace between the nations seemed to prepare them on both sides for more strict engagements by wearing out the remembrance of former injuries and lessening the native animosities of the people  since this we have had four conjunctures in which the oser union we are now to treat about has been in some more than common manner entered upon and which i may say were especially proper to have brought it to pass    the first under king edward the vi when the protestant religion being just settled here england courted her siser scotland to join hands and become one family under that good prince it was the first juncture that we read of that england was governed by a young unmarryd king and scotland by a young unmarryd queen at the same time nothing was so natural as that by marriage the kingdom would become one in the next blood of both races  the english made the offer first in henry the viiiths time and now renewed it and the contempt the scots seemed to show of it and which appeared to be the faction of the popish party fearing the reformation provoked the english to a war in which the scots were overthrown in the great battle at pink or muscelburgh  twas at this time the famous declaration was emitted by the duke of somerset the english general when though he was conqueror he told the scots he came not to conquer them but unite with them and to offer them all the advantages of the english amity some of the most significant expressions of which declaration are such as these  we conquer and yet we propose peace we gain victory by war and we offer amity and friendship by peace we seek not conquest but alliance that you may be united in all things with us in marriage in trade and all the advantages of a lasting amity if any man please to read the said declaration at large too long to be incerted here he will easily see that age had quite different thoughts from us concerning a treaty with scotland that they knew a possession of conquest would never keep scotland and that union not victory was the common interest of this nation  but the scots then could not see their interest the power of popish councils prevailed upon them and for fear of reformation they rejected the just advantages to the state and sent away the queen privately to france  the next turn was more effectual and this was at the coming of king james the vith of scotland to the crown of england the prophetic expressions quoted before from the mouth of henry the viith were now come to pass and the crown of england devolved upon the house of scotland had k james done justice to his native country had he thought of their future prosperity in short had he thought of any thing but neglecting his own kingdom and suppressing the true interest of it  it was without doubt absolutely in his power to have brought an entire union to pass and to have ended all the difficulties disputes and quarrels that afterward embroiled these kingdoms in bloody wars to their mutual ruin and destruction but as there were people and parties then to be found who envied and perhaps feared the public tranquillity so there has never since wanted a succeeding race to inherit their rancour and who on all occasions blow the coals of dissaffection between the two nations  how the good endeavors of those people who at the death of queen elizabeth labored hard to begin the new reign with a union of nations came to be defeated and the further prosecution of it dropped how king james forgetting the true interest of his country instead of gratifying the scots with what might have been for the general good of the kingdom only brought a long train of them hither who gaping for preferment and equally neglecting their own country served only to make the english jealous and uneasy and consequently averse to uniting these are stories too tedious and too remote to engage in here it is enough to leave it to posterity that the thing was attempted but ill persued the blessed healing juncture being reserved to an opportunity yet to come  how after this the scots differed with k charles the is it on his attempt to impose the english service book upon them how they came to a pacification without blood or with but a little how afterward they fully paid the ill treatment of the father k james upon the son whose ruin their army then entering england completed by turning the scale of the kings affairs and overballancing his forces at the great battle at marstonmoor i leave for those gentlemen to consider who upon all occasions are for reckoning the scots for nothing in their calculations and thinking they merit no regard in the general account of the strengths of europe  in the interval of affairs here under the parliament and o cromwell we find a real union between the kingdoms carried on to a kind of settlement though something imperfect but whoever contrived it such a settlement it was as had the next government thought fit to have built upon it might have risen up to all the parts of a complete union but this dyed with the times and the constitution of scotland returned to its full exercise under king charles the iid    at the revolution under king william i must own the scots had the fairest opportunity of perfecting the thing that perhaps they will ever again be trusted with  the english affairs were then in that condition that i cannot but say the scots might have almost forced it upon us if they would there could have been hardly any article in the matters of trade or government which the crown of england would not have been in a manner very free to give up to secure the scots then in the interest of the new established government which for some time twas expected they would waver in whether the scots in the so speedy concession and falling in with the english settlement did not show more generosity than discretion and whether they have been gratefully treated for it since i purposely omit because being to treat of a union of the two kingdoms with design to prepare both sides for it i would p up no old sores nor bring to remembrance any thing that should tend to prepossess either nation against the other  this opportunity has been lost and now the last juncture perhaps that ever may offer it self for the closing this mortal breach seems to appear  what steps were made toward it or rather from it in a late commission and seeming treaty i also purposely omit and though the umbrage taken here at the scots act of security the preposterous lav made here which was in its nature a declaration of war the marching troops to the north fortifying of hull and the like are things merit some satyr yet they who consider this nation then under the influence of a party and of such a party as were especially known by their aversion to scotland as well as to union in general will easily forget these things as the remains of a temper always destructive to the good of both kingdoms and as indications only that this was not the proper season for a union  but time and the consequences of things have brought both the nations to more healing measures and england now under the influence of better counsels has thought fit to show the scots their forwardness to take away all just pretenses from those people that willingly lay hold of them to widen the breaches of the nations in order to this the parliament has rescinded and abrogated that act which gave such offense to the scots and without which they had declared they could not treat and i cannot but observe that the scots not putting the notice they took of that act into their bill in parliament but into an address to the queen  and the english parliament voluntarily repealing the act which was injurious to scotland in order to make way for this treaty seems to be two healing steps and such mutual advances as gives great encouragement to those people who hope for a good issue of the present treaty by these things those people were entirely disappointed who waiting for an advantage ov the scots laid hold of the case of green and his crew exaggerating and exclaiming against the pretended injustice of those executions as a sufficient ground of a national quarrel though at the same time there were two scots hanged to one english man and those condemned by the ordinary forms of justice and legal process in which the forgot that had they all been english men and had after appeared to be perfectly innocent yet that as a nation the scots can be answerable for no more than giving persons a fair and legal trial according to the ordinary course of justice under which if unhappy circumstances invol d them and they fell yet by the law of nations no public blame can by this be fixed upon the scots nor any pretense of a quarrel be justly raised upon that foundation  i know now nothing to hinder the good issue and conclusion of the present treaty no cloud upon the prospect of the success of it nothing to apprehend so much from real as imaginary difficulties that are raised and kept alive by those that really are afraid so great a blessing should befall this nation  in order therefore to remove the mists and vapors of imagination from the eyes of the people and prepare mens minds for union the design of this work is to remove the prejudices settled or that seem to be settled in the minds of the common people of both nations against each other that a union of the nations may as already it is to all wise men be really desirable to both sides  as this is what no man has yet attempted i hope it may be an acceptable thing to both sides and may open our eyes to a second article viz the advantage of a union to both the nations  and having in this tract gone through these heads i shall in the subsequent part of the work examine a little the terms of a union remove the difficulties expose the artifice of those that form objections from needless fears and jealousies show how a union may be made without any danger to or clashing in the interests of the established churches of or the tolerated dissenters in either nation clear up their eyesight who cannot see the interest of their native country and so go on to state the fact in such proper schemes of eternal peace as may backed with the wisdom of both nations terminate in the lasting tranquillity and visible increase of the power wealth and magnificence of the most powerful island in the world   st in removing the prejudice on both sides i cannot but observe there is a manifest difference in such things as these and a difference which more than ordinarily influences the success of such an action between coming to a treaty willing designing and prepared to remove difficulties and bring the thing it self to a happy conclusion and on the other hand coming prepared to raise difficulties cavil dispute and embarrass a treaty that in time may end in a rupture vanish into air and come to nothing  national prejudices are some of the worst sort of humane antipathies and as they may be applied have frequently very bad effects and i cannot clear the english from the just charge of being the nation in the world the most addicted to them and when once they have entertained such unhappy notions are the hardest of any nation in the world to be brought off from them again though i hope they will not be so influenced here  it is too long a work here to examine this particular or to give originals for inbred antipathies of nations to say why the wild ungoverned irish that mortally hate the very name of an english man and have often with the utmost barbarity murdered thousands of our people in cold blood are less hated by us than the dutch between whom and this nation mutual engagements and national kindnesses have frequently passed to the common advantage of both why the french between whom and this nation frequent terrible and bloody wars have often happened are more respected than the scots who inhabit the same terra firma natives of the same island allied by intermarriages both in kings nobility and common people and who live among one another trade together speak the same language prosess the same protestant religion and confederated together by a relative union under the same head  it is true former wars invasions and depredation on either side have laid the foundation of these animoties which it is impossible to say which nation has acted with  blame blood devastation all sorts of cruelties br  fa honor and the laws of nations have been too common on both sides and that action of king edward the iii though otherwise a glorious prince in hanging up the two sons of the brave governor of berwick given as hostages for the surrender of the town if not relieved before such a time only because he would not give up the town before the time was expired is a thing so detestable in its kind and such a blot to the memory of that great conqueror that if there were no other things to be mentioned against us we ought for ever to be silent as to former reproaches an action so horrid that their own mother filled with indigation at the barbarity came to her husband and entreated him not to betray his country into the hands of so cruel an enemy to save her children justly arguing that after he had thus broke his faith with them in the case of her children what honor could they expect from him in the rest that her sons would die with honor and be an eternal infamy to the memory of the cruel mutherer that god might give them more children but their country once betrayed could never be recovered one would therefore think time should now race out the remembrance of these things on both sides and since the injuries of war were always reciprocal and the scots had perhaps as much to complain of as we it seems strange the seeds of that ancient strife should remain now the generations concerned are removed out of the way and the several occasions of those animosities are absolutely buried in the grave of time never to be revived but by the most unaccountable folly and madness this age can be guilty of  but not to enter too far back upon the ungrateful task of examining our forefathers miscarriages i shall come to the present national prejudices which i think seem to prepare the minds of the people with unhappy aversions to union and these i take to be such as follow  i on our side against the scots for   st their share in the last civil war as to this i can only say it is too long a quarrel to decide here and merits on all sides to be buried in oblivion since take it from beginning to end the scots suffered deeply had their share in the blood and ruin of their kingdom and at last suffered almost an entire reduction to england for attempting to restore our monarchy of which by it self  as to the vulgar mob charge of selling the king which ignorant people and no other reproach them with it is needless to enter into the history of it but refer the objector to these few observations    they had no power to have protected his majesty or to defend themselves against an inevitable war with england which with a potent and victorious army threatened to fall upon them if they had carried the king away    they were under no ties of obligation to the king as a prisoner taken they were in arms against him and he came and put himself into their hands to their great surprise which is a yielding at discretion and by the law of arms left them at liberty to dispose of him as they thought fit and his majesty was sensible the necessity of their affairs made it impossible for them to detain him unless they would immediately have come over to his cause which they could not do nor did the king expect they would having been in arms against it    nor did they take any money as a price for the king only agreed to depart and deliver the king who they durst not keep and capitulated to have the money paid them which was due from the parliament to them before    and lastly nor did they part with the king without making articles with the english in his behalf that they should treat him with freedom honor and safety which articles if they had been kept the king had been a gainer by what the scots did on his behalf and if these agreements were after broken and the king ill treated it is the english must answer for that not the scots who not only complained of it but resented it so highly that they took arms against the parliament on that very score to revenge his death and made great attempts to restore his son even to their own ruin and the subversion of their constitution  so that doing justice this prejudice is absolutely groundless and unreasonable and seems to be raised upon the scots only to extenuate what some people sell into with respect to that prince and can therefore leave no just reproach upon the scots who it is evident by the ruin they brought upon themselves in endeavoring to restore the son were no way capable of defending the father  whether then shall we come for a prejudice against the scots the most significant objection we have against uniting with them is that they are presbyterians and what if they were papists are differences in opinion incompatible with union how do we see the numbers of roman catholics in holland no manner of obstruction to the union of the provinces the popish and protestant cantons of the swiss united in a perpetual confederacy all the prejudices that arise from this suggestion amount to no more than this not that it impedes a union in the most absolute and extensive meaning at all but that it is with reluctane that they should see it  this without any injustice i call partyprejudice and now they begin to  us the danger of the church of england will be brought upon the stage again and that here will be an evident proof of it which no body can answer and we begin already to be threatened with that clamor  to remove at least the groundwork of this pretense i think it may be proper a little to enter into a history of probabilities and calculate the strength of parties here as briefly as possible  there is indeed some difference here not between author and author among our high church champions but between authors and themselves sometimes they will have the dissenters so inconsiderable a party that they can be easly suppressed and ought to be so to prevent growing mischiefs at other times the same authors will have them be so formidable that they are every day frighting their children with their running and overturning both church and state what shall we do with such people as these if it serves their turn to cry out of the danger of the church and the fatal plots of the dissenters then they are a formidable party and the government must be warned against them and the church is called upon to stand fast and quit themselves like men and the like if they find it proper to vaunt a little and insult the dissenters then they are a mean and contemptible party and not worth any bodys notice  upon this uncertainty it is evident there can no just calculation be made from these peoples judgments but let us come to the case  if we come to unite say these gentlemen the presbyterian power of scotland joined to the dissenters in england will be too strong for the church and we shall be overwhelmed by the party and the church destroyed  let us see if the reverse of this be not most probable it is the general opinion that as to numbers the dissenters in england set against the church are not more than one to twelve as to wealth and interest in trade they are allowed to be much more but as to numbers it is all wise mens opinion that one in twelve is the outside in scotland by the same general calculations the episcopal party who i now call dissenters are at least accounted to now though the whole number of scots were joined to the dissenters in england and were put in a balance of numbers it is certain they would fall short of being a match for the church then add their poverty to the rest which is the certain and constant destruction of great designs the church can be in no danger in point of strength if providence were to stand neuter and the arms of flesh to try it out  let no prejudices therefore fill our minds with respect to the interest of the church of england the wealth and strength of england whose government is wholly a church of england establishment is beyond all comparison superior to the power of the dissenters were they so bereaved of their senses as to attempt to disturb it  whoever therefore forms prejudices in the heads of the people of england concerning dangers to the church from this union must give me leave to say it is done with a sinister des gn against the public peace of both nations and without any manner of foundation grounded either upon reason truth or the nature of things  not but that there are other reasons to prove that the church of england can take no umbrage from this union which are drawn from the interests of each nation and from the circumstances of the scots which i omit here as not to this purpose  but when we consult the article of mere strength there is no shadow of danger to the church from the union but what at the same time will hold good to make us fear an entire conquest of this nation by the scots without a union which they will allow to be ridiculous  if i was to turn the argument i confess i cannot speak with the same assurance that there is the same safety to the scots in the case of their uniting with so powerful a government as the church of england establishment in this nation what an encroaching party here may not attempt or at least what they would not attempt if the sacred postulata of this union should not be backed with the protection of the government i will not answer for but the security of the public faith will have some reasons besides the honety of such a cause to protect the scots in all their just rights of which i shall speak by it self  i cannot imagine why it should remain as a prejudice in the minds of the people of either nation that they differ in some articles of religion since a general uniformity in religious matters is not so much as hoped for in this nation and can really justify the prejudices against the scots no more than it does our own unnatural divisions one among another  the difference in both nations is not of religion but in religious circumstances both are protestant both orthodox in principle and equally opposite to popery and antichristianism the establishments of either nation have no manner of occasion to interfere and an alternate toleration might easily make a reconciliation of charity be universal  how foolish then must national prejudices be and how much to our own detriment as well as to the encouragement of the enemies of both nations in that they tend to keep disunited two nations whose divisions have been the destruction of so many hundred thousand brave stout fellows whose force employed against foreign nations might have made britain mistress of half the nations of europe  ii the next rank of prejudices is of the scots side against us  these are such as our possessing their sovereign removing their court oppressing their trade neglecting them in our public treaties excluding them in advantages as aliens and using them as natives in cases to their loss ruining their collony in daten seizing their east india ships and the like  of these i only say in general as they are the proper reasons why the scots should desire this union so they cannot prejudice them against it because by a union they will be all removed and in the pursuit of this work i shall undertake to show how they may be removed to the general satisfaction of both nations  i know there are prejudices relating to trade and some people have entertained opinions of the scots ruining us and enriching themselves by encroachments upon our trade but if i make it appear that a freedom of trade is our advantage more than the scots that the scots have been oppressed by us in trade and that though they shall grow rich it shall be also our advantage i shall then effectually remove this prejudice of which by it self  and this leads me of course to examine the advantages of this union on the mistakes of which farther prejudices are grounded and though i cannot enter into the particular and separate advantages till i come to examine the heads of commerce and the relative consequences with respect to one another and with respect to our neighbors yet i cannot but a little consider the general advantages which both nations shall obtain in the conclusion of this happy union in order to open peoples eyes to their own felicity and to move our posterity to bless us for putting an end to the ruinous distempers of both nations  i am not ignorant that in all cases it is natural for men to examine what benefit what advantage shall fall to them by every thing they undertake nor is any man that has considered or discourse d in england of this union ignorant that s labored very diligently by some men to fill our common peoples mouths with this question  what shall we we englishmen get by it we dont doubt but scotland shall be the better by it by being let into our trade and let into our manufactures and let into all the advantages of an englishman but what shall we get by it  if then the ensuing sheets open this scene to the view of the people and prove to the common understanding that the advantages of this union shall be greater to england than to scotland it must of course reconcile all unprejudiced impartial people to the union in general and this inference i purpose shall run through every head of the ensuing discourse  and first after which if i was name no more it was sufficient to move us all to desire this union above all national blessings the inestimable advantage of general peace a settled a perpetual peace a final end of depredation ruin devastation and blood a national friendship succeeding the most inveterate national feuds a general tranquty following unsettled and precarious circumstances which has so often broke out into fierce and destructive wars as has at several times been supposed to cost the price of four millions of the best blood in chriendom  can either nation if in their wits say this is not a sufficient advantage to make us desire this union let us lock back to the fields of bannocksbourn  muscelborough and dunbar and  if the fountains of blood opened at those fatal places merit not to be stopped and whether it is not the wisdom of both nations to covet the preventing our posterity running into the same violence and excesses let the nobility and gentry of both nations examine the line of their families back but a few ages and see what noble branches of their ancestors spilt their blood on the desolate borders and how the bones of their noble progenitors lie buried blended with the carcasses of the common people and buried in the ditches of both countries by the hands of the conquerors  let the curious look back into history and tell me what has been the consequences to the northern countries of england from above three hundred formal invasions of the scots armies in some of which we have seen them on the banks of the humber and in others they have pierced even to the rich valleys on the trent let them describe if they know how the ruin and destruction of the country the burnings plunderings rapes and violences which in all ages are the consequences of armies ranging an open and defenseless country if they can find proper epethets for i profess my self incapable let them represent in moving and suited expressions the complaints of the distressd country the groans of the murdered innocents the cries of the widows and mothers for their husbands and children the despair of flourishing families ruined and undone with their fields over run their barns and houses plundered and burnt their cattle driven away and their whole substance destroyed  why should these things be less present with us for the circumstances being remote as to time unless we were thoroughly assured it should never fall out so again  if it were thus now or if it be possible to suppose these things acting upon the present stage of this nation if we were to suppose a scotch army entered upon the northern countries what would be the language of the inhabitants what their request to an english parliament  let him that cannot guess look back no farther than to the petition of the country in the time of king charles the is it when the scots having given the english a brush at the passage of newnham bridge possessed themselves of new castle and all the best and richest of the northern parts of england  the cry of the people was then as it would be now and as is most natural to suppose peace peace  but some say we are too strong for the scots now and there is no fear that ever they shall invade our country any mere for that our wealth and strength is so much increased that we are able to crush them presently and can always keep the war out of our own country that as we are become more powerful the scots are become weaker as we are richer they are poorer than ver and therefore the case alters  i shall speak more particularly to this when i come to examine the separate interests of both nations in which perhaps it may be necessary to make some calculations and compare circumstances and i only take leave at present to assure the judicious considering reader of these sheets that even comparing circumstances the english nation has as much or perhaps more reason to covet a lasting indissolvable peace between the nations than the scots and consequently to press for a national union as the only way effectually to bring it to pass  but i am now upon the general only in which when i speak of peace as the consequence of a general union methinks i should speak to the general understanding of every man and without examining whether we have more need of peace than the scots  let me ask a few questions    have our northern counties got any thing by the long intervals of peace which for the last   0 years has with some interruption been established between the nations let any man view the borders let them examine the rents of lands in northumberland and cumberland and tell me if they are not more than three times increased in value besides the differences in the general value of things since the battle at muscelborough    is there any different face upon the outsides of things since mutual depredations laid and kept all things waste are the scots borders waste so were ours are ours improved so might theirs be for i make no question the country north by tweed is as capable of improvement as that on the south of the same river but as the present difference is owing to to another cause i shall treat of that by it self only i say and i make no question to prove had the lands from berwick to edinburgh been under the same tenantry but under english articles of possession and leases from the landlord as the lands from berwick to new castle they would have been eq al in value both as to landlord and tenant some few mountains excepted equally fruitful and pleasant and the unhappy circumstances customs and constitution of scotland not the want of native wealth fruitfulness of soil or industrious inhabitants makes her a poor and barren nation and which it is not yet too late to recover whether this union proceed or not  general national peace therefore is a most desirable article and the greatest advantage imaginable to both nations to this to preserve what wealth they have gained and secure the flourishing condition they are arrived to to that for recovering them from the poverty and decay of their affairs to which they want nothing but freedom of circumstances and peace as the only thing which made us rise without them  if peace then shall be the consequence of this union never let any man ask me what we shall get by it we shall get the security and quiet possession of the wealth and improvements of our own country a thing which let us boast never so much of our strength will be very precarious and exposed to manifest hazards in case of a war and as our circumstances in england may be and our hands full another way as they are now may be impossible to defend  i could here enter into the inquiry of the strange unproportiond circumstances of a war if ever that unhappy time should come in england between the nations and though we flatter our selves with reducing the scots by force and some very weak debates have passed on both sides upon that head yet to come closer to the matter i must beg pardon to tell my warlike readers that such people may understand for ought i know what belongs to fighting with the french or which they had rather be at with the dutch or which most of all they would be glad of with one another but they seem not at all to understand what it is to fight with the scots  perhaps therefore such will think these following conclusions of mine strange paradoxes and for the present i shall leave them uninterpreted not doubting but knowing men on both sides will reach their meaning and for the rest i shall explain my self hereafter  supposing the present happy temper of both nations toward a union should to all our misfortunes go off and end as to me it seems inevitably necessary in a bloody war between the nations    if the scots should beat you invade northumberland pierce even into yorkshire rout your forces destroy the country and the like they would be     if you invade scotland beat their armies traverse the country and driving the scots to their inaccessibles and retreats make what you call a conquest you are undone    every victory you gain over them in the field you are beaten the scots are conquerors by it and you losers    if you will keep an army upon them to maintain your conquest and keep them in subjection you make them and they shall thank you    at the end of every war they shall have the better of you it shall cost you more to hold them than to gain them and more to lose them again than both  there are more of these paradoxes which in time i may enter upon the explication of and which i doubt not will be made plain to the understandings of all those that can view things with an impartial judgment and free from national prejudices on either side by which it will appear the advantages of this union will be greater to the english than to the scots  but to proceed about this article of peace there is another peace which though equally a blessing i doubt i am not talking to a people equally desirous of and such is our unhappiness that it is the fear of this peace which for ought i know may be the greatest obstruction to some peoples desire of a union and this is an ecclesiastical peace a peace of religion or rather a church peace  i confess i cannot but wonder at the temper of those christians they would be angry if i should not call them such who will have it be that the church of england and the church of scotland are two religions or that the nations profess two religions  such people as first they seem to know little what religion means and that it is indivissible in it self by any other article than the object of religion so they will not understand that nothing can entitle any people to the charge of professing a different religion but the worship of a differing deity  but some people will have breaches seem wider than they really are in order to fright the lovers of union from the attempt of closing  i could heartily wish there were no such thing as a difference in the opinions of christians worshipping the same original author and maker of all things professing the same faith in the same redeemer the same hope and on the same terms with one another but the wisdom of inscrutable providence whose end in it it is neither possible nor needful for us to know has even from the beginning of the christian religion in the world permitted it to be otherwise and who are we that we should pretend to dispute it with him  perhaps these things are suffered in the church of christ for the exercise of the charity forbearance and mutual temper of christians to prevent worse inconveniences which from the pride of prosperity the power and glory of an united church might in conjunction with human infirmity have risen in the world but whether this is a rational conjecture or no it is manifest that these offenses must come and though i will not subjoin the text woe be to him by whom they come i cannot refrain saying woe be to him by whom they are wilfully increased and continued  but to proceed for i desire to abridge the most needful digressions as much as possible as to them that desire to widen our church breaches god in his mercy open their eyes to judge better of things and to be more concerned for the peace of their native country on both sides and there i leave them as a sort of incorrigibles capable of no other conviction than what shall proceed from the irresistible force of an invisible worker of as great miracles as these and lo i turn to the christians for these can hardly merit that name  to you gentlemen of both nations that desire to see the protestant churches of britain flourish that desire to see the union of the body under one united head joined in charity forbearance and love that are zealous sor christian liberty as well as civil liberty and that would rejoice to see differing establishments agree to go hand in hand the direct road to heaven you cannot but covet this union you cannot but foresee it will remove all the secret grudgings repinings and jealousies between two nations of whom never was scripture better adapted to the circumstances of both than that of abraham to lot let no strife be between us for we are brethren genesis       would then those gentlemen who cry out of persecution and severities exercised upon their episcopal brethren in scotland though those things are far lesstrue than have been suggested would they obtain a settled legal tolleration in scotland for episcopal dissenters founded in the charity and tenderness to them on the part of the government and their peaceable obedient and christian behavior and submission to the laws on their part things on which all christian governments do depend this would effect it  establishments and national churches are here sixth on both hands and it is the farther establishing and fortifying those settlements not the exposing them to change or invasion on either hand which is the principle end of all the religious part of a union  as for those people who expect the scots to rescind their settlement restore a church government which they do not approve of and subject national principles to foreign constitution they show indeed their zeal for their own opinion but not their sense of the circumstances of both nations in which unalterable establishments both civil and religious are already consented to by the legislature of each kingdom nor do these people seem to understand what the union we are upon means it is no way the business of a union to alter but to confirm secure and render impregnable the present settlements of both kingdoms that when we come to live as brethren under one administration there may be a noli me tangere placed upon these things and they may be capable of no invasion alteration or dissolution either by the power of the strongest or the concessions of the weakest  the constitutions and establishment of religious matters being thus settled made sacred and inviolable a thoro effectual legal tolleration of orthodox opinions dissenting from the establishments in either kingdom will be an alternative which no christian member on either side will debate being a debt from one kingdom to the other and from both to the weakness and good meaning of their fellow christians as also a due homage paid to the sovereignty of conscience which is and ought to remain free and unimposd upon in all things the general subjection to the being and authority of our maker and acknowledgment of him by religious worship only preserved and supported  shall any man say to me these things are not advantages sufficient to move us on both sides to a sincere concurrence in and pursuit of a national union what shall they have to object when all our religious or rather irreligious feuds shall die and be buried under the immortal column of national establishment and legal tolleration when envy and invasion shall be rendered impracticable and the doors be barred and secured by the locks and bolts of the law against all manner of divisions that can be any way fatal to the general harmony of the whole when the nations shall be united in nothing wherein they ought to differ and differ in nothing wherein they ought to unite when they shall unite in affection where they cannot unite in opinion and never differ in charity though they may differ in judgment  and i cannot but note here one observation of my own as a man that is safely landed on a firm and high rock out of the reach of the insulting waves by which he was in danger of shipwreck surveys the distant dangers with inexpressible satisfaction from both the sense of his own security and the more clear discovery of the reality of the hazards he had run which did not perfectly see before  so it will not only be an inexpressible pleasure to us to look back and see the dangers we shall be delivered from in bot h nations when this happy union shall once be obtained but we shall then with astonishment see plainly such rocks such shelves and such inevitable gulphs of destruction avoided as our keenest understanding will not permit us now to imagine possible  i have heard that when the spanish armada in      was after all our fabulous stories of sir fra drake and his wonders by the mere hand of providence storm and tempest more than our opposition disperssd scattered and by various disasters rendered useless to the design and the expedition overthrown q elizabeth was often heard to say that had they entered the mouth of the thames and been joined by the duke of parma from flanders who lay ready to come over with   000 men of the best troops the world ever saw england must have submitted and she had been undone and her majesty owned she say more of the danger then after they were beaten than she did before  i have not room to prove here that the queens observation was just which any that knows the history of those times that the d of parma who was one of the greatest generals and the spanish troops then the best soldiers of that age and that the queens forces were all raw undisciplined new raised and rather crowds of militia than a real army will readily join in it  but my observation is from the queen s reflecting back on this more particularly after the danger was over and the nation delivered than before  and i firmly believe if ever this happy union of the nations comes to a conclusion those gentlemen that talk very slightly of it now and seem rather willing to keep open the breach than to close it will see things with a different aspect will have their optics extended and see the gulphs and precipices which they blinded by ignorance and prejudices are now willing to push the nations upon not having reach enough to discern the danger  but to go on with our head of advantages from a national union    safety and security and by this head i do not mean barely against one another and the many unhappy consequences of the present precarious circumstances of both nations as they respect future war or peace but i mean also the mighty additions of strength and security against any foreign enemy when the power of both nations is twisted together and interwoven one with another by their mutual interests and in this i must be allowed to say without the least partiality that the advantage is wholly on englands side whose power is by the addition of scotland so fortified that it must be her own fault if she does not make a different figure in all the affairs of europe to what she ever did before  some have the ill nature to object here that this union will enrich scotland which they think no advantage to england but if scotland shall now become a branch of england and we are no more divided into kingdoms and governments but make one united government of great britainr whose shall be the wealth and when shall the consequences of that accession terminate  when i come to discuss the articles of trade i shall make it evident   that indeed scotland shall grow rich and so they may without a union if you will do them justice and they pursue the just advantages nature and providence dictate to them   that their riches shall not be our poverty nor their increase any way interrupt or interfere with ours but rather add to it  suppose then the scots to grow rich by the union what shall be the consequence but this among a thousand others that their lands shall obtain improvements and both these shall end in keeping their numerous hands at home  and whose shall be the advantage of keeping those thousands of people at home which now fill the armies and spread the colonies of all the nations in europe  if the wealth and strength of a nation consists in the multitude of its inhabitants what addition of strength shall it be to this nation when the scots shall be kept at home and tempted by the profits of their labor to stay where they can live easy which they would always do if they could and if so shall for ever after be your assistants and defenders bound by the bonds of their own interest  men never seek their bread by arms nor by traveling into foreign countries generally speaking till some sort of hardships want or other uneasinesses renders them a little desperate and living hardly at home they find themselves under necessity of going abroad to avoid the meannesses and difficulties they meet with in theit own country  improvements of land application to manufactures increase of trade fishing shipping and the like will certainly produce this effect to scotland that it will kerp their people at home of which by it self  and whose shall the advantages of their numbers be to whom shall their duty their power and their increase of all kinds revolve but to the advantage of england  some people have had the vanity to say we are in england a match for the whole world and our naval strength will defend us against all invasion i pray god we may never find occasion to put this to the trial but without doubt were scotland effectually united to england peopled improved and strengthened as it may and ought to be it would in time more than double our strength and perhaps at last we might be an overmatch for any single nation in the world  we do not indeed seek or expect an immediate addition of wealth by a union with the scots though some are very fond of making the scots seem poorer than they are  but additions of strength are very good equivalents and very material to us and as useful to preserve as our trade is to increase our wealth what is it we fight for now in europe not for money not to increase our wealth but to preserve that we have already got if an addition of scotland does not increase our wealth though i do not grant that neither if it does fortify us to keep and defend what we have already it is an article no wise man will despise  scotland is an inexhaustible treasure of men as may be demonstrated by the vast numbers they have in our armies and navy and in the armies of the swede the pole the muscovite the emperor holland and france what might not england now do had she in her pay all the scots actually in the service of these princes where they are daily cutting one another throats and at the expense of their countrys impoverishment gain the empty reputation of being the best soldiers in the world  this is a treasure beyond the indies and what few people know how to value and it has hitherto been our happiness that the scots are thus dispeopled and impoverished for had the scots been as rich as they are populous had they been as well furnished with the sinews as they have been with the humor of war had they as much money as men and as much design upon us as courage and bravery to execute we should long ago have sought this union more eagerness than we fancy they seek it now  it is therefore without doubt our interest to secure these advantages now the particulars of which i shall enter upon when i come to discourse of improvements in trade  there are innumerable advantages which i cannot touch at here on the scots side as the increase of the estates and freehold of the nobility and gentry the increase of their trade and the bringing their country into a perfectly new posture both as to the way and manner of living thriving and growing rich not to talk of their fishing trade which is an india at their own door a treasure sent them from heaven which they cannot be long so weak to let another nation rob them of as hitherto they have done  thus peace both civil and religious safety strength and by consequence the increase both of trade and wealth are the immediate general advantages of this union to both nations    i think there should seem but small occasion after all this to enter upon the necessity of this union to either nation advantages are real necessities and it may very properly be said we cannot be without that which we cannot be without but to our great loss and inconvenience  i have not touched the article of the succession yet nor have i room for it here i am fully of opinion and belive i reflect on neither nation if i say the consequence of the present dispute between the nations must be a firm effectual union or an open declared rupture and i would only tell those gentlemen who too hastily declare for the latter that i could bring a great many reasons to prove that if ever this matter should break out into a war it will be the most bloody implacable and cruel that ever happened between the nations the scots are poor and that may be allowed beyond what we pretend to but there are such circumstances attending scotland and which render her a nation which the other powers of europe will so gladly espouse that we have unforeseen events to encounter with in such a breach and they judge with small discretion that pretend to account for the consequences but i hope this head is needless to enlarge upon  i shall conclude this tract which i design chiefly as an introduction to the work and useful to prepare the minds of the people to entertain the grateful notion of general union with laying down the scheme of my farther design in which if i have leisure to pursue it i shall attempt to examine the terms of union which the nature of things and circumstances of both the nations seem to lead us directly upon  i shall not undertake to examine the imperfect schemes of other men nor assume the vanity of being arrived to a perfection in my own i know there are difficulties in a thing so nice and where prerogatives and privileges both of prince and people seem to clash where emulations in families honors trade and circumstances of state seem immovable and differences and animosities of religion and parties have run high  but a propensity in both sides to union a sense of mutual advantages and a view of the absolute necessity of a union will remove abundance of these difficulties  trifles must not stand in the way of superior peace and things are justly called trifles with respect to nations and the weighty concerns of the blood of ages that are otherwise in themselves considerable  i know some people are very fond of what they call a federal union and abundance of considerations move them to it though i believe the greatest reason most of them can give is because they cannot see through another and think a general entire or incorporate union impracticable or at least that they think both nations will not come up to it  i shall prescribe nothing but endeavor to show how both are feasible and lay open the articles of either as plain as i can  the heads now to be treated of with respect to this union i take to be three religion state and trade and if in all these i can by enquiry find out such mediums as may to the mutual advantages of both nations amount to a settlement i cannot but think we ought not to fall out about the enquy whether those advantages may seem to be more to one nation than another  and should that be the unkind debate the gentlemen that raise it will have this misfortune that in all the three articles mentioned the balance of advantage shall turn on our side and against their pretended exceptions which i make no question to prove even in the article of trade it self in which some people are so very clamorous  finis
