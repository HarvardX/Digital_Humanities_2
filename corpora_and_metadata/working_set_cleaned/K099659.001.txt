analects in verse and prose chiefly dramatical satirical and pastoral  vol i  london printed for p shatwell opposite durhamyard in the strand j dodsley pall mall and t davies russel street covent garden mdcclxx  to charles dunster esquire of oriel college oxford dear sir the indefatigable means you took to convince me of your friendship by promoting the following trifles made me take the liberty of inscribing them to you for indeed i had scarce hinted my intention when you took the earliest opportunity of procuring those essentials which have proved the means of my bringing them to light i am perfectly convinced that you have humanity enough to overlook the too many imperfections you will meet with if you should have patience enough to read my little analects for from my connections in business and the attention that i am from an innate affection obliged to pay my fireside have made me in some measure more inattentive than i should have been i have inserted many i could have wished to erase because i had not time to finish many pieces which i had begun and indeed i was out in my calculation in what would furnish a couple of volumes but yet determined not to extend it in appearance i mean not as is generally done on these occasions to give much paper and little printing i often wished to have found you at my elbow when i have sent a proof to press that you might have given a polish to the many rude and uncultivated passages i am afraid you will stammer at  however i shall trust to your candor and good sense to make such allowances as you shall think necessary and when i see you i am sure you will show so much the gentleman as to whisper my errors to me that no assiduous critic may know there is a fault through you when he has not capacity enough to find it out himself  but this is rather unnecessary as i am so circumstantially convinced of your friendship and esteem for i always perceived on those occasions that you seemed happy rather to throw a veil over an error in your friend than expose it to the greedy ear of envy for the sake of selfostentation or the elevating plaudits of a select society  i was once in hopes that the nutbrown maid would have made its appearance on the the stage but mr garrick gave me so many sufficient reasons why it would not do not altogether divesting it of merit that i resigned my hopes with pleasure knowing from the many material marks of friendship i have experienced from that gentleman if it had been perfectly calculated he would have given it the fairest chance in his power therefore i printed it hoping it might afford some little entertainment in the closet you was pleased some time ago to send me a few corrections you had made in what i had given you to look over but by some accident or other i had the misfortune to lose them which was of no little concern to me as what they were have escaped my remembrance so that at least i am convinced you will meet with the same errors again whence i thought it necessary to give you some reason why i have not adhered to your amendments but if ever a future opportunity should offer on the like occasion i will endeavor to be more careful

better stick to poor sue if she knew you was here she would be breaking her heart i suppose   allan there is no harm man in having two strings to ones bow for when one is too full of her airs i like to have another to fly to   robin and yet you are mightily mift too when sue happens to smile at any body but yourself  huntsmen and horns heard at a distance allan hark the hounds   robin in dad so

stag in the field when fatigued with the chase in the grove we repose and dian her tribute to cupid bestows now to sair emma who knows not who i am but believes me to be a banished man i have played upon her in disguise and in a peasants garb made more advancements in her good esteem than the gayest knight or fopling of the court with all the glaring outside of success who woo but with their clothes  an hollowing heard without but yonder come some gentlemen of the hunt proclaiming by their shouts the pleasures of a wellspent day   scene v enter huntsmen etc joy to ye gentlemen the sport has been successful    st huntsman thanks to you sir    d huntsman i think i never saw so fine a chase there has been much danger too   henry the more the danger greater still the sport i saw a rustic scouring yonder cliff and being eager in pursuit unluckily he tript and tumbled headlong down but fortunately for him he was received by the friendly stream below which broke his fall that otherwise must have broke his neck   both huntsmen ha ha ha poor fellow    st huntsman if he had happened to have been in love such a tumble might have cured him  but come my appetite is keen i linger for refreshment let us toward home    d huntsman your company will be a pleasure to us sir if you are disposed this way   henry sir my disposition is to comply with every kind entreaty the day is on the decline and i am far from home my horse is at a cottage near at hand  this is my way and should have been right glad if chance had made it yours    st huntsman then take good care you meet not with a witch   henry a witch    d huntsman aye but a lovely one with many charms and witches deal in charms you know   song take care good sir how you pass there is danger i assure you should you meet the pretty lass perhaps she may allure you there is witchcraft in each eye no mortal can resist em pouting lips of coral die oh how i could have kissed em  henry i do not understand you enchantment and witchcraft what may you mean    st huntsman why sir i will tell you as we came along the skirts of this wood a lovely damsel wrapped in thought was walking to and fro beneath the shade now and then she would press her hand against her breast then with eyes full of loveliness and tears she would look around sigh as if her gentle heart would break and of a sudden cry oh wretched me   henry of what appearance pray    d huntsman she wore the habit of a shepherdess we entreated the cause of her distress but she rebuked us for our pains with such a modest grace that we retired   henry poor girl a love affair perhaps    st huntsman i fancy so    d huntsman i wish i had been the happy object i would have given my fortune for her love   henry then you might have had it i dare say    st huntsman i imagine if we had persevered a little patience might have brought her to our purpose   henry not if she be really in love reason will argue ineffectually when love is rooted in the heart   song reason to love is urged in vain no force can break his silken chain he reigns without control unseen the god directs his dart but soon we feel the envenomed smart lie rankling in the soul   d huntsman then well think no more of her so good day to you sir i will go and make love to a sirloin and a bowl of punch and i warrant i make em submit  exeunt huntsmen singing one way and henry the other scene vi a

him i shall begin to pity him lest he should feel on my account what i for henry feel aside   allan ah i dont mind that though you dont think so i am sure you pretty lasses like a deal of courting   song you frown and look shy but i know not for why it is only to try if i love should i go away i know you would cry stay ods niggars but i will never move i know very well if you love you wont tell

again   allan o but i will i know you cannot help loving when you are a little better acquainted with me for i have often heard my granny say that two chumps that had been a good many years together in our house fell in love with one another and it was a hard matter to part them   emma that is to say should i be as great a log as thyself i must of course fall in love with thee if there were nobody else in the world   allan hey how is that you puzzle me there too i dont know what to make of that saying i never heard of it before in all my born days will you say it again i will guess at it

nothing but  sings as i trudged out one morning to derrydown dale to eat a hot cake and to drink some good ale i met with a maiden whose cheeks were as red as a sweet damask rose or a strawberry bed i learnt her to sing it though by the bye can you sing it it is a good merry song if you knew it   emma pray thee go sing by thyself i am not disposed for mirth just now take thyself away good fellow and some other time i may listen to thee   allan why that is kind too but where shall i see you another time   emma why here perhaps or hereabout   allan but what will you give me for remembrance

forever   allan plague ons ugly face i say i dont like im he is bewitched the pretty creature already   henry as what i am going to say requires secrecy i must beg this swain to retire a while till i have related my story but if your affections are so strongly rooted that you cannot bear a moments separation i will withdraw and let it die with me   emma no rather talk forever if henry be thy theme if thy story be retarded by this fellows presence would to heaven i had a giants strength that i might spurn him from my sight for like an hateful insect has he teazed me till i sickened with impatience and disgust   robin within hola sue sue here my lass here they are   emma more interruptions perplexing fates   allan hey dey what sue speaks in a fright o the devil take this wizzard i say

have been glad had it been your inclination too to have passed an heavy hour now and then together and been friends that is all   henry you speak sir like a gentleman and are most welcome i assure you and as you have offered me your friendship you shall find me grateful and sincere i am grieved to find a man with such a heart in such a situation but come let us be cheerful   song though care with heavy hands oppress and fortune leaves us to distress yet should the gods once condescend to bless me with a single friend i would not call the fates unkind though thus imprisoned and confined friendship should drive my cares away and make me hope a better day  edwin i have not had so agreeable an interview these twelvemonths   henry these twelvemonths i hope you have not been here so long   edwin much longer sir   henry i am sorry for it your crime surely must be great indeed to incur so long a punishment   edwin i think i may venture to say it is more an accident than a crime   henry prisons were not made for the unfortunate but the wicked and abandoned may i presume to enquire the cause perhaps i may have it in my power to be your friend   edwin alas i am afraid not in such a case my fathers death was all the cause   henry imprisoned for your fathers death shall i entreat your name perhaps i am too bold   edwin my name sir is edwin i was born at philodale   henry at philodale as i live my old schoolfellow and my sisters lover how fortunate aside but i cannot understand sir how your fathers death could be the cause of your imprisonment   edwin when he died he left a person in this neighborhood his executor sightless who you must have seen but though he bears the name of justice he is i am afraid as great a stranger to her rules as he is to pity he ever pretended that my father died involved and as i could not contradict it was forced to think so too this was a sad shock though the least of my affliction for i was betrothed to the lovliest maid whose fortune was almost equal to her beauty but alas becoming destitute and poor could never think of seeing her again and wrote her word i meant to pass the seas never to return   henry o most distressing tale but pray go on   edwin before my father died having an occasion for a certain sum previous to his knowledge which i had scarcely hinted to his worship but he begged he might oblige me i thought it kindness and gladly embraced the opportunity i gave my note with promise of a double interest but ere the best of fathers had closed his eyes and my time for the payment of the debt unfortunately expired he hurried me to prison where i have been a sad and melancholy being ever since i would have wrote to certain friends but he has cruelly deprived me of that advantage by giving the jailor the strictest charge never to place a pen and ink within my reach or let one letter pass the door which action has often made me think he is played me foul   henry no doubt sir o the villain come my worthy friend do not despair i have a charm about me that shall extricate us both if you dare venture to assist i will prove your friend i have a stratagem on foot by which you will find i ll make a fair example of his worship and you shall be revenged and if they refuse us liberty here is a key that will unlock the strongest bolt   edwin then you may command me and depend on my integrity i shall not dread the consequence or danger since if we fail they cannot make us greater prisoners than we are if they take my life twill be a charity   henry if i dont preserve both life and liberty i will resign my own i want to be your friend   edwin and i want liberty propose your plan i long to be in action   song who would not die for liberty what wretch would bear to live a slave and fear the cord the rack or grave i will not bear nor guiltless wear the cruel chains of infamy no no i would sooner die  henry then to the point you have heard no doubt on what suspicion i was committed the superstition of the rusticks has possessed em merely from my appearance that i deal in witchcraft   edwin twas that report that first excited me to visit you   henry when i found they first suspected it i endeavored to make em believe that i really did by threatening them in the most romantic phrases  but i may depend on your integrity you say   edwin you may sir on the forfeit of my life   henry then that you may not be deceived i am not what i seem   edwin indeed i did suspect it   henry no more on that head at present but why i bear this character you shall know hereafter be satisfied you shall not remain a prisoner here another day were i to declare myself they would gladly give me liberty yet as i have a reason for this strange project i will go through it   edwin you transport me with pleasure and astonishment   henry what most concerns me is there was a fair one in my company whom they have imprisoned too without the smallest circumstance of guilt only that she was with me   edwin there was the most lovely maid i ever saw brought this morning to the prison   henry this morning   edwin scarce an hour since   henry that is strange has she not been here all night   edwin i can assure you no sightless and his wife brought her this morning and when his worship left the prison he gave the strictest orders to the jailor that none should see her but himself which made me pity her indeed   henry you amaze me sdeath but this disturbs me could not one speak with the jailor   edwin most certainly i will call him hither if you please   henry sir you will much oblige me if you would   edwin goes off the stage and calls the jailor and reenters immediately henry dont you think he might be prevailed upon to let us see her   edwin i doubt it much such men as him are generally strangers to humanity and seldom will be moved to a good action by any thing but a bribe   henry that he shall have with all my heart   edwin here he comes   scene vii enter jailor jailor swounds master edwin you call with as much authority as his worship what the plague is the matter with you i thought you had been hanging yourself and was calling me to cut you down   edwin that is very probable to be sure   jailor why i would have done it for you to be sure for my own sake   edwin how for your own sake what interest could you have in that   jailor what why your carcass and your clothes the one i should have got a trifle for from the surgeons and the others i would have sold to the ragshop   henry what a savage faith my friend you seem to have a good notion   jailor aye have not i master   henry nobody a better  methinks you and i shall agree very well   jailor i dont know that though   henry i dare say we shall could you let me change a word or two with the young woman you had brought into prison this morning   jailor no  you speak with her hey what should such an old codger as you want with a young woman no no it will not do it will not do   henry will this do shews him money   jailor hey why as you say  i dont know but it may they are pretty looking fellows enough seemingly   henry are they not i thought you and i should agree i am an excellent physician you see i know the strength of your constitution better than yourself you find   jailor why aye you carry a pleasant kind of physic about you few make a wry face at it i fancy   henry dont i well what do you say shall we agree   jailor i dont know what to say to it in faith i am almost afraid   henry pshaw man what should you fear   song pray who can say you are to blame since all your betters do the same my lord makes harvest of his place then prithee where is the great disgrace the crime is sure not worse in you should you pursue the maxim too for greater knaves at any hour will for a bribe restrain their power  jailor faith dad i like your notion you seem to be a good hearty cock give me your hand you will not blow me i hope you understand me   henry no upon my honor   jailor why then it is agreed   henry then take your reward and show us the way come my worthy friend you must bear me company   jailor you dont take him with you i hope meaning edwin   henry yes by all means   jailor nay with all my heart though by the bye take care his worship dont pop in upon you i expect him here anon he seems to have cast a longing eye upon her himself   henry that will be lucky again i shall be there to protect her aside o never fear us well take care of ourselves   without jailor jailor   jailor coming coming here take the key she is in the best room you know the way master edwin and so good luck to you   henry we thank you  exit henry and edwin jailor blame me but this is a good dose egad i should like to take such physic every day  exit jailor scene vii changes to another part of

chase the morn was fair the air serene and cheered each shepherd lad the rustling woods were dressed in green the vales with verdure clad ceres her golden crops had shorn and harvesthome had sung with dians hounds and early horn the hills and valleys rung at such a time on such a day lord eglington arose then sallied he with horse away and to the woodland goes his coat was all of saxon green and velvet was his cap a neater sportsman never was seen to scout the mountain lap a bolder steed a braver sir never followed hunters cry for ever he plied the chafing spur he seemed to ride and fly his dogs well trained no better sure ere couched at command a gun more certain and secure never graced a sportsmans hand over rocks through woods and down the steep like perseus in his pride twould glad the heart to see him sweep adown the mountain side beneath an hill alack the day a lurking poacher stood all eager watching for his prey beside a lonely wood who thought ere long some snipe or hare would rise within his shot he cocked his gun he trimmed his snare but little proved his lot anon a lovely woodcock stired within the watery brake which soon the watchful spaniel heard who to his master spoke the poacher heard the fond alarm and saw the victim rise he poised his piece with skilful arm he shot and hit his prize then instantly rechargd with speed and watched with greedy eye but little thought who next would bleed what nobler game should die unlucky shot unlucky bird to loose thy harmless state unlucky eglington that heard the summons to thy fate o had thou elsewhere been engaged we had not felt this woe had thou in warlike combat waged with some more noble foe some fiend of fate was sure abroad and mischief bore command thy stars combind in one accord and death stood dart in hand my lord pursued the fatal sound with anger in his mind and in the vale the poacher found upon his gun reclined when thus he gan the man to chide that durst invade the law who strove his gun and game to hide and blushed with guilt and awe resign presumptious hind resign thou have no business here these lands and woods thou know are mine resign or thou wilt pay dear i will not resign thou haughty lord although these lands are thine i have said it and i will keep my word the gun shall still be mine the hand that gave each creature breath and planted every tree will shield me from the hand of death as soon as it will thee impartial nature never designed that lords alone should reign to tax the air to rule the wind the tyrants of the plain i feel an appetite and will a thirst for pleasure too and have as great a right to kill and eat as well as you now boiled the blood within the veins of brave lord eglington rage unbridld all her reins whilst vengence spurred him on with blood all blurted in his face and lightning in his eyes i will not endure this language base from one like thee he cries harsh was the language which he spoke like hercules he frowned and with a stout and pithy oak he struck him to the ground as one felled by a thunder stroke he speechless lay awhile then half recovered thus he spoke in melancholy style inhuman lord you little know the means that brought me here you might have spared each cruel blow and yielded me a tear is it because that chance has thrown thee into fortunes arms to call these woods and vales thy own which yield a thousand charms is it for this that thou should be so cruel and unkind a stranger to humanity where poverty you find it is because thou art in need of what my gun has slain if that should be the case indeed i never would shoot again or if like me thou should depend on what the fields afford who save my gun can boast no friend to furnish out my board for know proud lord i should not care to venture forth for game were i not hunted by despair to risk my life and name go to yon cot and there survey a scene would melt a stone where often i sigh the livelong day in melancholy moan where the sad mother weeping stands surrounded by a brood that lift their little harmless hands and cry aloud for food where through the low and shattered wall keen blows the whistling wind when snows in fleecy showers fall and winter bites unkind when trees that late with leaves were hung small icicles adorn and where the cheerful thrushes sung the stockdoves sit forlorn there boldend by my wretched state through these fair lands i roam and when good luck shall prove my fate i bring my treasures home with joy i see my infants feed and bless the lucky day i feel no sorrow at the deed while round my hearth they play audacious clown replied my lord that dares thus to my face thy lawless practices record and boast an act so base but these instructions i will not bear and therefore clown resign thou shall nor woodcock shoot nor hare while these fair lands are mine throw down your arms and go your gate and follow good advice you will repent it man too late if here you venture twice i will go my gate the poacher cried and here offend no more the world thank heavens fair and wide twas made for rich and poor it is gien the bold and pampered steed to brouze in pastures gay on rich and luscious food to feed and wanton all the day whilst natures slave the humble ass dejected meek and poor is glad a leisure day to pass upon the barren moor released his burden there he feeds and thinks the thistle sweet he asks no more than nature needs a belly fulls a treat he thirsts not for the gold he bears when weary on the road but ever happy he appears if moderate his load so i emburdend with distress denied these vales to tread i will forth to yonder wilderness and seek my daily bread the forest broad the dreary wilds though poor may yet be kind there fortune yield me but thy smiles then blow the roughest wind i ask not for her gold nor wealth be those for lazy pride give me but raiment food and health the rest let fools divide there spite of thee thou haughty peer i will drink tranquillity nor shall i live again in fear of such a thing as thee cease cease thou presumptious slave nor think i will list to thee thou empty moralizing knave how dare thou preach to me resign thy gun thou loon i say or by my soul i swear i will make thee fellow rue the day that ever thou came here then aiming at the poachers head who laughed at what he spoke as if he meant to strike him dead even at a single stroke the poacher to evade the blow three paces back retired his face with passion gan to glow as if his heart were fired i swear then by my breath and blood my gun and i will not part to prove that it is contents are good here take em to thy heart this done down upon the ground he fell like to a wounded deer and sighing wished a long farewell to his corina dear now all aghast the poacher stood to see his deed so foul convulsed boiled his guilty blood and horror seized his soul as one distact and wild was he all stiffend with surprise then falling on his bended knee aloud to heaven cries have mercy mercy gracious god withold the hand of death o spare o spare thy dreadful rod o spare o spare his breath where shall i go where shall i hide how scape thy wondrous eyes how drive the spector from my side when conscience  murder cries accursed be this vile machine accursed the luckless hour o had i in the desert been where savages devour or near the threatening billows swell had i been doomed to stand where thy prophetic mermaids yell along the dreadful strand o had some skylark raised in air or had it proved my lot that snipe or partridge quail or hare had fallen beneath my shot for ah i little thought to find such noble game as thee or that the fates had ever designed this bloody task for me dear hasty youth could i restore that life i have taken away i would my better stars implore and pine from day to day o let me raise thy drooping head and lift thee from the ground and leave o leave this goary bed whilst angels heal the wound with deathly cheek and fainting eye the bleeding earl replied o bear me poacher ere i die to my corinas side there let me take my last farewell once more behold her charms that fame to future times may tell i died within her arms do this be all thy sins forgiven although by thee i bleed do this and may alljudging heaven oerlook thy bloody deed the tears fast down the poachers cheek in streaming showers fell he beat his breast he strove to speak and strove to say farewell grief choked all uttrance for a while but now to words gave way when in a souldestracted style he gan with tears to pray great god of mercy yet restore this sad this bleeding lord for o his goodness wounds me more then could his keenest sword o spare my shame my grief despair o spare his precious life in pity to that tender fair his wished his promised wife ah me she comes my hateful deed is blown through all the world i soon shall be too sure i read to dark perdition hurled my glass is run time tolls my knell my wretched reign is over  my wife my little babes farewell i never shall see you more accursed am i of all mankind to leave ye thus undone ah where will you a father find when i am dead and gone with eyes distract disheveled hair the sad corina came her cries and shriekings pierced the air with calling on his name the names of death and eglington she joined in accents sad  in pity mighty god look down  o let me not be mad will thou eclipse him from my sight by deaths relentless hand my blessed sun that shon so bright the wonder of the land he saw her pangs her voice he heard he pressed her to his side death in his face all pale appeared he blessed her sighed and died the birds nest a fable four giddy boys played truant once who never blushed at name of dunce but rather choose to live as fools than bear confinement in the schools as near a wood they chanced to stray they found a birdsnest in their way all eager scrambling for the nest but one much taller than the rest secured the prize each claimed a share the tallest did not hold it fair and with an aggravating frown he vowed he would keep it all his own the rest with rage were fit to burst when each declared he saw it first and rather than give up their right they gan to quarrel next to fight the nest was on a haycock put till they decided the dispute a clown just by emerging lay to see em once begin the fray he knew he should for he was wise while they were fighting steal the prize no sooner had the fray began but with the nest away he ran the scuffle over to his cost the hero found his prize was lost each gan to simper at his brother to find that after all their pother the potent point so soon decided and every share so well divided the petticoat a new song to the tune of chevey chase twas sometime worthy sirs in may no matter in what year when boys and girls together play and drink in merry cheer it happened once a waggish set bethought em of a joke and near a mighty mansion met the lord on it to provoke high in the air a trophy bore in faith a strange conceit and crowding round his lordships door they hallowed bread and meat a magistrate in truth was he of noble blood derived no mortal had a heart more free his equal never survived the uproar drew his lordship out to know what it could mean but on his chaps received a clout that sent him in again but turning round he cast his eyes and viewed the shameful scene revenge revenge revenge he cries was ere the like on it seen a pettycoat and breeches hung both dangling on a pole the street with claps and hissing rung enough to charm ones soul the meaning soon his lordship knew and straight he raised a band who joining him like heros flew and seized it sword in hand did ever knight in days in yore atchieve such envied fame did ever mortal man before deserve so great a name the k  god bless his royal heart of his own wise accord straight acted he the k  y part and gave him due reward now high in council seat he is placed to rule over rich and poor was ever k  before so graced by any man before now be it known to great and small the wonders he has done and to his fame let bunters ball as through the streets they run the peasant and the ant a fable the fields were ripened all around and ceres head with corn was crowned pomona with her fruits arrayed and plenty coy much envied maid her horn of bounty careless held and dropped a gift in every field a peasant walking through the grain was heard to murmur and complain his face was wan and meagre grown and hunger stamped him with a frown a laden ant was passing by and with her small insectic eye she looked upon the abject man and with revilings thus began art not ashamed ungrateful clown amongst such crops thy wants to own whilst smiling plenty round thee stands inviting thy unwilling hands thou poor incorrigible knave thy sloth will bring thee to the grave benevolence is thrown away on such as thou art every day how can thou ever think to thrive except with industry thou wilt strive to help thyself when there is given before thine eyes such stores from heaven had i one opportunity like this i would lay such plenty by in such a season i would provide enough for all my days beside but i am obliged each day to roam many a furlong from my home and cry good luck whener i pick from off the ground a single stick or in some long or rutty lane i find by chance a single grain had i the art and strength like you to reap to thresh to bake and brew i would not murmur nor complain at winters snow or summers rain which heaven in each season sends to answer all its wiser ends thou boasting thing the clown replied thou little crawling piece of pride or stop thy foul reproaching breath this moment else shall be thy denth for all thy counsels mere pretense to show thy mighty share of sense thy industry and insolence thou would not in this manner prate were thou like me of human state were what i have reaped and what i have sown like what thou gatherst all my own my barns should every one be stored and i as well as thou would hoard  i own the seasons plenty send were men like ants each others friend i would not now come murmuring here were food and raiment not so dear those times thou sure must own are bad when there is no victuals to be had when nature sends her stores at large and earth does all her gifts discharge it is not by god but man denied who feasts in luxury and pride for see yon infant starving dies with all this bounty before his eyes the apology there is no reason to comment the moral is most evident the pretty maid of chelmsford a pretty maid both kind and fair dwells in chelmsford town her pleasing smiles her easy air engages fop and clown being accosted the other day by a clumsy squire who asked her if she knew the way to quench a raging fire water sir replied the maid will quench it in a trice o no said he you little jade i have tried that once or twice then sir said she it is past my skill to tell you what will do i am sure said he you know what will there is nothing can but you alasaday what do you mean replied the pretty fair i would have you try it once again you never should despair despair i cannot cried the squire while you are in my sight it is you must quench the burning fire you set it first alight then strait he clasped her round the waist and forced from her a kiss ho ho said she is that your taste then pray you sir take this and with a pail placed at the door she sluicd the amorous squire youre welcome sir to this and more to quench your raging fire an evenings walk one summers eve when every swain was housed when sol had scarce one glimmer left behind each little star faint glittering cast a ray and spangled over the dusky robe of night fond of the scene i wandered far from home over level lawns and flowerbreeding vales till weary nature slackened in my steps and made me halt upon a friendly bank calm through a bridge there ran a peerless stream that scarcely moved the oziers slender wand here i took my stand and viewed the solemn scene the bat had been an hour on the wing chasing the nightfly and the buzzing gnat the purblind owl had left the ancient tower prowling with flossy wing along the mead anon as out of chaos shot a ray of chearing light quivering over the hills as yet too weak to struggle with the dark or as the egyptian queen far off beheld shot her first beams on the italian shore her brilliant train reflecting on the waves making the tybur like a golden sea clouds that oerhung the horizon unseen appeared in view like silverskirted troops waiting the uprise of the queen of night slow she approached and smiled upon the world opening fresh landscapes to my wondering eyes philomel now cheered the embowring grove the woodlark too mistaking it for day joined her sweet notes with emulating strains near to my left there stood an ancient pile by wasting time and savage war defaced like a reduced and hoaryheaded chief commanding awe even in destruction on its flinty fides deepdyd ivy clung its roof was capt with velvetgrounded moss and round its base wild weeds and flowers grew the stinging nettle with the briars blend the secret haunt of adders and of toads through the wide breaches of the rockbuilt walls pale cynthia beamed her lucid columns down upon the verdant slope in lines direct and clear reflecting on a dimpled brook below a solemn silence now overspread the globe save when the minew wantoned on the stream and left a circle spreading to the brink anon as wind from out some hollow cave a deepfelt sigh from out the ruins came as from a heart just bursting with its load which straight was answered with a voice of woe like sorrow soothing the more sad despair awhile i stood in doubt to know the cause or to retreat least some deluding fiend feigning the voice of grief meant to destroy at length resolved with caution i approached o melting sight my wounded heart ran over and emptied at my eyes  a mournful pair the woeful partners of affliction sat on the low basis of a mouldering urn and opened to my view a tragic scene concealed i stood observing their distress she in her lap an infant cherub held a lovely boy the offspring of their loves her eyes were bent with sorrow on the babe while in her face the little dear one smiled and then with tears of misery and love she clung him eager to her throbbing breast the wretched husband on her neck reclined striving to cheer his melancholy dame feigned a hope though foreign to his heart but when he found despair had seized her soul his tears burst forth and bathed his manly cheeks and on his bended knees he trembling fell lifting his eyes with anguish against the sky with invocations loud and agonizing sighs imploring heaven for a ray of peace till his loud accents shook the vaulted roof and rift his tortured breast  i could no more but flying to his aid with heart distressed he fixed his eyes with furious glare upon me and threatened me with death if i advanced like the fierce tiger assailed by hunters in his dreary den he stood defensive over his young shielding em from danger with humble voice and friendly tears i moved him to attend and listen patient to the voice of pity joy then with fear and admiration mixed overspread each face and as i spoke they blessed hope like the sun that clouds had long oerveild flushed on their cheeks extinguishing despair ye woeful pair let your suspicions cease if friends forsake and creditors pursue if you once more can trust a thought to hope and think it possible to meet a friend tell me your story and you yet shall find that fate relents and ceases to afflict though here to you a stranger i appear to mercy i am none to see another wretched makes me wretched too by serving others i still myself oblige and meet reward ample reward a tranquil happiness seeing others so by me made happy i would rather wipe the tear of grief away than add a ruby to a monarchs crown and win a princes promise for my pains if fates not given you over to despair and you will accept of friendship once again cheer your sad hearts  let every fear subside nor doubt a stranger yet may prove a friend if you would be happy tell me but in what i will try my every means to make ye so thou gracious being if thou art human for thou speak with a celestial tongue let me embrace thee  o pardon me too that i assailed thee with the threat of death when thou but meant to save me from his shaft for o thy words were welcome to my soul as mollient dews that fall upon the mead when parching sol has curled each verdant blade thou have preserved to me the dearest rose that ever scented gale the sweetest bud that ever eye beheld or tempted death to kill this drooping fair one and her smiling boy for they have suffered more than i dare tell and to repeat is more than i can bear she once alas was fortunes favorite and minervas pride the tender fondling of a wealthy pair  o sad remembrance provoking tears when will ye cease to flow these eyes have long been strangers to a smile excuse me friend if they disgust thee we sing of others woe but cry our own my heart has gushed at a thousand veins to see the sufferings of a matchless wife  there was a time when this forsaken hold at such an hour would have given delight when solitude and night would give a scop to thought and yield a pleasing melancholy to the jaded mind oerchargd with pleasure and variety but now how dreary and forlorn it seems and as we tell our mournful tale with double horror echoes back each word mocking adversity in hollow sounds  telling us over what is death to hear  such tales as mine good friend i often have read such woeful scenes have often been played with sympathizing heart i have heard and seen and dropped a tear for the oppressed and brave but ere i would slept the fiction fled my breast and time would leave no traces on the mind when we become the objects of distress remembrance stamps it with an iron seal upon our hearts and every thought is death but to my story it is my friends desire  i am no stranger to this gloomy pile i often have paid a visit to these walls and often admired the romantic form when the fair morn invited me abroad when fertile nature dasyd every hill and every meadow blushed a purple hue when thrushes sang and linnets charmed the grove my heart then drank in pleasure at my eyes and felt no interrupter by the way no wretched thought to dash it back again  my father was a man of wealth and note and held a mansion in a village by a better never gave being to a son  i having read of mighty things abroad of ancient rome and grand cairos court the wealth of india and egyptian wilds with thirst for novelty and desire i urged my father and at length prevailed that he would let me venture on a tour and prove the truth of history and report  it is six years since i left my native home since when so many wonders i have seen that curiosity at last grew sick returning home i crossed the mighty alps a deadly sickness seized me on the way and made me seek for succor and a friend a greater rarity than all i would met an ample dwelling opened to my view to which i bent my way and shelter asked and was received at once a welcome guest with mild compassion they beheld my state and strove to cheer me with a friendly voice dismounting here i would have entered in but that my feet their wonted use denied my limbs gave way and let me to the ground when this dear fair came running to my aid she raised me up and led me careful in and every day a true attendance paid when i was struggling with the pangs of death and with consoling hope she would drop a tear imploring heaven to preserve my life her supplications did at length prevail no sooner had i conquered one compeer but found my heart was with another taken love to whom i soon submitted and embraced and made my hostess partner of my life but here partaker in affliction too  her father was a briton once of wealth and held a mansion in that happy isle till revolution and domestic broils destroyed his lands and plundered all he had save a few stores in fecret he had saved putting himself and family to flight to seek for refuge in a foreign land  the action robbed the good man of his life and in distress the mournful widow left with this fair comforter to buffet life and shield her from a base ensnaring world here eighteen months i lived in social joy and in the desert found the dearest wife the kindest mother ever man could boast her better spirits so outworn by grief that made her frame like frozen lillies fade recline and droop unto the earth again not having heard one tiding from my friends for many a day then we for england made and ere we reached the shore the wind blew high and frowning neptune on the surface foamed throwing up watery mountains in our way and in his anger dashed us on a rock some twenty perished in the yawning deep but we escaped to meet a harder fate we saved our lives but saw our cargo sink no sooner had i stepped with pleasure on the shore but met the tidings of my fathers death from one misfortune often comes a crowd for some malignant enemy of mine informed the good old man i would long been dead and ere he died he chose another heir and left him all his fortune and estate here each glaring circumstance arose and filled me with surprise i asked his name landore he cried a wealthy neighbor here landore ye mighty gods how just i am that heir thy worthy father chose and for his friendship and his love to me i will give his son his fortune back again i had enough before to make me happy and but resign that superflux to him which fate had chosen me steward to a while to quit my claim upon a just demand epigram on lord g  my lord has often said he scorns the wretch whod fain conceal his horns and from his heart quite full of glee he wished all cuckolds in the sea a merry wag pleased with the whim replied my lord pray can you swim end of vol i
