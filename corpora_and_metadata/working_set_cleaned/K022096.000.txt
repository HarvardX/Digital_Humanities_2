summers sunny morn while yet the dew drop glittered on the thorn i have sought the cliff or in the flowery vale imbibed the fragrance of the evening gale fair fugitive whose eye of heavenly blue and rosy cheek no longer bless my view whose loved idea which can never fly wakes the fond wish and heaves the fruitless sigh thy sweet remembrance now the song inspire and touch the lover with a poets fire what brighter genius what distinguished name shall lend its luster to the pleasing theme lives there a man that with superior art sounds all the deep recesses of the heart calls up the genial hopes the chilling fears now shakes with laughter now dissolves to tears who proteus like at pleasure shifts the scene or old or young impassioned or serene still faithful to his aim if such there be blessed child of nature garrick thou art he come then a while forego the thronged applause which nevererring judgment justly draws and with the light the gay descriptive muse while pleased her airy travel she pursues recall the happy scene which once was ours the smiles the graces and the jocund hours with whom we frolicked in our early day when pleasure filled her cup without allay from every quarter of earths peopled sphere see at the muses call what crowds appear eager alike to run lifes little span the gay the reckless progeny of man ah happy race far happier than they know light as the summer breeze first bid to blow unceasing as the busy tribes on wing that roam the blossoms and despoil the spring along the verge of that fair seeming hill where life ascends and hebe sports at will they move nor mark upon the neighboring heights what envious eyes oerlook their young delights suspicion rumor with uncertain stare and farther up the fiend sharp visaged care blessed ignorance to partial views confined where sight would injure who would not be blind young is the sense enjoyment in it is spring hope yet unbroken fancy on the wing the jest the easy laugh the wanton wile and antic trick which mocks with harmless guile these are the sweets their youthful morn bestows the bloomy flush of health and sound repose thrice happy whom no greater cares employ than for to morrows sure returning joy yet have they ills for man to ills is heir and youth as well as age has got it is share the interdicted wish the harsh command the terrors of corrections rigid hand mishaps the chance of light unthinking years pale surfeit that often wakes a mothers fears discord beside inflames with little rage for discord has her part on every stage but here she walks not in her tragic form as easy raised as easy laid the storm oh how unlike the wasteful ire that rends the laboring breast when riper age contends turn ye ambitious at whose unblest call war wakes his terrors and whole nations fall ye whom the curse of civil rage impels when parricide not war the tumult swells as over britannias much afflicted land the fiend has often waved her horrid brand turn turn nor in this youthful school despise to catch the virtues of the simply wise here no ambition mocks it is fruitless toils no hero weeps repentant over his spoils nor frowning shade of warrior lost in fight breaks the soft slumbers of the peaceful night light as the clouds that drop the vernal showers to open the buds and cheer the rising flowers their quarrels pass and smiling peace returns and a new friendship in each bosom burns too much of discord glad the wandering muse the peaceful and more pleasing toil renews to mark yon tribe where over the mossy ground they fly pursue and leap or run or bound as buoyant spirits prompt them all intent as swallows whom chill winter long has pent now issuing forth upon the warmer beam wave the smooth pool or skim the murmuring stream now here now there their airy sports they ply and many a playful circle cleaves the sky still as the eye wide wanders over the green new aims new objects crowd the changeful scene here rise the mimick works of war like hands there in mock fight engage the marshaled bands here too the painted galley meets the view along the shores exult the admiring crew while over the lake it spreads it is silken sails and all it is streamers feel the rising gales nor frown ye wise if wisdom deign to hear because such artless trifles meet the ear the rose so loved must bud before it bloom and yonder oak that spreads so wide a gloom beneath whose arms the flocks and herds repose his fullgrown honors to an acorn owes in this fair field are sown the seeds of fame in each young bosom lives it is native flame which through these trifles breaks with early ray these but the dawnings of their brighter day in peaceful councils this shall gain renown for that bellona wreaths the war like crown he too who gave his galley to the breeze one day may hold the empire of the seas and now even now elate with fancied power enjoys the glories of the future hour thus roll the months and years a golden round with peace their nights their days with pleasure crowned nature mean time industrious to fulfill the dictates of her mighty masters will the wellbeloved task incessant plies and sees the work in fair proportion rise acts with new vigor on the conscious soul each part enlarges and informs the whole as when the stream first issues from it is source a gentle brook it murmurs without force plays through the pebbles and with silver maze by many a flower and bending willow strays till with fresh tributary stores supplied it pours into the main a copious tide thus swells the stream of life while evermore impatient youth regards the wider shore where mans adventurous bark with sails unfurled first tries the deep and launches on the world passed is the dawn the boyish hours are fled and lo the stripling rears his radiant head with front erect and brightly beaming eye fresh as the star which gilds the evening sky as the young plant the favorite of some fair her early solace and her later care uprising soft with living verdure crowned puts forth it is blooms and spreads it is fragrance round flushed with the gift of health sweet rosy hue thus breaks the riper stripling on the view in all the pride of youth he stands displayed nor dreams that beauty blossoms but to fade blessed season brightest in lifes varied year too soon alas thy verdures disappear too soon thy roses wither in the wind and leave the sharp unsightly thorn behind mean time from violet beds and wreathed bowers advance the graces and the smiling hours with yonder son of hope to sport and play and crown the revels of his flowery may no more of artless words which on the tongue with untaught lisp ever while imperfect hung proud of his opening reason nor less vain of stature that oertops the younger train he glances on them with averted eye admires himself and walks superior by now glows the bosom with more potent fires teems with new projects throbs with new desires robuster sports the stripling youth employ and all his soul is up for manly joy now to the wellreplenished fields he hies sometimes the plain sometimes the woodland tries where haunts the partridge or the timorous hare and where the lapwing beats the sounding air over hill over dale by lake or river toils and late returns exulting in his spoils the cheerful glass the lengthened tale succeeds and all the game again in fancy bleeds sweet are the slumbers that from toils arise more sweet the bliss which innocence supplies light from his couch and well refreshed he springs what time the lark the lively summons sings new joys invite him forth the dewy morn the hound wide opening to the hightoned horn the stag unharboured and the madding throng with furious emulation borne along over the swift steed actaeon like he bends and with the masters of the chase contends thus speeds the morn now sits the sun on high and a fierce luster breaks through all the sky parched are the flowers and blossoms all around the panting flocks lie scattered over the ground and from the reach of phoebus sultry fires imbowered the visionary muse retires not thus the glowing youth he on the shore where breezy waters spread their grateful store forthwith disrobes and in the midway flood allays the tumult of his boiling blood too daring thou thus fond the deep to brave be taught the dangers of the insidious wave it chills relaxes deadly cramps assail ah what shall then thy boasted art avail when with exhausted limbs thou strivest in vain to reach the shores thou never shall regain such was ambrosios such endymions doom oh early lost in youths ethereal bloom twin brothers they the only loved remains of many sons that paid a mothers pains illfated dame to early sorrows bred the wretched mourner of a widowed bed whose lord the chance of battle snatched away ever yet the double offspring saw the day but now the blooming pair her hopes renew in these she seems again her lord to view their filial piety their rising years sooth all her losses and assuage her tears twas on a day the feverish heat to cool they sought the windings of the well known pool along whose margin flowers were thickly spread and many a poplar reared it is graceful head like two fair swans elate in youthful pride they breast the waves and roll the deep aside they sport they toss now vanish now appear fate overlooks them with malignant leer ambrosio now the safer shore had gained endymion still within the flood remained full often the former chid his long delay in vain death challenges the destined prey chill torture now had seized on all his frame ambrosio saw he heard the fearful scream what doubts what thrilling woes the youth surprise what boding horrors in his bosom rise swift to relieve into the deep he drove oh sad requital of fraternal love exhausted faint endymion round him clings and marrs the generous aid his friendship brings vain are all efforts in the embrace he holds fate ratifies the indissoluble folds nor can or youth find grace or beauty save the tender victims from a watery grave at once they sink and once again they rise the deep at length ingulfs the precious prize hail hapless pair ye names for ever dear whose sad remembrance draws the painful tear loved youths companions of my brighter days these mournful rites the song of friendship pays so may the song survive when i decay nor die like you the blossom of a day but see the sun declines a fresher breeze breathes on the flowers and rustles through the trees far in the vale where calm retirement dwells mid solitary rocks and mossgrown cells oerhung with shade that breaks the evening beam now plies the youthful angler on the stream marks the crisped waters with attentive eye and cautious flings the well dissembled fly meantime his toils are soothed with various sounds the mingled music of the rural grounds the thrushs mellow note the larks more shrill the woodmans echo from the neighboring hill while often the cuckoo from the steepy wood cheers the soft murmurs of the nether flood thrice happy youth to whom is given such joy thrice happy whom such guiltless sports employ such were the dear delights that once were mine and such the scenes loved erne which still are thine fairest of floods with whom my youthful day smooth like thyself stole unperceived away blessed days when near thy ample wave i ranged to all the busy cares of life estranged when up the breezy hill each morn i flew and airy youth gave rapture to the view the sunny mead the loveinviting bower the rushclad hamlet and the ruined tower thy numerous isles with waving verdure crowned and azure hills the landscapes distant bound but turn we now where other prospects rise proud structured domes that shade the lessening skies the citys splendor and the motley throng by business or by pleasure urged along the scene we vary not the purposed aim for nature in all places is the same the rustic and the citizen we see in manners differ but in soul agree they love they hate to wrath alike give way and hopes and fears by turns their bosoms sway alike the passions live in every mind and spread their empire over human kind but here within the citys ample round where opulence and men and arts abound all shoots more forward nature earlier blooms and sooner youth the port of man assumes superior in each polished art appears and thinks and talks and acts beyond his years here then amid this fruitful scene of things the pride of riches and the pomp of kings let us mark his motions as the soul expands and on the verge of manhood nature stands till now unnoted or but dimly seen while the first spring revealed it is fainter green come forth the passions nor come forth in vain an ever wakeful and imperious train swift agents full of heavens ethereal fires whose magic touch to instant act inspires a giant host they approach with fearless van mount up and take the little fort of man pride envy hatred wrath with fiery glare and fell revenge that knows not how to spare a numerous throng which follow without names toss their fierce brands and spread the works in flames thus when the darts of sultry sirius fly and sudden horrors often involve the sky from the dark riven cloud the thunder rolls and frequent flashes wrap the blazing poles at once the loosened winds impetuous sweep roar through the forest and upheave the deep weak to resist the reeling bark gives way rolls with the billows and admits their sway such the mixed tumult now that inly swells and such the force of passions which impels but this outrageous phalanx to control their heat to temper and to sooth the soul in sweeter notes love sounds his soft alarms and beauty stands revealed in all her charms awed by her look their terrors they resign compose their rage and own the form divine what hopes what fears what mixed emotions rise what pleasing anguish now the bosom tries blessed raptures never to be twice enjoyed when all is novel and the sense uncloyed ever blooming youth unconscious of alloy has proved the fallacy of human joy with love and earlier often than love desire wakes in the soul a loose ungoverned fire that quick through all the vital frame obtains flames in the heart and revels in the veins dethrones fair wisdom and assaults the shrine where dwell the virtues and the graces shine soft is the voice persuasive are the smiles with which the mercenary fair beguiles how bright the dome that wooes the passing eye how sweet the odours which around it fly airs too eolian airs salute the ear and happiness and heaven itself seems near  turn generous youth nor let the lovetuned lay of thais lure thy heedless steps astray fly fly the sorceress fly her tainted charms remorse disease and death are in her arms but other powers should wily thais fail more fatal often the youthful sense assail gay blooming fresh with never fading green here bacchus opes the jocund nightly scene through the glad circle breaths his social fires cheers with false hopes and fills with vain desires quick flies the jest with laughter loud repayed and many a chorus echoes through the shade till flushed and pregnant with the purple god as when of old the potent mystic rod waved high in air with frenzy fired the throng and the loud io swelled the barbarous song at once they rouse at once their shouts ascend and war and tumult over the town impend unhappy wanderer doomed to certain woes whose steps these sons of belial now oppose thrice hapless he the youth whose fairer fame such wild excesses soil with early shame in some lewd quarrel happily not his own this fatal night his force is overthrown struck with base fears his false associates fly and leave him in the inglorious cause to die ah what avail him now the joys of wine his social merits and his form divine sealed are those lips for ever mute that tongue on which this morn such sweet persuasion hung the smiles the graces every charm is fled and mortal paleness settles in their stead in vain for him the fond expectant sire counts the slow clock and cheers the slumbering fire in vain the anxious matron mounts on high look forth and often heaves the boding sigh far from her aid a bleeding corse he lies and never more shall bless a parents eyes thus here while various ills from bacchus flow mark well the close approach of yonder foe dark son of stratagem who lives by spoils works in the shade and nightly spreads his toils detested monster whom no tears can bend at war with all to all a seeming friend who quotes the maxims of the truly wise and feigns to damn the very art he plies who hugs him in the spoil his frauds have won and turns to laughter those he has undone see how to yonder youth he winds his way calls up his wiles and meditates the prey short is the strife with such unequal foes at every game a wealthy manor goes flocks herds and fields are lost beyond recall and one finesse deprives the youth of all what shall he do an hopeless wretch he stands no longer now the lord of many lands unhoused unpitied forced to beg for bread perhaps from those his former fortunes fed or in the caverns of a jail to lie there mourn his folly and by famine die these are the changes nature now unfolds and thus her favorite son his progress holds here range the virtues there the vices stand he weighs their worth but with unequal hand warped in his choice the balance he suspends and spite of odds the vicious scale descends now vanity her playful part assumes and tricks him out in all her gayest plumes south east and west are sought with curious care and boreas wafts the fluttering youth a share for him the inventive artist hourly plies views every flower and blends the varied dies he raves of fashions gives the important rule which guides the mode of every mimick fool smiles simpers tosses his fantastic head and strikes in thought each hapless fair one dead turn to the insect youth that art so vain then if thou can thy folly still maintain dressed by the summer sun from earth he springs opes his gay downs and spreads his golddropd wings turns every beauty to the sunny ray and winnows with soft wing his easy way till from the north a sudden blast arise down drops the painted flutterer and dies even such the frail condition such the span which circumscribes the little race of man offspring of earth that blooms but to decay the gaudy glittering insect of a day behold him now adrift without a guide borne down where pleasure rolls her rapid tide erroneous flood that wide it is wave expands and in it is progress views a thousand lands a thousand springs their copious urns supply swell the rich stream and pour temptation by what stir what bustle what a mighty throng press to the shores or urge the deep along nor youth alone all ages all degrees female and male the eye of fancy sees for who from pleasure yet ever turned the eye despised the fair and passed her beauties by deluding sorceress stored with every art to warp the judgment and ensnare the heart by thee seduced the warrior doffs his arms and sells his laurels for thy softer charms the merchant too caught by thy wily train foregoes the rich the golden hour of gain thee the fond youth his brighter genius styles hangs on thy looks and lives but in thy smiles blessed youth indeed if in her smiles sincere his mistress were as constant as she is fair ah much misjudging to the future blind who thinks that pleasure always will be kind then when she sooths when most her charms delight even then she meditates dishonest flight bids her false breast with wellfeigned raptures heave and plays the fond one only to deceive finis
