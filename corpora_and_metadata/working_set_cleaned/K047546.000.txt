a word to the wise a comedy as it was performed at the theater royal in drury lane  written by hugh kelly of the middle temple author of false delicacy  london printed for the author and sold by dodsley in pall mall j and e dilly in the poultry g kearsly in ludgate street and t cadell in the strand  mdcclxx  an address to the public the comedy here offered to the world having been banished from the theater through the rage of political prejudice and the author having through that prejudice been no less attacked in his reputation than wounded in his fortune it becomes necessary for him to justify his character as a man however poor his abilities may be as a writer  popular resentment has had it is victim and the sacrifice being now over perhaps a few words may be heard in his defense  for a considerable time previous to the exhibition of the following scenes two charges were industriously propagated against the author and to these charges the unexampled severity exercised on his play may be wholly attributed the first was that mr kelly prostituted the public ledger a daily paper then under his direction to the purposes of administration in consequence of an annual pension he received and instead of conducting it upon principles of impartiality would admit no letters whatever unless professedly written in favor of government  this accusation though constantly rendered absurd by his readiness to insert every proper letter on each side of every public subject gained no little credit but gained it entirely among those who would not be at the trouble of examining into the truth  at length the calumny grew serious enough to demand some notice and accordingly on the   th of february      the following reply was published in the ledger to a fresh attack by an anonymous correspondent upon the independency of that paper  we can assure this gentleman meaning the correspondent that we have never suppressed any thing in favor of mr wilkess cause which was in the least proper for publication but declare on the contrary that we always have been and always shall be as ready to insert the productions of his friends as the letters of his enemies  many pieces on both sides have reached us which we were under a necessity of rejecting because they were too dangerous or too absurd for admittance yet we can with great truth aver that we strictly keep to our title and maintain the most dispassionate impartiality  we profess ourselves open to all parties and cannot consistently with this profession refus any performance which seems dictated by a spirit of can dour or an appearance of rational argument our correspondent therefore before he calls us partial should really prove us so and should first of all favor us with his essays in defense of mr wilkes before he pronounces positively that we will not indulge them with a place  in fact a paper to maintain a real impartiality must be actuated by the principles of justice not by the fear of censure on the one hand nor the hope of approbation on the other and the conductors of it must be more solicitous to deserve the applause of their readers than to obtain it  had the managers of the ledger for instance rejected any piece which came against the cause of mr wilkes through an apprehension of incurring the popular displeasure they would have violated the assurance of impartiality which they have so solemnly given to the public and the opponents of that gentleman would have a reasonable plea to reproach them with their palpable breach of faith to accuse them consequently of partiality argues a partiality in their accusers and it is rather unfair in those to deny others a liberty of speaking upon national affairs who constantly lay claim to such a privilege themselves  these gentlemen must however remember that though the ledger is open to all parties it is influenced by none and that the conductors to merit the good opinion of all must no more make a sacrifice of their justice at the shrine of popularity than at the altar of government they can therefore only repeat that the advocates for mr wilkes will always be as acceptable to them as any other correspondents and they call upon his friends in this manner to favor them with productions in his defense what more can be desired at their hands if the popular writers decline this candid invitation the editors of the ledger are entirely free from blame they have bound themselves in a promise of undeviating impartiality to the whole public and must by no means act inequitably to those who do oblige them with pieces for insertion out of an unreasonable deference for those who do not  this advertisement mr kelly flattered himself would effectually undeceive the public but here he was unhappily disappointed many who had repeatedly heard the charge against him never once honored the defense with a perusal while many more who really read it considered the very candor of it is declaration as a proof of criminality and would not allow any weight to the argument of justice when opposed to what they looked upon as the cause of the people  mr kelly however determined at all events to do his duty conducted the ledger on it is customary plan of impartiality and many of the most popular gentlemen who have arraigned his conduct in the capacity of a public editor well know that their letters instead of being rejected have been frequently inserted at the warning of an hour  besides a review of the ledger during mr kellys superintendency will convince the most incredulous that the severest animadversions were admitted on the proceedings of administration  it was not mr kellys fault if the publications on the contrary side were the most numerous  the correspondents of a newspaper will make it what they please and the editor is not to consider in whose favor they write but whether their writings are proper for insertion  whatever mr kellys own sentiments might be on political affairs this was the only object of his inquiry and it will appear on a retrospection of the pieces printed while he directed the ledger that mr kelly has frequently complimented popular writers on account of their abilities and civilly requested a continuation of their correspondence  as to mr kellys own letters in the ledger they appeared but occasionally from the number of volunteers who eagerly crowded to the general service yet he will heartily confess that when they did appear they were not always in favor of popularity this constitutes the second charge against him and as he is above the despicable littleness of prevaricating he will enter with confidence and he hopes with decency upon his justification  whether it has been mr kellys merit or demerit to think from principle unpopularly on the subject of the present unhappy dissensions he will not pretend to say but certainly it has been his misfortune and though several of his discreeter friends repeatedly warned him of the danger his next piece would run on the stage from an open declaration of his political opinions still he did not imagine that his profession as a public writer was to deprive him of his independence as a man  as he never presumed to be offended with the sentiments of others on matters of a national tendency he claimed a right of expressing his own and did not suppose his literary character precluded him from speaking upon a point which was the continual object of literary investigation  besides this he little conceived that the advocates for freedom of thinking would be the first to manacle the mind that the professed friends of candor would be the first to condemn without a hearing and the avowed enemies of oppression be the only persons ready to exercise an unwarrantable severity  he had at least a right to justice if he had no pretense to favor and merited surely a trial though he might afterward deserve to be condemned  the heated hour of prejudice however is not the hour of sober reflection at such a season the very virtues of our hearts frequently lead us into mistakes and we run into excesses which our cooler reason must disapprove from an actual rectitude of intention this was the case of numbers who opposed the exhibition of mr kellys play they had been told he was a despicable mercenary hired to write away their liberties and therefore considered him as a very improper candidate for public approbation  they had been informed that at the memorable trials of mr gillam and of the soldier at guildford in consequence of the unhappy affair in st georges fields he had stood forth an advocate for the effusion of innocent blood of course they beheld him with detestation and their motive was really respectable though their resentment was wholly excited by misinformation or mistake  it is true indeed mr kelly as well as an account of the two remarkable trials just mentioned wrote during the course of our domestic disunion many other papers in support of government and in vindication of parliament but he never exercised his trifling pen where he did not suppose both to be right nor delivered a single sentence that was not the result of his amplest conviction  with regard to the two trials he represented them as they really were not as they might be wished in print by the over zealous advocates of freedom  and so far was he from being once employed since his existence by administration to exert his poor abilities in their cause that he here protests before the public he never expected or received the smallest emolument for his little services  never was directly or indirectly connected with a minister in his days nor has he even at this moment though suffering so severely on account of his attachment to government either solicited or received a shilling compensation for that bread which he and his family have lost in it is defense  here possibly mr kelly may be asked how unplacd unpensiond no mans heir or slave he could be idle enough to risk the favor of a town that had honored him with the warmest marks of approbation in his first dramatic attempt for the mere purpose of serving a government from which he had not received the minutest favor or protection to this mr kelly replies that in serving government where he thought it ought to be served he looked upon himself as rendering very essential benefit to the community  knowing it the duty of every good subject to promote instead of disturbing the national tranquillity he used his humble endeavors rather to extinguish than animate the torch of public discord and strove as far as so insignificant an individual could strive to wrest it from the hand of every political enthusiast who madly attempted to set his country in flames with this view he particularly gave an account of the two trials that have exposed him to so much unmerited obloquy being well convinced that during the rage of party truth would undergo a torture upon the wheel of prejudice mr kelly determined to give a faithful narrative of these remarkable decisions he accordingly attended he accordingly gave a real state of both to the world and though he has been calumniated in the gross as a shameless abettor of murder no attempt has hitherto been made to point out in his representation the smallest perversion of a fact  this was easy to be done had he been employed as the vernisher of guilt the trials were not carried on in secret but in the full face of day not solely before the retainers of a court but before the warmest sons of popularity mr kelly was not culpable if the prisoners were wholly without blame he only acquitted those in his relation who were acquitted by the laws of their country and only explained how that innocence was made apparent which the too decissive voice of partiality had previously condemned  mr kellys account of the trials was received with general surprise because the public by a succession of papers in the daily and other prints had been taught to consider mr gillam and the soldier unquestionably guilty  on their acquittal therefore the intemperate friends to the popular cause mr kelly says the intemperate friends because he knows many of the most rational as well as the most worthy members of the community from principle in opposition wished to throw a stigma on the court where they were tried and wished to prejudice the world with an opinion that both owed their preservation more to the dexterity of judicial chicane than to their real innocence  mr kelly however by setting the transactions in a plain an honest light prevented the intended insult to the courts but drew the whole weight of party resentment upon himself and the doctrine having been long successfully inculcated among the people that whoever spoke much less whoever wrote against popular prejudices must necessarily be the hireling of government mr kelly became gradually stigmatized into such a portion of politcal consequence that the suppression of his comedy was considered as a triumph over administration so that the curtain was no sooner raised on the first night than a loud hissing prevented the performers from beginning the play a considerable time  while on the other hand the plaudits of mr kellys numerous friends to whose goodness he stands eternally indebted as well as of the unprejudiced who desired to give him a fair hearing and afterward to express their censure or approbation rendered the confusion general at last the performance commenced  but went on with incessant interruptions except only in the third act to the conclusion the performers totally disconcerted by the tumult were unable to exercise their abilities or to remember their parts  whole speeches essentially necessary to the conduct of the fable were left out and others mutilated for the sake of brevity  in short the sole consideration was to get the comedy through the five acts in any manner  this with much difficulty was ffected and it was given out for the following monday a new contest now arose the opposers of the play insisted with an uncustomary severity that it should never be exhibited again  the supporters insisted that it should on the monday according to the public intimation from mr king but mr kelly fearing the consequences of a dispute that appeared extremely serious proposed behind the scenes to withdraw his piece at once for the sake of restoring peace and the tragedy of cymbeline was given out in it is room  this conciliating measure however was not attended with the desired effect the friends of the play who were greatly the majority would by no means admit the comedy to be withdrawn and after the farce above two hundred gentlemen calling out for the manager and threatening immediate demolition to the house if a word to the wise was not performed as originally given out mr lacy the only manager then in town sent mr hopkins the prompter to assure the company it should and all terminated peaceably for that evening  it was no difficult matter to foresee that the theater on the succeeding monday night would be a scene of fresh tumult and the consequences appearing more and more alarming to mr kelly he went to mr garrick who came to town on the sunday morning to consult with him on the best means of preserving peace and it was concluded that mr kelly should wait on his friends and request that they would give up the point  mr kelly accordingly did so observing that the interests of a single individual were of little consideration when weighed against the repose of a whole public  he observed as he has repeatedly done in the course of the present narrative that prejudices had been strongly propagated against him and that the very severity he had experienced from many of his enemies though unjustifiable in the manner yet in the motive was really laudable the moment of party heat he frequently added was not the moment to reason and that however he might be injured in his circumstances by the suppression of his play he would suffer the injury with pleasure if he could by any means restore the tranquillity of the town which he had so unhappily though so innocently disturbed  to this his friends replied that the cause was not his cause now but the publics that if party disputes were once introduced into the theater our most rational amusements must be quickly at an end that the number of writers at present for the stage was sufficiently small and that they would not suffer the town to be controuled in it is pleasures from private pique or personal resentment all they contended for was a fair hearing for the piece that if it deserved condemnation they themselves would be the first to give it up but till it received an equitable trial they would not allow a triumph to prejudice professed and acknowledged partiality  in this state the affair rested till the monday evening when on mr kings appearance to speak the prologue the opposition with increased numbers hissed catcalled and threw oranges on the other side the demand for the new play was equally violent the supporters turned several out of the house whom they considered as general disturbers however mr garrick went on in the authors name with a formal renunciation of every emolument of every reputation arising from his small endeavors for the public amusement adding that he was not only ready but desirous to concur with their pleasure though to the total disappointment both of his wishes and intere and begged the sacrifice he then so cheerfully offered might be allowed to terminate the contention things nevertheless continued in the same confusion for a considerable time  during which mr garrick often retired and returned  but at last advanced with a paper in his hand from mr kelly containing a written repetition of the foregoing request and desiring permission as the only means of reestablishing harmony to withdraw his comedy wholly from the theater  when mr garrick attempted to read this paper a demand was made from the gallery to know whether it was a political production but though the demand occasioned no little laughter among the opposers of the piece it only augmented the spirit of the authors friends by rendering the views of party still more and more visible  the play of cymbeline being loudly insisted upon on the one nd was loudly prohibited on the other and near three hours having passed in acts of annoyance and hostility mr kelly was so exceedingly alarmed for the event that he ce himself into the front boxes and from the frot boxes on the galleries calling out they could not se him into the pit and there turning toward the audience he expressed his apprehensions for their safety begged they would be satisfied with what he had done which was all he had in his power to do for their preservation and not by injuring one another wound him irreparably in his peace  though in no degree so successful as he wished he nevertheless so far prevailed that a proposition on his retiring was suggested for false delicacy to be given the ensuing night for his benefit by way of compromise a gentleman then stood up in the pit and asked mr garrick whether consenting to these measures would or would not be an impediment to mr kellys bringing any future productions on the stage  to which that gentleman had no sooner given a negative than a second person from the gallery cried out expulsion means incapacitation mr kelly acquainted with these particulars went to mr garrick and declined the favor intended him  observing that he by no means meant to wring a benefit from the charity of the public  that if he deserved one benefit he was entitled to three and that the theater had already sustained sufficient loss upon his account  but mr garrick generously told him that the theater was much the best able to bear a loss though supposing the case otherwise neither he nor mr kelly as public men had a right on that occasion to dispute a determination of the public here the matter rested for that night as there was no play the money was returned and the audience retired seemingly well reconciled  notwithstanding the compromise of the foregoing evening and notwithstanding mr kelly desired that the playbills should contain no intimation that the performance of false delicacy was intended for his benefit a report universally prevailed that the opposition were determined not to suffer the exhibition of false delicacy which had long been honored with the approbation of all parties merely because it was written by the author of a word to the wise mr kelly on this imagining that the circumstance of his being to receive the profits of the night and not any objection which could be raised to an established comedy must be the sole foundation of this fresh resentment waited upon his friends and begged they would allow him to relinquish his title to these profits since they were so likely to renew the disturbances of the theater his friends however were for a long time inflexible  they pronounced a violation of the compromise no less injurious to the public than insulting to them and added that they would never have listened to any compromise if he had not been so importunately solicitous to give up every thing for peace  but mr kelly representing the prejudice the managers must necessarily sustain by a contention of the present nature between the public and pointing out the prejudice also which every individual belonging to the playhouse must as necessarily sustain by an interruption of the customary business  his friends yielded to these arguments and permitted mr kelly to forego the advantages of the night to prevent the managers and the performers from suffering in a dispute where it was equally their interest and their duty to consult the wishes of the auditors  these precautions being taken by mr kelly he repaired to the theater on the tuesday evening with some degree of satisfaction but on the opening of the play the confusion was as violent as ever though mr garrick from mr kelly assured the opposition that the play was not to be performed for the benefit of the author  this assurance however was by no means sufficient the comedy of false delicacy was written by mr kelly and therefore though in possession of the stage among the number of stock play was now to be condemned  to effect this purpose an uproar in the theater was not only judged necessary but the following hand bill was distributed at all the doors  to the public you cannot be ignorant that one wretch in that infamous banditti hired by administration to explain away the rights of an insulted people is the author of a word to the wise as a comic writer his universal want of abilities has rendered him contemptible as a politician his principles are detestable for these united reasons you were pleased to forbid the representation of his play on saturday and prevent it is performance last night  the author himself begged leave to withdraw it yet his party are now determined that you shall support the writer though you reject the play this nights representation is for his benefit shall he with impunity assume a power repugnant to your own  if the privilege of managers be imposition the duty of an english audience must be obedience  tuesday march      0 the heat with which proceedings were thus conducted on the part of opposition gave room to imagine that the audience would as upon the preceding night be dismissed without any play  but mr kellys friends were now no longer able to suppress their indignation and being determined to make no farther concessions they exerted themselves so effectually that false delicacy was performed though with very considerable interruption  whole speeches nay whole scenes were obliged to be omitted and such was the rage of undistinguishing prejudice that it even attacked the personal safety of the female performers  this was not all when the attempt to suppress false delicacy proved abortive the enemies of the author demanded their money and appeared unwilling to pay for the mischief they really did because they had not effected as much as they actually wished to do  the conclusion of the farce happily produced a general calm and though the theatrical horizon seemed pregnant with a storm the succeeding evening it is serenity still continued and perhaps will never be again disturbed by any of mr kellys productions there is nothing more necessary to add with regard to the exhibition of a wora to the wise than that such was the judicious conduct of mr garrick and mr king that what they gained on the one hand they never lost on the other  the amusement of the public had in the first insta been the only object of their attention so it was apparent the public tranquillity was in the second the only object of their care and whatever inconveniences they themselves might be exposed to they were incapable of deviating from the rules of politeness of good sense and manly condescension  after a sacrifice of his interest so ample so unreserved for the sake of restoring tranquillity in the theater it might perhaps be expected that mr kellys enemies would have thought themselves sufficiently gratified but prejudice has many appetites to glut and we seldom listen to the sentiments of justice where we have publicly committed a violence upon our reason  it was therefore no way wonderful though his cause was the common cause of letters to find many of the periodical prints constantly filled with the grossest scurrilities against him but in this they rather gratified his pride than wounded his sensibility they only exalted him on the roll of slander among the most illustrious characters in the kingdom and made him an object of importance by making him an object of implacable resentment  one attack however he cannot help mentioning in this place though it leads to a repetition of the guildford trial because it came from a quarter wholly unexpected and from a quarter also too respectable to be overlooked from the reverend mr horn at the meeting of the middlesex freeholders at mileend on friday the  0th of april at this meeting mr horn in summing up the various grievances under which he supposed the nation groaning from the tyranny of administration took occasion to descant on the soldiers trial for the murder of the unfortunate mr allen and expressed himself thus  it is necessary to give you an account of macleans trial because the judge forbad it is being taken down by any one except it was government  it has never been published  a very false account of this trial has indeed been published by mr kelly who was paid and brought to guildford for that purpose and who had lodgings taken for him there and who was familiarly conversant with a gentleman whose name i shall not mention now lest it should seem to proceed from resentment in me for an account i have to settle with him next week however one circumstance i ought to tell you this gentleman was foreman of the grand jury   without dwelling on mr hornes extraordinary tenderness to the gentleman whose name he will not mention while he points him clearly out to every apprhension mr kelly will suppose that what was asserted with regard to him mr horn himself believed to be indisputably true  nay mr kelly is seriously of this opinion because many gentlemen of unquestionable veracity have assured him that abstracted from the intemperance of party mr horn is in his understanding enlarged and in his disposition liberal on these accounts however mr kelly differed from the politician he always respected mr hornes private character and did justice to what he considered the well meaning though mistaken zeal of the soirited freeholder in the moment of his deepest concern at hearing a minister of peace preaching discord through his country and expressing an impatience of dying the vestments of his sacred function in the blood of his fellow subjects  but though mr kelly readily makes this concession in favor of mr hornes private character he must observe that the constitution of this country for the purity of which mr horn is so strenuous an advocate does not allow the mere belief of any man to be positive evidence nor compliment his simple conjecture with the force of a fact  for this reason mr horn should be extremely cautious how he asserts any thing to the prejudice of anothers reputation hearsay authority is not enough for this purpose he should know of his own knowledge what he asserts upon his own word and be certain in his proof where he is peremptory in his accusation  if a circumspection of this nature is necessary in every man of honor it must give mr horn much mortification to hear after he has represented hugh kelly to the freeholders of middlesex as a venal scribler a shameless instrument of power an atrocious defender of murder that the whole charge should be utterly groundless  that kellys account of macleans trial should be true in every circumstance that kelly never expected or received a shilling for writing it and that in the course of his days he has not once changed a syllable with mr onslow notwithstanding the conversant familiarity at guildford  strange however as all these things must appear after mr hornes positive affirmation to the contrary all these things are most religiously veritable and mr horn is in this public manner called upon to prove an iota of his charge it is his business to support his own allegations not mr kelleys to endeavor at establishing negatives  let him therefore spiritedly proceed to his proofs  he has pronounced mr kelly guilty let him now show in what his guilt consists  the most tyrannical minister can do no more than convict without evidence  in him however despotism is to be expected but surely the rigid advocate for justice will not follow so dangerous an example he will act reasonably while he contends for reason and conduct himself upon principles of legality while he is generously struggling for the preservation of the laws  in reality if there is no more foundation in mr hornes celebrated speech for the charges brought against government than for the charges urged against mr kelly the catalogue of public grievances is rather ludicrous than melancholy but without troubling mr horn to support his assertions mr kelly will show these very assertions selfrefuted he will prove them as inconsistent as they are positive and rest his defense entirely on the nature of mr hornes accusation  mr horn sets out with saying that the judge would not suffer the trial to be taken down by any body except it was for government  several nevertheless took it down and among the rest mr chinnery and mr gurney the professed short hand writers  numbers besides committed the most material passages to paper and some to mr kellys knowledge not for government but mr kelly will say that had he been hired by administration for the infamous purpose mr horn mentions it is not likely that the use of a pen would have been at all permitted in the court it is not likely that the judge would allow a real account of a trial to be taken where a prostitute writer was particularly employed to misrepresent it nor is it likely that the ministry while wishing to stand well with the world would furnish such palpable evidence of it is own dishonor  if there was any thing illegal in the proceeding of the court  if an unwarrantable stretch of power rescued the prisoner from justice why has not the transaction been held up to universal in dignation  why is it not recorded in the list of grievances presented to the throne  to make a solemn court of judicature the pandar of despotic authority would have been a crime of the first magnitude it would have shaken the constitution to it is center and overwhelmed the minister with inevitable destruction  but wicked as some gentlemen in opposition might suppose the government they could not suppose it weak enough to overturn the laws thus desperately at once for the mere end of saving a private foot soldier from punishment a pardon was an easy expedient and mercy was not then considered criminal  besides were the ostensible men in power as ruthless as they have been painted they would have given the prisoner up at once they would have been regardless of his fate nor would they have attempted to save him from the gibbet by methods that must have unavoidably hurried themselves to the block the question is not whether the unhappy mr allen lost a son but whether that son fell by the hands of maclean  humanity is melted when it thinks of a slaughtered child and a weeping father  but humanity must still be just  it must not with for victims without guilt nor dry up the tears of sorrowing relations with a sacrifice of unoffending blood  the last part of mr hornes assertion is to the full as extraordinary as the first mr kelly is made culpable for being farmiliarly conversant with the foreman of the grand jury at guildford though certainly if there was a necessity for any mention of the grand juryman he ought to be mentioned with respect because the grand jury found the bill against maclean and consequently in that circumstance advanced the very wishes of popularity  instead therefore of condemning mr kelly for his intimacy with mr onslow in the present case that intimacy ought to be an argument in mr kellys favor  but the truth is mr kelly in the whole course of his existence never once spoke to mr onslow the grand juryman alluded to knowing who he was nor he believes at any rate because he knows mr onslows person and is flattered with the possession of a tolerable memory  however if mr horn has evidence to the contrary  let him produce it  if not let him for the future be more certain of his facts or less peremptory in his assertions  but possibly though mr horn is a strong enemy to examination by interrogatory he may nevertheless choose to ask mr kelly what business carried him to guildford if he did not go as a literary prostitute in favor of government to this mr kelly will reply with another question what business had mr horn there mr kelly surely has as much right to indulge his curiosity and to support what he conceives a just cause as that gentleman  mr horn cannot be a warmer well wisher to true freedom and to national happiness than mr kelly though he pursues a very different plan of promoting them  mr kellys political opinions may be erroneous  but his intention is right  had he been the venal thing he is represented he might have carried his venality to a certain market  popular applause is always fortune to a public writer of prudence and the part mr kelly has taken may be an impeachment of his judgment but argues no depravity of his heart  upon the whole with regard to mr horn if mr kellys account of the guildford trial i false let mr horn point the fallacy out if mr kelly has been hired to write it let mr horn mention by whom  and if it is criminal to be familiarly conversant with mr onslow let mr horn support a single instance of mr kellys familiarity with that gentleman  mr horn soon after mr kellys account of the guildford trial appeared promised the world a true state of that remarkable affair and if mr kelly shamefully misrepresented facts the appearance of mr hornes pamphlet was doubly necessary  that pamphlet has never yet appeared and it cannot be supposed that a temper so ready to fire at light occasions as mr hornes would suppress it had there been any material cause of complaint to lay before the people  mr kelly has taken up a great deal of room with his trifling concerns for which he ought to apologize but as the publication of his play by subscription proceeded entirely from the generous partiality of his friends he thought it his duty to let them at least see that though they might be supporting a dull writer they were encouraging an honest man  the piece with all it is imperfections on it is head is now before the world and the author hopes if it should even set the reader fast asleep that nothing it contains will rouse his indignation the most careful father he thinks may put it into the hands of his daughter without any fear of wounding her delicacy or unhinging her principles  this is it is chief perhaps it is only merit and perhaps had it been heard on the stage with patience it might have been condemned with justice  mr kelly will therefore console himself with his optimist willoughby by thinking every thing happens for the best and look upon that very prejudice which has suppressed his poor performance as ultimately fortunate since it may have been the means of preserving his little share of reputation  he cannot however conclude this address without an observation or two upon the melancholy situation of dramatic writers  and as it is possible that he himself may never more venture a production on the stage he hopes what he has further to advance will merit an additional consideration from his readers  the great decline of dramatic genius in this country has been for many years an object of general concern with the public and the lovers of the theater have ardently wished that some happy stimulus might be discovered to increase the number of writers for the stage yet though this wish has prevailed universally and though the credit as well as the emolument arising from a successful play is not a little tempting still the danger attending the representation of the best pieces is so considerable that the few writers blessed with easy fortunes do not choose to run the hazard and most of those who live by the sale of their productions are content to follow studies less profitable for a more certain reward of their labors  besides this the difficulty the toil the downright drudgery of writing a good play is inconceivable it is a work which requires long time and a close application it is a work in which neither the most extensive erudition nor the most accurate understanding can ensure an author success  in every other species of composition judgment genius and education are almost certain of a triumph  but here knowledge of the world is indispensibly requisite  an acquaintance with the manners and with the passions is requisite  nor are these sufficient without an invention to strike out variety and a skill to produce effects by a forcible display of situation  it is not the good sense only of an audience which is addressed  but their feelings they must be agreeably surprised while they are publicly instructed and the muse like other beauties must be ravishing to the general eye before she can be dear to the general heart  when therefore the difficulty attending a dramatic work is so considerable when perhaps there is another considerable difficulty to get a play received by the stage and another still to find a capital company of performers to represent it instead of wondering that the number of writers is so small we should in reality wonder how it is so respectable  but if we look still farther we shall be surprised that any author risks his bark upon the dangerous ocean of the theater  it is a melancholy truth that the people who write most for the stage are rather remarkable for their ingenuity than their opulence  on this account a disappointment to them is an essential misfortune yet a few private enemies can at all times frustrate their expectations in vain an unfortunate man of letters may labor for many months with a laudable view of entertaining the town and improving his own circumstances  and in vain he may exert his utmost efforts to merit the protection of an audience if he has unhappily given one individual an offense the moment his piece is talked of a party is possibly formed to damn it and many who would not join this party from malevolence give it countenance for the pleasure as it is called of kicking up a riot in the playhouse  thus the littleness of personal pique and the levity of inconsiderate laughter have the poet totally at their mercy  the curtain rises and the storm begins nor can the generous interposition of nine tenths among the auditors preserve the play from destruction there is as much confusion created by the desire of go on go on as by the cry go off go off whatever disturbs the representation has a tendency to injure it so that a performance exhibited during a state of contention must despair of success  the supporters constantly interrupted have no opportunity of being entertained and naturally enough perhaps attribute the fault to the author while the opposition decisively pronouncing upon what is predetermined not to hear kindly brands him with the epithet of an incorrigible dance and not content with the injury done to his fortune makes an equal attack upon his literary character  such being the situation of dramatic genius in this country let the public themselves judge whether an author has any mighty encouragement to write for the stage  perhaps the poet treated in the manner now described has no dependence but his talents perhaps upon the success of the very piece thus suppressed he built his chief establishment in life and founded every future prospect of bringing up a growing family with reputation  what must his feelings then be to find his hopes all blasted in a single hour  to find the very labor possibly of years destroyed in an instant by the people for whose entertainment he labored and to see the bread not only wrested from the hands of his unoffending little ones but to see them even exposed to the still persecuting resentment of prejudice for the imaginary offenses of their father  what must be his feelings  yet forbear humanity to inquire  the answer will harrow up your bosom  generosity turn away from the picture it must deluge you with tears  the scene of poetical distress however sketched to the readers imagination thanks to the goodness of providence is far from being mr kellys situation but it often has been and often may be the situation of a much worthier man  mr kelly is affluent beyond his merits  nay beyond his utmost hopes he possesses the riches of content in a very extensive manner and can sit down to his humble repast with pleasure in the honest recollection that it is punctually paid for  the difficulties here pointed out for dramatic genius to encounter are difficulties to which every writer for the stage is constantly exposed but the danger becomes infinitely more formidable if in times of party feud he renders himself in the least disagreeable to the popular side of the question the unreflecting virtue of numbers then as in mr kellys case will arm against him and think it meritorious to condemn the production that punishment may be inflicted upon the imputed delinquency of the man  in times like the present therefore what is a dramatic writer to do  to hold his tongue replies cold blooded prudence  and what has the unfortunate man of letters committed that he alone of all the community is to be denied the privilege of speaking his sentiments say ye various sons of science will you submit to this despicable slavery of the mind are you above the generality of mankind distinguished for your education and your understanding to be refused an opinion where an opinion is deemed the birthright of your meanest fellowsubject shall it be your glory to inculcate lessons of generosity and independence and yet be your crime to practice these lessons yourselves  shall your writings breathe the noblest spirit of candor and your lives be a round of the poorest dissimulation  shall you think your country in danger and yet be afraid to speak a syllable for it is preservation  no you will not tear the siner principles from your breasts you will not set an example of so abject a disingenuity  whatever meets the approbation of your judgment will be supported by the sanction of your voice and however you may meet with reproach you will at least be careful not to deserve it  when administration is indefensible you will be too honest to combat in it is cause but at the same time you will not hesitate to condemn the errors of popularity  you will be always animated by a real solicitude for the public and be as careful to guard against the extravagance of it is overzealous friends as to provide against the machinations of it is most politic enemies  acting thus you may be poor but you will ever be respectable  posterity will do you justice if you are even oppressed by your cotemporaries and you will find ample resources in the consciousness of your integrity to compensate for the severest disappointments in your fortune  to conclude  if men of talents have an equal right of thinking with the rest of their fellow subjects and if they are not precluded by the generally acknowledged superiority of their understandings from declaring their sentiments upon subjects of national importance the lovers of the drama must see that nothing can be so dangerous to the existence of genius as the introduction of political disputes into the theater the party which condemns a writer of different principles on one day may see a favorite author sacrificed the very next by their enemies in politics and the violence may continue till there is scarcely an individual hardy enough to furnish our managers with a piece the state of the stage is at present sufficiently deplorable and it is literature instead of wanton opposition calls loudly for the generous hand of public encouragement  give it this encouragement therefore ye wise and ye worthy  rescue your writers from the worst of all tyrannies and no longer form your minds by the sentiments of those who are not allowed to possess any minds of

willing to be pleased  say do you wish for bravo  fine  encore  or  hiss  off off  no more  no more  no more  though for true tasle i know the warmth you feel a roasted poet is a glorious meal  and often i have known a miserable wit through downright laughter fastnd on the spit basted with catcall sauce for very fun not till quite ready  but till quite undone  and yet you served the puppy as you ought  how dare be think to tell you of a fault  what fair one here from prudence ever strays what lover here ever flatters or betrays what husband here is ever found to roam what wife is here that does not dote on home in yon gay circle not a blooming ace from clubs rude king could point you out the face no sober trader in that crowed pit till clear broad day will over his bottle sit nor while our commerce fatally decays erect his villa or set up his chaise  nay you above in cakeconsuming bowers who through whole sundays munge away your hours you are so mild so gentle that even here your sweet tond voices never wound the ear never make the house for tune or prologue ring roastbeef  roastbeef  the prologue prologue  king  why then thus weighed in truths severest scale shall each pert scribbler impudently rail with dull morality disgrace the stage and talk of vices in so pure an age your wise forefathers in politer days had even their faults commended in their plays to cheat a friend or violate a wife was then true humor comedy and life  but now the bard becomes your highest boast whose illbred pen traduces you the most whose saucy mase can hardily aver that still a lady possibly can err that still a lord can trick you at a bet and fools and madmen are existing yet  be roused at lest  nor in an age so nice let these grave dunces teize you with advice  what though some taylors often protracted bill may hang all trembling on the authors quill regard it not remove the growing evil  a well dressed poet is the very devil  do taverns dun him  what can scribblers treat fine times indeed when scribblers think to eat  do justice then  tonight ten minutes here may blast the bards whole labor of a year  what do i see  resentment in your eyes it is true the fellow at your mercy lies and of all wreaths the britons noblest crown is never to strike an enemy when down   a word to the wise act i scene an apartment in sir john dormers house enter sir john dormer miss dormer and miss montagu sir john well but my dear caroline though i grant you that sir george hastings has his peculiarities still you must grant me that he has many very amiable qualities   miss dormer i never denied sir georges merit sir but all his good qualities cannot conceal his unaccountable coxcombry his attention is constantly centered in himself and there is no enduring a man who fancies that every woman must at first sight fall violently in love with him   sir john do you hear her miss montagu   miss montagu why sir john there is no accounting for inclination you know  however i cannot look upon sir george in the very ridiculous light he appears to miss dormer   miss dormer no  why he is a narcissus that continually makes love to his own shadow and i cannot bear the idea of a husband in whose affection i am likely to be every moment rivaled by the lookingglass   miss montagu nay now my dear you are rather hard upon him  sir george may possibly be a little too fond of himself    sir john but that doesnt prevent him from entertaining very tender sentiments for caroline dormer   miss montagu he may be unnecessarily attentive to the niceties of dress    sir john but then he is attentive to every law of justice and generosity   miss montagu and if his foibles provoke us to an occasional smile his worth must always excite our warmest admiratiun   miss dormer upon my word harriot a very florid winding up of a period and very proper for an elevated thought in a sentimental comedy  but i tell you i should relish these encomiums on sir george well enough if he was not so particularly recommended to my attention  i really cannot support the imagination of vowing honor and obedience to the object of my own ridicule and it would mortify my pride beyond conception to see my husband the constant jest of his acquaintance   sir john my dear caroline dont be too difficult in your choice nor entertain any romantic idea of finding a husband all perfection  the expectation of too much before marriage frequently imbitters the union after  and as the best men will have their little blemishes we may farley number those among the best in whose characters we can discover nothing more than a few trisling peculiarities   miss dormer i see sir you make a point of this affair   sir john i would not make a point of any thing my dear which i thought would be in the least repugnant to your happiness  but really when i consider this proposal in every respect when i consider the rank the fortune and what is above all the merit of the man i cannot but with that you would give him a favorable reception and this the more especially as i am convinced if the match should take place that your fine sense and sweetness of temper will easily mould your husband to your wish and quickly remove every trace of those foibles which are at present the only reason of your objection   miss dormer you are very good sir   sir john this morning my dear sir george purposes to declare himfelf in form  if you can receive his addresses you will make him happy and oblige me exceedingly  but if you cannot deal ingenuously and reject him the justice which i owe to him as well as the tenderness which i have for you makes this advice doubly recpsite   enter a servant servant mrwilloughby sir   sir john i will wait upon him instantly exit serve think therefore seriously caroline before you determine for i neither wish to cheat my friend into the possession of a reluctant heart nor to sacrifice my daughter to the object of her aversion exit   miss dormer well harriot what shall i do  you hear he has actually mentioned him to me in the most serious terms and that this very morning he is to make a formal declaration   miss montagu and what then doesnt sir john desire you to reject him if he is really disagreeable  can you possibly wish for a greater degree of indulgence   miss dormer and yet that very indulgence my dear miss montagu is likely to render me extremely miserable   miss montagu why indeed miss dormer  remember child you complimented me first with the cold respectful epithet of miss  the men in general say that the surest way of making a woman wretched is to indulge her inclinations  but pray my dear why is this liberty which sir john allows you of promoting your own happiness so very likely to make you miserable   miss dormer ah harriot dont you see that while he is so generously anxious to consult my wishes i am bound by gratitude as well as justice to pay the greatest regard to his expectations   miss montagu you are really an excellent girl my dear but pray answer me one question seriously   miss dormer what is it   miss montague is this dislike which you entertain to your fathers choice entirely the result of your aversion to sir george or is it be honest now the consequence of a secret partiality for somebody else   miss dormer a secret partiality for somebody else pray my dear for whom is it likely i should entertain a partiality   miss montagu caroline caroline this reserve is ill suited both to the nature of our friendship and the customary frankness of your temper  yet notwithstanding the secresy you have hitherto so unkindly observed i can easily see that mr villars  what conscious caroline   miss dormer o harriot spare me  nor be offended that i have endeavored to keep a secret from you which i absolutely shudder to whisper to myself  to deal heartily my dear i must acknowledge that your charge is but too just  and notwithstanding every effort of my pride and every argument of my prudence i find this humble yet deserving villars possesses a much higher place in my esteem than can be consistent with my happiness   miss montagu why to do the young fellow justice he is really very agreeable and has something in his manner that would do credit to a more eligible situation  but    miss dormer ay harriot there is the misfortune  agreeable as he is in every respect he is still a total dependent on my father and thinks himself extremely happy that his talents have obtained him even a temporary establishment in an opulent family   miss montagu well my dear sir john is generous and mr villars is very useful to him in his literary researches besides i am not a little pleased at the distinction with which he as well as the captain constantly treats mr villars   miss dormer i dont know how it is  mr villars has a manner of commanding respect from every body he is humble without servility and spirited    miss montagu oh he is every thing that is amiable no doubt  and the stars have been exceedingly relentless in not giving him a large fortune  however if i have any skill in the business of the heart villars is to the full as uneasy upon your account as you can possibly be on his  he is always contriving excuses for conversing with you yet when he does he is in visible confusion and it was only yesterday evening when i begged he would put a letter for me into the post office that he stammerd out in the utmost perplexity i shall take particular care madam to deliver it to miss dormer   miss dormer if this be the case harriot i must indeed behave with particular circumspection to him and yet though i see the impossibility of ever being his he has given me an insuperable aversion to the rest of his sex   miss montagu what then do you intend to do with sir george   miss dormer to reject him but still to do it without giving any offense to my father   miss montagu and how do you propose to manage it   miss dormer by throwing myself honestly upon sir georges humanity by telling him my affection is engaged and by begging of him to withdraw his addresses in such a manner as shall appear to be the result of his own choice and not the consequence of my disinclination  sir george notwithstanding his egregious vanity is uncommonly goodnatured  but let us retire to my room my dear i am unfit for company at present and here we are likely to be broken in upon  o harriot   miss montagu and o caroline what a very foolish figure does a woman make when she is lamentably in love exeunt   enter sir george hastings and captain dormer dormer well my brotherinlaw elect  you are very splendidly dressed this morning   sir george why jack i think i do make a pretty tolerable appearance   dormer and do you think this appearance calculated to make an impression upon a woman of spirit  zounds man give up your pretensions for nothing but a fellow of life is likely to succeed with my sister i can promise you   sir george a fellow of life jack  that is i suppose a fellow of profligacy  truly you pay your sister a very pretty compliment   dormer and why pray do you necessarily connect the idea of life with the idea of profligacy   sir george because in the vocabulary of libertines like you jack the word life always means a round of every thing that is foolish or unwarrantable   dormer why what the devil are you turned fanatic george that you begin to deal so much in secondhand morality   sir george in short your fellows of spirit never allow a man a scruple of commonsense till he has entirely prostituted his understanding nor suppose him to be fit for a commerce with the world till he absolutely merits to be hunted out of society   dormer well but george there is one excess of which you yourself have been guilty and i have known the time when you took a bottle so freely that you were generally made toastmaster of the company   sir george yes but i soon found out that drinking was detestable and toasting the greatest of all absurdities   dormer why how would you wish to pass an evening  can any thing exceed the pleasure of society with a few select friends of goodnature and vivacity   sir george o nothing to be sure is so delightful as guzzling down half a dozen bottles and enjoying the rational discourse  of where does the toast stand  with you sir william  no with you sir george  fill him a bumper captain dormer  fill him to the top  o an evening spent in this manner must be delectable especially if a couple of fools should happily quarrel in their cups and cut one anothers throat to prove the superiority of their understanding   dormer ha ha ha  but was this all your objection to the bottle   sir george no for it made my heach ach and disordered my dress beyond bearing   dormer disordered your dress ha ha ha what unaccountable coxcombry   sir george why to be sure it is a very ridiculous thing for a man to show a little regard for decency   dormer well notwithstanding you are a coxcomb systematically i am sure the character will not be a strong recommendation to my sister   sir george your sister jack is a woman of sense and must see that she has a much stronger chance of being happy with me than poor miss montagu has of being happy with her brother  my heart is unadulterated and is therefore worth any womans acceptance   dormer o no doubt it is a very valuable acquisition   sir george whereas you fellows of life hawk about your hearts from commoner to commoner till they become quite contemptible and then with the additional merit of broken constitutions  tottering limbs  pale cheeks and hollow eyes you politely offer the refuse of the stews to ladies of fortune family and character   dormer and so your affection is unadulterated  ha ha ha   sir george ay laugh on and welcome  but who have we here   dormer mr willoughby who will keep you in countenance with maxims of musty morality   sir george what my goodnatured optimist who thinks every thing happens for the best   dormer ay candide to perfection who is continually blessing his stars the more they load him with misfortunes  and pray heaven his business here this morning has not been to talk with sir john about my intimacy in his family aside   enter willoughby willoughby sir george your most obedient  captain i am your humble servant   sir george mr willoughby yours  how do the ladies sir  the good mrs willoughby and your amiable daughter   willoughby why my daughter sir george is very well  and my wife is as usual continually embittering every comfort of life and lamenting the miseries attendant on mortality   sir george i wonder she does not choose to follow the sensible example you set her and endeavor rather to lessen than to aggravate the measure of unavoidable misfortunes  she is a young woman and misanthropy at her age is rather out of character   willoughby why yes sir george she is twenty good years younger than i am and yet she is twenty times more impatient under the smallest disappointment   sir george but my good friend you dont think her youth a very unfortunate circumstance   willoughby o sir george my principle is to think every thing for the best   dormer well said mr willoughby   willoughby it wasnt her youth however that struck me but the sobriety of her conduct and her affection for my daughter  she was besides a distant relation of my first wifes  lived with us in the same house and some how i liked her because having no fortune it gave her but little expectation of a better husband   sir george but why dont you teach her to adopt some part of your own fortitude under disappointment   dormer perhaps it is not in her power to exercise so desirable a philosophy   willoughby my dear captain life has misfortunes enough without our being industrious to increase the number of them  when an accident therefore happens we should consider that bad as it may be it might have been still worse and instead of arrogantly murmuring at the dispensations of providence we should thankfully acknowledge the goodness that did not plunge us into a deeper degree of affliction   sir george upon my word i think there is much reason in this argument   willouchby ay and much policy too sir george  we should always imagine that every thing happens for the best  about ten years ago i broke my leg by a fall from a horse    dormer and pray did this prove a fortunate accident   willoughby yes for your father who generously pitied my situation got my place continued to my family so that if i drop off tomorrow there is a comfortable provision for them  indeed when the accident happened i could not foresee this consequence  however i made the best of matters  was thankful that i had not broke both my legs and drew a kind of negative good fortune from a stroke of real calamity   sir george why what the devil is this fellow dormer laughing at   dormer why how the devil can i help laughing when the very evils of life are made so many indirect instruments of happiness   willoughby oh let him laugh sir george he can by no means joke me out of my sentiments  why when my son was stolen from me in his infancy  i found a consolation in reflecting that i had not lost my daughter too  and though i have never since been able to hear any account of my poor boy i am satisfied he was taken from me for the best and i bear my lot with resignation   dormer how do you set down the loss of your son in the chapter of fortunate accidents   sir george negatively he may dormer for he might have turned out a libertine like yourself and in that case his being lost is indeed a very fortunate circumstance   dormer very smart truly  but i suppose you bear your lot with resignation too sir george  for you have lately got a good two thousand a year by the death of this young fellows godfather old webly the humorist and it is your interest to pray that he never may be found as there is a certain clause in the will you know which    sir george which obliges me to invest him with this estate if ever he is discovered  a mighty hardship really and you must be a very pretty fellow to suppose it any way difficult for an honest man to do a common act of justice   willoughby all for the best still captain  sir george we are certain will do good with his fortune  whereas had it been possessed by my boy  how am i sure that it would not be applied to very different purposes  yet who knows that it might either  who knows but  however stisting his emotion i am positive every thing happened for the best  and so  and so a good morning to you exit   sir george poor man how sensibly he feels the loss of his son notwithstanding his endeavors to be cheerful  but what am i throwing away my time upon you for when i have business of so much importance with your sister good bye jack and now let us see if profligates only are to meet encouragement from the ladies exit   dormer ha ha ha was there ever such a compound of sentiment and vanity  caroline must keep the fellow in a glass case or he will kill himself before the honeymoon is over with the fatigue of seeing company going   enter sir john sir john jack jack come back a little  i want a word or two with you   dormer i feared as much aside what are your commands sir   sir john why jack i need not tell you how anxious i am to have you settled in the world nor is it necessary for me to put you in mind of the engagement i entered into with my late worthy friend sir ralph montagu   dormer i know your obliging solicitude for me extremely well sir and i feel it with the most grateful sensibility  but sure there is yet time enough before i undertake the important charge of a family   sir john come come you have seen enough of the world to become if you please a useful member of society  besides miss montagu is now without a father and should be treated with an additional degree of attention  nothing therefore can be more improper than to keep a young lady of her merit and fortune waiting for the result of your determination when you ought to think it a very great honor that she can be prevailed upon to receive you as a husband   dormer miss montagu sir will i dare say be no way offended at the delay if i can judge from the indifference with which she constantly behaves to me   sir john and how can she behave otherwise when you constantly treat her with indifference  to be plain with you however jack i fear you are too wild too dissipated to think seriously  you moreover possess a spirit of gallantry which gives me many an uneasy moment  and i am not a little troubled at your continual visits to mr willoughbys   dormer to mr willoughby sir  to your own particular friend   sir john yes and the more i esteem him the more uneasy i must naturally be at your visiting there so frequently  miss willoughby has a fine person and a feeling heart she thinks besides i have obliged her father and may in the fullness of her gratitude imbibe sentiments for the son of his benefactor  take care therefore take care gallantry though a fashionable crime is a very detestable one and the wretch who pilfers from us in the hour of his necessity is an innocent character compared to the plunderer who wantonly robs us of happiness and reputation   dormer i hope sir i shall never do any thing to bring a reflection upon the honor of my family   sir john i hope not jack and therefore i could wish you were not a man of gallantry  to engage the confidence of the innocent on purpose to betray it is as mean as it is inhuman   enter a servant servant every thing is ready in the library sir   sir john very well  exit serve come jack think a little on what i have said  in my son let me for once find a friend  the honor of my family is now materially trusted in your hands and though my tenderness for you may feel at any prostitution of that honor be assured that my justice will never allow me to pardon it exit sir john   enter villars dormer well villars i fancy willoughby has at last made a complaint to my father for i am commanded in the most positive terms to think of an immediate marriage with miss montagu   villars and is not it by much the most sensible course you can follow  miss montagu is a very fine young lady   dormer true  but you have never seen miss willoughby   villars besides the great fortune    dormer miss willoughby   villars that courts your acceptance if i may so express myself    dormer miss willoughby   villars oh  i see how it is  and are you then determined to marry miss willoughby   dormer not so fast  not quite so fast my dear villars i beg of you  miss willoughby certainly possesses a greater share of my affection than any other woman in the world and i dont know if my father could be brought to approve of such a match that i should find the least disinclination to marry her  but as matters stand at present there is no likelihood of such a circumstance and therefore i would not choose to disoblige sir john in so material a point especially as my wishes with regard to miss willoughby may possibly be indulged without so considerable a sacrifice   villars i dont understand you   dormer why miss willoughby knew all along of my engagement with miss montagu and consequently had no reason to suppose that my intentions could be very matrimonial besides she let nobody into the secret of my addresses but her ridiculous stepmother who is a miserable compound of avarice and affectation  indeed to do the young lady justice it was a considerable time before she would hear a syllable of a tender nature from me on account of my connection with miss montagu   villars and how did you manage it at last   dormer why in the customary manner  i talked a damned deal of nonsense with a very tragical tone and a very melancholy countenance  exclaimed against the tyranny of fathers who wanted to force the inclinations of their children from despicable motives of interest  and cursed the poor stars for giving her so much beauty and making me so sensible of it  then pressing her tenderly by the hand i usually ran out of the room as if in violent emotion affecting to gulp down a torrent of tears and left her own pity to be my advocate the moment she recovered the use of her recollection   villars what and did this auswer your purpose sir   dormer oh perfectly the women are inconceivably fond of the pathetic and listen to you with rapture if you talk about death or distraction  spring but the mine of their pity you soon blow their hearts into a flame  and reap more service from an hour of complete substantial misery than from a whole year of the most passionate adoration   villars well captain and may i presume to ask what use you intend to make of miss willoughoys partiality for you   dormer why faith villars that is a very puzzling question upon the whole  notwithstanding all my levity you know i have the deepest reverence for my father and he must not be disobliged upon any account  though to deal honestly with you i have no mighty inclination to miss montagu   villars and what must become of poor miss willoughby   dormer why i shoudnt like to be a rascal there neither  yet what can one do  where a womans weak enough to encourage the addresses of a man whom she knows to be preengaged she gives him a kind of title to deceive her  besides villars miss willoughby has herself shown a genius for duplicity in this affair which should make a man of any sense a little considerate   villars how so pray   dormer dont you recollect she has deceived her father through the whole transaction and it is a maxim with me that the woman who can forget the sentiments of nature has half an inclination to forget the sentiments of virtue   villars poor miss willoughby   dormer you are mightily concerned for a woman you never saw in your life however be easy  i am as sentimental for a libertine you know as any fellow in the kingdom and it shall be miss willoughbys own fault if matters are carried to extremities  but villars step with me to my agents and well talk farther on this subject  few people despise money more than myself and yet there are few to whom a snug sum would at this moment be more acceptable   villars you promise me then that in this affair of miss willoughbys    dormer zounds villars i will not brag too much neither  i am still flesh and blood  and these make a very dangerous composition in the hour of love and opportunity   villars my dear captain this is no jesting matter  the happiness of a deserving young lady is at stake and a laugh will but poorly repay a violation of your honor or a breach of your humanity exeunt   end of the first act act ii scene willoughbys house enter mr and mrs willoughby mrs wllloughby and so my prudenr sage considerate dear you have actually advited sir john dormer to restrain his sons visits to our house   willoughby yes that was my business at sir johns this morning   mrs willoughby and you imagine this wise measure will turn out for the best i suppose   willoughby i do really    mrs willoughby what you think it for the best to let your poor family continue always in obscurity  and look upon it as a great unhappiness whenever they have the least chance of rising in the world   willoughby and you think i have done a mighty foolish thing in preserving the peace as well as the honor of my poor family from the greatest of all misfortunes   mrs willoughby from the greatest of all misfortunes did any body ever hear the like  why i tell you captain dormer is in love passionately in love with your daughter   willoughby so much the worse    mrs willoughby so much the worse this is the only thing in which you ever forgot your all for the best principle  so much the worse so much the better i tell you  and in all likelihood he might have married her if your ridiculous fear of being happy had not put sir john upon his guard to prevent so desirable a circumstance   willoughby what madam would you have me trepan the only son of my benefactor into a marriage with my daughter and at a time too when i know him engaged to a lady of miss montagus family and fortune  o mrs willoughby i am ashamed of these arguments and if there is no way to be rich without being despicable let us look upon poverty as the most eligible of all situations   mrs willoughby dont tell me of miss montagus family mr willoughby your daughter is not her inferior in that respect  besides a woman of beauty educated as i have educated cornelia even if she has not altogether so much money has merit enough to deserve the first man in the kingdom  i am sure if i was a single woman again    willoughby you have been a single woman madam and are now married to a fellow old enough for your father   mrs willoughby i dont deserve to be reproached by you mr willoughby  you are at least a gainer by my pity   willoughby i think so my deari think all for the best   mrs willoughby what all for the best my marrying a man as old as my father  have a little gratitude mr willoughby   willoughby well well my dear  it is foolish for a man and wife to quarrel because they must make it up again  however we were here talking of captain dormer  and what is our girls beauty and education to the purpose   mrs willoughby very much to the purpose  they show there would have been no impropriety in suffering captain dormer to marry cornelia and they show that you behaved very absurdly in striving to prevent the advancement of your own daughter   willoughby madam madam young women are apt enough to err of themselves but a father has indeed a great deal to answer for who exposes his daughter to unnecessary temptations  captain dormer has been already too successful in some families of our acquaintance and if while we are contriving to trap him into a marriage with cornelia he should find it possible to rob her of her honor we shall be very properly punished for the baseness of our designs   mrs willoughby and do you think that possible after the share i have had in her education  though i am but her motherinlaw    willoughby my good wife it is by supposing our own children wiser than the children of other people that so many are constantly ruined  if we are desirous therefore of preserving them unsullied we should always keep them out of danger  but our ridiculous partiality constantly paints them in the most flattering colors or perfection and we never suppose them capble of committing the smallest mistake till they  totally undone   mrs willoughby well it is in vain to talk with you  but remember i say you will always be the enemy of your own family   willoughby i shall always endeavor madam to act as becomes a father  but i shall also strive to act as becomes an honest man  and therefore captain dormer shall have no more interviews with my daughter   mrs willoughby no    willoughby no  my avarice shall neither lead me to injure the happiness of my friends family nor shall my weakness betray the honor of my own  every thing will i dare say turn out for the best though if the worst should happen i shall still find a consolation in having taken every justifiable method to prevent it exit   enter miss willoughby miss willoughby o madam i have heard all  what will become of me   mrs willoughby ah my poor dear child was there ever so preposterous a fool as your father   miss willoughby dear madam say something to comfort me  you have kindly made yourself the confidant of my sentiments for captain dormer and i must be the most miserable creature in the world if my father is inflexibly determined to drive him from the house   mrs willoughby i can say nothing to you cornelia but what must add to your regret  there is no hope of any favorable turn in the affairs of our family  day after day produces fresh disappointments and instead of having any agreeable prospect to cheer us as we go on the view becomes more and more clouded with misfortunes  no there is no enduring life upon these terms  no there is no possibility of enduring it   miss willoughby o that i had never seen captain dormer  or that he had been less amiable    mrs willoughby ah my dear child i know but too well how to pity your distress  i have been in love myself strangely as he now neglects my advice i was once very desperately in love with your father  he was the first man that ever said a tender thing to me  and mexico if he was dead tomorrow would not purchase a single glance of regard for another nor the mines of peru obtain a smile of approbation   miss willoughby well madam it is happy for me that you have yourself been susceptible of the softer impressions since that susceptibility has induced you to assist me during my acquaintance with captain dormer   mrs willoughby it is happy for you cornelia and it shall be happy for you  my tenderness is more than the tenderness of a stepmother  and there is nothing i admire so much as constancy in love  my thoughts therefore have not been idle on this affair and i believe you will allow my understanding to be tolerable   miss willoughby the whole world concurs in an opinion of your goodsense madam but few entertain a higher idea of it than captain dormer   mrs willoughby the captain my dear is a man of taste and discernment   miss willoughby and yet i must give him up for ever   mrs willoughby it is your own fault  why will not you take my advice and make him yours securely  there is but one way    miss willoughby o madam you know my abhorrence of an elopement  i have often told you    mrs willoughby yes and i have often told you  that your fathers forgiveness may be easily obtained  but that dormer once married to that harriot montagu is lost for ever  do you imagine child i would advise you to an impropriety   miss willoughby but how can i betray the dignity of my sex in proposing so bold a measure to the captain   mrs willoughby to be sure it is very bold in a woman who has given away her heart to make an honorable offer of her hand to a lover  however stay child  let poor dormer be forced into this marriage with miss montagu  let him be torn irrecoverably from you  and let your obstinacy like your fathers continually counteract the happiness of your family  were you once mrs dormer very handsome things might be done for mr willoughby   miss willoughby o madam dont attack me in so tender a point   mrs willoughby come up stairs child  suspecting your fathers business to sir john dormers this morning and dreading the consequence i have packed up all your things ready for an expedition to scotland  you must determine therefore instantly  and if you determine to have dormer you must act instantly too   miss willoughby what will become of me   mrs willoughby i dont know what will become of you if you dont take my advice  and i am sure on the present occasion i give you advice that would be very agreeable to half the young ladies within the bills of mortality exeunt   the scene changes to a room at sir john dormers miss dormer and sir george discovered sir george nay my dear miss dormer there is no bearing so unjust an insensibility to the power of your own attractions   miss dormer indeed sir george you overrate my little merits exceedingly  and probably the greatest i can boast is my consciousness of their being contracted within a very limited circle   sir george well madam the very modesty which induces you to decline every pretension to the admiration of the world is but a fresh proof how greatly you deserve it   miss dormer you have much politeness sir george but politeness is your peculiar characteristic    sir george at least madam i have much sincerity  and if sir johns mediation in my favor together with as fervent an attachment as ever warmed the bosom can obtain a look of approbation from miss dormer she may rest satisfied that the business of my life will be an unremitting solicitude for the advancement of her happiness   miss dormer i am infinitely honored by this declaration  and i believe there are not many ladies    sir george why madam if the vanity may be excused i flatter myself there are not many ladies who would highly disapprove my addresses  i have more than once resisted some flattering overtures and from very fine women too  but my heart was reserved for miss dormer and she will make me the happiest man existing by kindly condescending to accept it   miss dormer i am very sensible how just a value should be placed upon such an affection as yours sir george and it gives me no little    sir george aside so the captain imagined i should not succeed with her   miss dormer you will pardon my confusion sir george  but the declaration i am going to make    sir george will demand my everlasting gratitude madam   miss dormer i shall be very happy to find you really of this opinion   sir george i must be eternally of this opinion condescension and benignity madam are animating every feature of that beautiful face and i am satisfied you will be prevailed upon not utterly to disregard the heart that so passionately solicits your acceptance   miss dormer indeed sir george i must own you are possessed of extraordinary merit   sir george this goodness is too much madam   miss dormer your understanding is enlarged   sir george dear miss dormer   miss dormer your person is unexceptionable   sir george you distress me madam by this excessive generosity   miss dormer your manners are amiable   sir george i want words to thank you madam   miss dormer and your humanity is unbounded   sir george what i am madam take me  i am yours and only yours nor should the united graces if prostrate at my feet and soliciting for pity rival you a moment in my affection  no miss dormer your happiness will ever be the ulimate object of my attention and i shall no longer wish to exist than while i am studious to promote it   miss dormer sir george i fear you misunderstand me  and yet it is in your power to make me very happy   sir george how can i misunderstand you my dearest creature if it is in my power to make you happy   miss dormer it is in your power indeed sir george   sir george bewitching loveliness how you transport me  so the captain thought i shoudnt succeed with her aside   miss dormer but if you would wish to see me happy  you must withdraw your addresses   sir george miss dormer   miss dormer it is impossible for me ever to return your affection   sir george miss dormer   miss dormer and i shall be miserable beyond belief by a continuance of your solicitation   sir george miss dormer   miss dormer o sir george to the greatness of your humanity let me appeal against the prepossession of your heart  you see before you a distressed young creature whose affection is already engaged  and who though she thinks herself highly honored by your sentiments is wholly unable to return them   sir george i am extremely sorry madam  to have been  i say madam  that  really i am so exceedingly disconcerted that i dont know what to say    miss dormer o sir george you have no occasion for apologies though i have unhappily too much  but i know the nicety of your honor and i depend upon it with security  let me then entreat an additional act of goodness at your hands which is absolutely necessary as well for my peace as for my fathers  this is to contrive such a method of withdrawing your addresses as will not expose me to his displeasure  let the discontinuance of them appear not to be the result of my request but the confequence of your own determination he is a zealous advocate for you and i should incur his severest resentment if he was to be acquainted with the real impediment to the match  you are distressed sir george and i am sinking with confusion  i shall therefore only add that i trust you with more than life and that i conjure you to compassionate my situation  by this conduct you will engage my eternal esteem and merit that happiness with a much more deserving woman which it is impossible for you ever to enjoy with me exit   sir george what is all this  a dream  no it is no dream and i feel myself awake but too sensibly  what then am i rejected despised where i supposed myself certain of success and approbation  this is too much  neither my pride nor my tenderness can support the indignity  and i shall  what shall i do shall i meanly betray the poor girl who has generously thrown herself upon my humanity and convince the world by such a conduct that she was right in refusing me  no damn it  i scorn a littleness of that nature and i must show myself worthy of her affection though her unfortunate preengagement would not suffer me to obtain it but how in the name of perplexity shall i manage the matter  a refusal on my side necessarily incurs the general resentment of the family and the censure of the world into the bargain  so that in all probability i shall not only have the honor of risquing my life but my reputation and this for the happiness of giving the woman i admire to the arms of my rival  really the prospect is a very comfortable one exit   enter miss montagu and miss dormer miss montagu upon my word caroline you have acted a very heroic part  but this unaccountable love is able to carry the most timid of the romantic ladies through the greatest difficulties  now had i been in your situation i could no more have asked the man to take my fault upon himself than i could have made downright love to him   miss dormer ah harriot you little know to what extremities a strong prepossession is capable of driving a woman even where there is the most evident impossibility of ever obtaining the object of her inclinations   miss montagu o my dear i see very plainly that it is capable of driving a woman to very great extremities   miss dormer well i am convinced that if any thing was to prevent your marriage with my brother you would notwithstanding this seeming insensibility look upon the rest of his sex with the utmost aversion   miss montagu i wonder caroline after my repeated declarations of indifference with regard to your brother that you can imagine i consider him with the smallest partiality  there was indeed a time when i might have been prevailed upon to endure the creature  but his negligence quickly alarmed my pride and prevented me from squandering a single sentiment of tenderness upon a man who seemed so little inclined to deserve it   miss dormer well my dear i am in hopes that you will have but little reason to blame his negligence for the future  because i know he intends this very day to solicit your approbation   miss montagu o he does me infinite honor and i suppose you imagine he is entitled to one of my best curtsies for so extraordinary an instance of his condescension  but caroline i am not altogether so critically situated as to be glad of a husband at any rate  nor have i such a meanness of disposition as to favor any addresses which are made to me with a visible reluctance   miss dormer a visible reluctance my dear    miss montagu yes caroline a visible reluctance  it is true indeed there are a good many kindhearted creatures who can stoop to fatter a fellows vanity even while he treats them with contempt  but i am made of different materials my dear  i love to mortify the presumption of those confident puppies who ask my hand with as much familiarity as if they asked a pinch of snuff and seem to say so child i want to make you the upper servant of my family   miss dormer you are a whimsical creature harriot  but how can you contrive to invalidate the contract between my brother and you if you are even serious in your determination   miss montagu if i can guess right your brother will himself find a very expeditious method of breaking it  however if he should not i am in no great hurry for a tyrant and my strephons impudent brow shall be pretty well loaded with wrinkles before he finds me in the humor of saying whenever you please good sir  and i am very much obliged to you   miss dormer well well jack must solicit for himself and i am sure notwithstanding this pretended want of feeling you are no way destitute of goodnature and sensibility   miss montagu goodnature and sensibility caroline  ay it is this goodnature and sensibility that makes the men so intolerably vain and renders us so frequently contemptible  if a fellow treats us with ever so much insolence he has only to burst into a passionate rant and tell a gross lie with a prodigious agitation  in proportion as he whines we become softened till at last bursting into tears we bid the sweet creature rise  tell him that our fortune is entirely at his service and beg that he will immediately assume the power of making us completely miserable   miss dormer what a picture   miss montagu while he scarcely able to stifle his laughter retires to divert his dissolute companions with our weakness and breaking into a yawn of insolent affectation cries poor fool she is doatingly fond of me  however caroline to convince you at once with regard to my sentiments for your brother    miss dormer well   miss montagu let me tell you now you have determined against sir george that this very coxcomb as you call him this narcissus who can love nothing but himself according to your account    miss dormer astonishment   miss montagu is the only man i shall ever think of seriously  there wonder  be amazed that i dont see with your eyes  and despise my want of taste  i am a mad girl you know and possibly like sir george for his peculiarities  but still foibles are less culpable than faults caroline and the vanities even of a coxcomb arc more ealsily cured than the vices of a libertine   enter a footman footman mr villars ladies sends his compliments and is ready if you are disengaged to play over the new air which you commended last night at the opera   miss dormer o well wait upon him instantly exit footman   miss montagu ludicrously o yes well wait upon him instantly   miss dormer how can you be so provoking harriot   miss montagu what provoking to wait upon your corydon instantly  come my sweet shepherdess let me show it to the parlour exeunt   the scene changes to willoughbys mrs willoughby enter mr willoughby is returned i find and has got the letter cornelia left for him  well by this time she is with her husband that is to be and will i suppose be speedily on her journey  the captain cannot recede now and let his father be pleated or displeased he is still heir to his title and fortune  what a difficulty i had to show her the necessity  pay the propriety of this measure  fond as she is of dormer it was hardly possible to engage her in it and she seemed at one time more determined to give him up for ever than betray the dignity of the female character  dignity indeed  i think i know what belongs to female dignity as well as most people  these very young girls however art strange creatures  their nicety is not in the least wounded when they tell a man they love him  but otis a deviation from dignity to own they wish him for a husband  here comes mr willoughby  he musnt know my share in this transaction till he finds himself happy in the good consequences and owns there is at least one sensible head in the family   enter willoughby speaking to a servant behind willoughby let a coach be called directly  she must certainly be gone off to this libertine dormer   mrs willougaby well have your elevated notions done you any service or has all turned out for the best now   willoughby madam madam dont distract me  dont distract me  i am sufficiently miserable without these unnecessary reproaches   mrs willoughby o you are i am heartily glad of it    willoughby yet something whispers at my heart that all will still turn out for the best    mrs willoughby indeed   willoughby yes  the dispensations of providence are always ways founded on justice  and none are ever sufferers in the end but those who have merited the utmost severity from its hands   mrs willoughby fine philosophy truly  and i suppose you would have thought it for the best if you had lost me as well as your daughter   willoughby ironically i would have tried at least madam to be as easy as possible under so great a misfortune   mrs willoughby you would you barbarous man  but you are miserable enough without such a circumstance and that is some comfort to me  your obstinacy has made your only child desperate and you have thought it better to run the hazard of her ruin than to establish her happiness on a certain foundation   willoughby i tell you madam any distress is preferable to the perpetration of a crime and there was no way of acting upon your principles without the blackest ingratitude to the common benefactor of my family  i feel for the indiscretion of this unhappy girl with the severest poignancy but i rejoice that my partiality for her led the father into no action that could impeach the probity of the man   mrs willoughby mighty fine   willoughby this madam is a consolation a great consolation in this hour of affection and let me tell you that in the severest trials the truly honest feel a satisfaction which is never experienced in the most flattering moments of a guilty prosperity   mrs wllloughby well well follow your own course and answer for the consequences  had my advice been taken  but who indeed takes sensible advice nowadays  you never took my advice in your life and you see what the effect has proved to your unfortunate family   willoughby a truce with your wisdom madam i beseech you for if it only teaches you to be worthless it would be happy for you to be the greatest idiot in the kingdom  but i have no time to waste in words every possible measure must be taken for the recovery of this infatuated girl    mrs willoughby and suppose you should not be able to recover this infatuated girl as you call her  what medicine will your philosophy in that case administer for so great a misfortune   willoughby the best of all medicines  the consciousness of having never deserved it exit   mrs willoughby why you illbred brute will not you take me along with you  i must go with him to see that every thing is conducted with propriety exit   the end of the second act act iii scene the park villars alone into how very hopeless a situation has my fortune at last plunged me and how unluckily has the very accident which i considered as the most happy circumstance of my life turned out a source of disappointment and distress  here while i was rejoicing on being entertained by sir john dormer was it possible for me to suppose that his amiable daughter would have made so absolute a conquest of my heart  but on the other hand was it possible to see so much sweetness affability and merit without the warmest admiration  yet to what purpose do i continually indulge myself in thinking of miss dormer  my lot in life is as precarious as it is poor whereas she is entitled to cherish the noblest expectations  it is true indeed captain dormer has favored me with his friendship and i am in hourly hope of an ensigncy by his means  and will an ensigncy  no  i will lock the secret eternally in my bosom and since i cannot raise myself up to the importance of her prospects she shall never be reduced to the penury of mine   enter dormer dormer all alive and merry my dear villars i am now in cash enough but here my boy is the commission i have been soliciting for you  l is just signed  and you must do me the additional favor of accepting this note to buy regimentals   villars you overwhelm me with this generosity    dormer nay no hesitating  you shall give me a draft upon the agent for the money or do any thing your ridiculous nicety requires so you only condescend to oblige me   villars i am at a loss for words to    dormer i am very glad of it as i dont want to be thanked for an act of common justice the necessities of the worthy have a constant claim upon the superfluities of the rich and we in reality only pay a debt where the world imagines we confer an obligation   villars this way of thinking is so noble that    dormer poh  poh  poh man let us have none of these elaborate acknowledgements especially at this time  when i have news for you  such news  would you believe it miss willoughby has actually left her father and is now at my private lodgings in pall mall   villars you astonish me   dormer read this letter and it will inform you of every thing   villars reads my dearest dormer my unrelenting father has this morning commanded me never to receive a visit from you more    dormer there is a touch of the pathetic villars  my unrelenting father has this morning commanded me never to receive a visit from you more ludicrously   villars but there is no possibility of existing without my dormer    dormer but there is no possibility of existing without my dormer   villars i have therefore sent some clothes and a few ornaments to the house in pall mall where i have occasionally met him and shall follow them immediately myself    dormer and shall follow them immediately myself  ay there she drops the heroic and sensibly proceeds to business   villars if my dormers passion is as sincere and as honorable as i think it he will take instant measures for carrying me to scotland    dormer no  scotland is too far to the north villars  too far to the north  but mind what follows   villars and put it out of the power of the most malignant destiny    dormer there she is in heroics again villars   villars to rob him or his cornelia willoughby   dormer to rob him of his cornelia willoughby  o you must speak that with all the emphasis of tragedy tenderness man  your voice must be broken  your bosom must be thumpd  your eyes must be fixed  zounds it will never do without a deal of the passionate   villars how can you turn a woman into ridicule whose partiality for yourself is the only cause of her indiscretion   dormer and how can you suppose that her partiality for me should render me blind to the impropriety of her conduct  i can see when a woman plays the fool with myself as soon as when she plays it with other people   villars well but what do you intend to do you see her elopement is upon an absolute supposition of your intending to marry her   dormer i dont know that nor do i see how i am bound to take more care of a ladys honor than she chooses to take herself  but even admitting the force of your supposition what can i do  it is not in my power to marry her she knows herself it is not in my power and i should cut a very ridiculous figure in the eye of the world if after a fine girl threw herself voluntarily into my arms with a perfect knowledge of my situation i was to read her a lecture of morality with a prim puritanical phyz and to cry you shall not stay with me miss you must go home and be dutiful to your papa   villars my dear captain a fond woman always judges of her lover by herself and miss willough by imagines because she is ready to run any risk for your sake that you will as readily run any hazard for here is  she therefore trusts you    dormer zounds villars how preposterously you argue  does not every woman who trusts entirely to the discretion of a lover  trust a robber with her purse and an enemy with her reputation a woman of real principle will never put it into a mans power to be persidious and i should not care to trust any of these eloping damsels with my honor who are such miserable guardians of their own   villars you are a very extrrordinary man indeed to think meanly of a woman for giving you the greatest proof which she can possibly show of her affection   dormer i must think meanly of any woman who gives me an improper proof of her affection though i may be inclined to take an advantage of it   villars indeed   dormer o villars if the women did but know how we dote upon them for keeping us at a sensible distance and how we despise them where they are forwardly fond their very pride would serve them in the room of reason and they would learn to be prudent even from the greatness of their vanity   villars so then you think miss willoughby fair game now she has    dormer undoubtedly  formerly indeed i had some scruples on her fathers account  but now she has gone this length there is no resisting the temptation  as i told you before villars she knows i cannot marry her she knows i am already engaged  and what the devil do you think she wants with me  hey   villars why but    dormer why but  why but what only consider man what a mind a woman must have who can plunge her whole family in wretchedness for any fellows sake honor believe me villars never took root in a bosom which is dead to the seelings of nature nor are those in the least to be pitied who are willingly destroyed   villars well well i stay still    dormer but well well  i havnt time to hear what you would say  for i want you to go to pallmall directly to see that miss willoughby is properly accommodated  i know the moment she is missed i shall be suspected so i will go to my fathers and be in the way there to save appearances as much as possible   villars why havnt you been at pall mall yourself to receive her   dormer yes but i had only time to take a few trifling liberties  and i am now going to make love very much against my inclination to miss montagu  my father read me a damned severe lecture this morning and the best way of preventing any suspicion from fastening on me about miss willoughby is to show every mark of readiness to comply with his inclinations  but go my dear boy about the business and i will do as much for you whenever a pretty woman brings you into difficulties   villars o i am much obliged to you   dormer the people of the house will admit you directly  and remember that a trifling lie or two must choke neither of us if any body should question us about the little runaway exeunt severally   scene changes to sir john dormers enter sir george sir george why how the plague shall i act in this affair  or with what face can i possibly tell sir john that i am desirous of declining an alliance with his family after i have so repeatedly solicited his influence with miss dormer  i promised to wait till he returned from the cocoatree  i wish he was come back with all my heart  for my present situation is none of the most agreeable  upon my word it was a mighty modest request of the young lady at the very moment she refused me to desire i would take the whole blame upon myself  your women of sentiment however have a very extraordinary manner of doing things  o but here comes sir john what the devil shall i say to him   sir john enter sir george i give you joy  joy a thousand times  i met caroline as i was coming up stairs and by her silence as well as blushing i read her readiness to comply with my wishes and find her the excellent girl i always imagined her   sir george she is a very excellent young lady indeed and i am very much obliged to her   sir john you cannot now conceive the transport of my heart at her cheerful concurrence but i hope you will one day experience that a dutiful child is the first of all human felicities   sir george it must be a very great happiness indeed sir john   sir john well sir george our lawyers shall meet this very evening and every thing shall be settled to our mutual satisfaction   sir george yes sir john i wish to settle every thing to your satisfaction   sir john there will be no great occasion for expensive preparations   sir george o none in the world none in the world   sir john i dont see any necessity you have to move out of our present house in berkeleysquare   sir george nor i either   sir john you have room enough there   sir george plenty   sir john why what is the matter sir george you speak with an air of coldness and embarrassment that surprises me   sir george sir john i am incapable of a duplicity   sir john well   sir george and notwithstanding my wishes for miss dormer are as ardent as she is deserving  a circumstance has happened which must forever deny me the blessing of her hand   sir john you astonish me  but what circumstance  she is ready    sir george yes yes she is very ready sir john   sir john then pray acquaint me with the impediment   sir george my dear sir john a point a very nice point of honor prevents the possibility of my indulging you in this request you may however safely assure yourself that i am now no less worthy of your good opinion than when you favored me with the warmest reeommendation to miss dormer   sir john mighty well sir george mighty well  and so you come into my house to solicit my influence in your favor over the affections of my daughter obtain her approbation and then without producing one cause for a change in your sentiments affront us both in the grossest manner by instantly receding from your engagements   sir george you are warm sir john   sir john have i not abundant cause for warmth when you deny a reason for the affront which on this occasion you have offered to my family  if you know any thing in my daughters conduct that renders her unworthy of your alliance pronounce it freely  and i shall myself be the first to approve your rejection of her  but sir george if you capriciously decline a treaty which you yourself took so much pains to commence without assigning a sufficient cause for your behavior be assured i will have ample satisfaction  nor shall the altar itself protect you from the united vengeance of an injured friend and an insulted father   sir george sir john i easily conceive the purport of this menace  but whatever measures you intend to take let me tell you i shall one day have your thanks for the conduct which now excites your indignation and let me also tell you that the very moment in which your hand is raised against my life will be the moment in which i shall prove myself the truest friend to your family   sir john away away you are all profession and falsehood  my daughter told me that you were incapable of loving any thing but yourself   sir george i thank her very heartily sir   sir john and that the wishes of your heart were entirely centred in the admiration of your own adorable person   sir george o i am infinitely obliged to her   sir john but insignificant as she justly represented you    sir george insignificant   sir john that insignificence shall not be your protection   sir george my protection mdashso i want to be protected   sir john therefore unless you would prove yourself as destitute of courage as of honor meet me at the cocoatree in an hour we can easily have a private room and if you fail i shall set such a stigma on the coward as will render him a scorn even to the greatest prosligate in the kingdom exit   sir george so  now i am engaged in a pretty piece of business  and must hazard my life for a woman who has not only rejected my addresses but mentioned me with contempt and danger joined to insult is my reward where in reality i ought to meet with thanks and approbation la la la la lalla  hums a french air  well be it as it will miss dormers secret shall be inviolably preserved  a thrust through the guts is to be sure disagreeable enough but if fellows every day hazard it in defense of the basest actions there can be no mighty heroism in running a little risque to support the cause of honor and generosity exit   scene dormers lodgings in pall mall enter miss willoughby miss willoughby where shall i hide my miserable head or how shall i avoid the stroke of impending destruction  the man who should have been the guardian is himself the person that attacks my honor and the unlimited confidence which i rashly reposed in his affection is now made use of to cover me with disgrace  o that my unhappy sex would learn a little prudence and be well convinced when they fly from the imaginary oppression of a father that they are seeking protection from the most cruel of all enemies those who mean to sacrifice their peace and blast their reputation   enter lucy lucy madam there is a gentleman from captain dormer come to wait upon you   miss willoughby what can he want with me   lucy i really cannot say madam  but if you please i will send him up and then you can know his business from himself   miss willoughby walking about in disorder how am i insulted and exposed but the woman deserves no respect from others who does not show a proper regard for her own character   lucy aside lord what a mighty fuss we make though i dont see we are a bit handsomer than other people  well madam what shall i say to the gentleman   miss willoughby show the gentleman up   lucy pertly yes madam exit   miss willoughby whoever he is he cannot increase my fears and may possibly bring me some intelligence to mitigate their severity   enter villars villars madam your most obedient  i wait upon you with captain dormers respects to apologize for his unavoidable absence a few hours and to hope that every thing here is quite to your satisfaction   miss willoughby as the captain sir has engaged your good offices on this occasion i suppose you are acquainted with the history of my indiscretion   villars the captain madam gave me no particular account of matters but only sent me as a friend on whose secresy he could rely to apologize for his absence and to enquire how you approved of this situation   miss willoughby with emotion sir i dont approve of this situation at all   villars i should be sorry madam that my presence distressed you   miss willoughby it is not your presence sir which distresses me it is the consciousness of my own folly it is the danger to which i have exposed myself  but sir your appearance is the appearance of humanity and i think you look with compassion on an unhappy young creature whom the perfidy of a man too tenderly esteemed has devoted to destruction if you do sir save me  i conjure you by all you hold most dear to save me from dishonor  i have been indiscreet but not criminal and the purity of my intention has some claim to pity though the rashness of my slight may be wholly without excuse   villars be composed madam  pray be composed  you affect me exceedingly  and you shall find a protector in me if you have any just cause to apprehend the least violence from captain dormer   miss willoughby if i have any cause sir  why instead of proceeding with me to a place where we might be securely united am i detained in this unaccountable house  why did he here attempt liberties that must be shocking to the mind of sensibility  and why at his departure did he give the people here orders to confine me to these apartments   viilars you feel too strongly madam   miss willoughby can i feel too strongly sir where my everlasting peace of mind is destroyed and where the man who declared he only existed for my sake is cruelly industrious to plunge me into infamy  unknowing in the ways of the world i could not distinguish between the language of sincerity and the voice of dissimulation  by my own integrity i judged of his truth and could not think that any man would be monster enough to return a tender partiality for himself with disgrace and destruction   villars madam there is something in your manner  there is something in this generous indignation that disposcs me very warmly to serve you and if you really desire to leave this house you shall leave it instantly the people have directions to obey me in every thing and i do not think myself obliged to answer mr dormers expectations where his demands are evidently contrary to the principles of virtue   miss willoughby sir you charm me with these sentiments   villars madam they are sentiments which should regulate the conduct of every man for he who suffers a bad action to be committed when he has the power of preventing it is in my opinion as guilty as the actual perpetrator of the crime   miss willoughby i am eternally indebted to this generosity sir   villars not in the least madam  for abstracted from my general abhorrence of what is indefensible i find i know not how an irresistible inclination to serve you  but we lose time  i will order a coach directly to the door and leave you at perfect liberty to follow your own inclinations   miss willoughby i have a fixed reliance on your honor sir and only lament that i have nothing but thanks to show my gratitude for this goodness   villars my dear madam your thanks are more than i deserve what i have done humanity made my duty and the most contemptible of mankind is he who declines the performance of a good action because he has not an expectation of being rewarded   end of the third act act iv scene sir john dormers enter dormer followed by willoughby willoughby captain dormer dont keep me on the rack but give me up my daughter   dormer sir i have repeatedly told you    willoughby yes sir you have repeatedly told me that you are wholly unconcerned in her flight  but this is the only thing in which i could find it any way difficult to believe you   dormer mr willoughby this doubt of my veracity is neither kind nor delicate   willoughby dont insult me captain dormer while you are loading me with calamity or possibly i may forget that you are the son of my benefactor  however sir i do not come here to menace but to supplicate  i do not come here to provoke the warmth of your temper but to interest the sensibility of your heart  you see me a distressed unfortunate miserable old man  the whole happiness of my life is wrapped up in the inconsiderate girl you have stolen from my arms  and if she is not instantly returned my portion will be distraction  restore her therefore i beseech you and restore her while she is innocent  the blow is a barbarous one which is aimed at the bosom of a friend and the triumph is despicable indeed which is purchased at the expcnce of humanity   dormer aside why how contemptible a rascal is a libertine   willoughby for pitys sake give me back my child nor destroy in your giddy pursuit of pleasure the eternal peace of a man who would readily risque his life for the advancement of your happiness  you have generosity captain dormer and you have underitanding  yet you combat the natural benevolence of your heart and oppose the evident sense of your own conviction you are cruel because it is gallant and you are licentious because it is fashionable  but sir let my distress my anguish restore you to yourself and teach you in some measure to anticipate the feelings of a father early in life an only son was taken from me and the evening of my days is now to be marked with the pollution of an only daughter  o mr dormer you men of pleasure know not how wide a ruin you spread in the progress of your unwarrantable inclinations  you do not recollect that besides the unhappy victim sacrificed there is a family to participate in her injuries a mother perhaps to die at her destruction and a wretch like me to madden at her disgrace   dormer i cannot be the rascal i intended aside sir  mr willoughby be satissied  miss willoughby is safe and well  nor shall i ever entertain a wish to disturb your happiness or to injure her reputation   willoughby eternal blessings on you for this generous declaration  but if you speak your real sentiments conduct me instantly to my child   dormer with pleasure sir  and i have great reason to imagine that the anxiety she has suffered in consequence of this little indiscretion will make her additionally worthy of your affection   willoughby why i always said that every thing happens for the best and that many accidents are really blessings in disguise which we lament as absolute misfortunes   dormer your philosophy will be justified in the present case i assure you   willoughby give me your hand captain  i esteem you more than ever  but come i am impatient to see my poor girl  her fault was the result of her inexperience and if we were all to be punished for the errors of indiscretion what would become of the best of us   dormer justly considered sir   willoughby come along come along man i want to be gone  and my miserable wife whom i didnt care to bring in for fear she should be clamorous waits for me in a coach at the end of the street   dormer i attend you sir  yet if half the gay fellows about town were informed of the business i am going upon  i fancy they would laugh at me pretty heartily   willoughby ah captain a man of sense should despise the ridicule of the profligate and recollect that the laughter of a thousand fools is by no means so cutting as the severity of his own detestation exeunt   scene changes to another apartment in sir john dormers enter miss montagu and miss willoughby miss willoughby thus my dear madam have i given you the whole history of my infatuation and i have now only to repeat my sincere concern for thinking it possible that captain dormer could be insensible of your very great merit and to entreat the favor of your interposition with my father   miss montagu my dear girl there is no occasion whatsoever for this generous apology   miss willoughby indeed madam there is  i was unpardonably vain in attempting to dispute a heart with you and i was extremely culpable in forgetting how much the completion of my own wishes might disturb the peace of a family to which my father had so many obligations   miss montagu my dear miss willoughby we women are all fools when we are in love and it is but natural that our own happiness should be more immediately the object of our attention than the happiness of other people  but i want to ask you a question about this recreant of ours to which i beg you will give me an ingenuous answer   miss willouhgby pray propose your question madam   miss montagu then my dear suppose matters could be so brought about that sir john would approve the captains attachment to you could you tell me heartily forgive the insolent use which he has just made of your generosity   miss willoughby dear miss montagu why do you ask me such a question   miss montagu because i am pretty sure you may still have him if you think him worth your acceptance   miss willoughby i really dont understand you   miss montagu you shall understand me then  i never will marry captain dormer   miss willoughby madam   miss montagu he is not a man to my taste   miss willoughby no   miss montagu no  he is worse to me to make use of an affected simile than prepared chicken gloves or almond paste   miss willoughby indeed   miss montagu yes  he is more offensive than naples dew or venitian cream the essence of daffodil or the imperial milk of roses   miss willoughby you cannot be serious surely  not like him   miss montagu no positively i do not like him   miss willoughby why where can there be so    miss montagu o bravo is he not more than painting can express or youthful poets fancy when they love    miss willoughby you reprove me very justly madam  and i blush to speak of a man with softness whom i should always consider with indignation   miss montagu come come my dear the captain is a very agreeable young fellow after all  but i know he is as indifferent about me as i can possibly be about him and i should never have a syllable of the tender kind from him  if he was not extremely unwilling to disoblige his father   miss willoughby has he yet declared himself madam   miss montagu why not expressly  but i expect him every moment to open with the usual formality and if you please we can not only render the scene a whimsical one but make him smart very sensibly for the liberties of this morning   miss willoughby in what manner pray   miss montagu why the moment he comes you shall retire into this closet  and in the midst of all his professions to me i shall take an opportunity of mentioning your name with an air of jealous resentment   miss willoughby well   miss montagu this i am sure will induce him to make violent protestations that this heavenly face of mine alone is the object of his adoration and as the men think it no way dishonorable to tell a trifling little fib to a woman i shall soon have him vowing everlasting fidelity and swearing the envious moon grows pale and sick with grief that i her maid am far more fair than she    miss willoughby i conceive the whole design madam   miss montagu well then when he is in the meridian of all his nonsense  do you steal softly out of the closet and sit in that chair  i will take care that he does not see you  if he forswears his passion for you give him a gentle pull by the sleeve  and looking him steadfastly in the face leave all the rest to accident   miss willoughby i am afraid i shall not have spirits to go through with it   miss montagu courage child havnt i given you spirits enough in declaring that i will never marry him  i think you said my woman let you in and that you saw nobody else   miss willoughby yes   miss montagu why then she shall keep your being here a secret from every body and i warrant well pay the captain off pretty handsomely  but why so melancholy   miss willoughby why my dear miss montagu i dont know if in justice to you i should think any more of dormer  he has so many accomplishments    miss montagu well my dear to make you entirely easy there is a man in the world who is in my opinion much more accomplished  but not a word to any body on this matter for your life  i only mention it to you in confidence and to show the probability of your yet being happy with dormer   enter jenny jenny madam the pens and paper are laid in the next room   miss montagu very well  go  and jenny    jenny madam   miss montagu dont give the least hint to any of the family that miss willoughby is here   jenny by no means madam exit   miss montagu and now well prepare a letter to your father  but come my dear girl you must not be so dejected  your little error is amply attoned for by the generosity of this conduct and there are some faults which like happy shades in a fine picture actually give a forcible effect to the amiable light of our characters exeunt   scene

truth is    mrs willoughby that is a good girl speak up   lucy the truth is i dont know where she is gone   dormer death and confusion  where can she be gone to   lucy that i dont know as i said before  but she went with your friend  the gentleman you sent here on a message to her exit   mrs willoughby o she is gone away with a friend of yours is she  for shame captain dormer  you a tender lover  you animated with that exquisite softness which souls of sensibility feel   dormer death madam why will you teaze me in this manner  i tell you i have been betrayed    reenter willoughby willoughby no sir it is i who am betrayed  and so a friend of his has carried her off  to mrs willoughby mrs willoughby yes and every thing happens for the best now  does not it   dormer mr willoughby  me   willoughby captain dormer after this reiterated insult this aggravated cruelty  it is infamous to talk with you  however sir old as you think me and little as you dread my resentment you shall feel it heavily  no injured as i am you shall never receive a stroke from me  i am too miserable myself by the loss of a child to stab my best benefactor even in the person of a worthless son  you are therefore afe  safe as the fears of cowardice can wish  but if you have feelings to those feelings i consign you  they will wake a scorpion in that bosom to avenge my wrongs  for know though bad men may find it possible to elude the justice of a whole universe they are yet utterly without means of flying from their own recollection   dormer mr willoughby let me only explain the matter    willoughby sir i will talk to no monsters   dormer dear mrs willoughby your husband is so impetuous    mrs willoughby dont speak to me sir  dont speak to me  a perfidious lover shall never gain an audience from mr willoughby  but my dear  what do you intend doing   willoughby pray madam dont teaze me   mrs willoughby why you il natured  but i will not forget the bounds of propriety  especially as you are not madman enough to fight  it would be little for the better if you were killed   willoughby death madam any thing would be for the better that set me free from your intolerable impertinence exit   mrs willoughby did the world ever hear such a vulgar fellow  but these husbands have no more breeding  and here he has gone without giving me his hand  in a little time i suppose the fair sex will be entirely neglected  going returns but sir a word in your ear  you are a base man  i would not violate propriety for the world  but you are a base man sir john shall know every thing instantly  t was i that urged my poor girl to repose that implicit confidence in your honor  and since my advice has lost  my assiduity will do any thing to recover her exit   dormer why how just is it that profligacy should be constantly attended with punishment and how reasonable is it that those who make no scruple of wounding the happiness of others should be conspicuously miserable themselves  how shall i look my father in the face when this matter comes to be known or how shall i see this unhappy old man whom i have so infamously wronged  what a poor what a paltry what a merciless passion is this passion of gallantry yet it reflects no scandal whatever upon it is followers though it begins in the most despicable falsehood and terminates in the most irreparable destruction  a man of gallantry is the only wretch who can despise the sense of shame and stifle the feelings of gratitude without reproach take him into your house he attempts the sanctity of your bed  load him with obligations and he betrays the purity of your daughter  the sensible world however allows him to be a man of honor all the time and he stabs you with impunity to the heart for presuming to complain of your wrongs  why did not i see the blackness of this character a little earlier  but  no  my cursed pride would resist the arguments of my conviction  and for a pitiful triumph over an unsuspecting innocent i must basely divest myself both of reason and humanity where can this girl be fled to  villars i am sure is incapable of betraying me and as she came here with her own consent she was prepared for the consequences of course   villars enter my dear villars you are come most luckily here miss willoughby is gone off and the people of the house have the impudence to say by your means   villars well and they say very justly   dormer how is this   villars i suffered her to escape  i assisted in her escape  and am now ready to answer for the consequences   dormer indeed   villars but first sir let me return you the commission and the note with which you were this morning so kind as to present me  i do not mean to keep your favors while i counteract your views and i scorn to profit by the generosity of any man unless upon terms that merit my approbation   dormer death and the devil sir how dare you use me in this manner how dare you betray my confidence so scandalously draw and give me instant satisfaction   villars i came here on purpose to give you satisfaction  but before i draw suffer me to ask a question or two in my turn  and now sir how dare you suppose that i was to be made the instrument of your licentiousness how dare you suppose that i would be the pander to your vices and join with you in a barbarous contrivance of destroying a young creature whose inexperience was her only crime   dormer here is a fellow   villars but i suppose you insulted me on account of my situation and imagined because i was poor that i was consequently worthless however sir be now undeceived and in the midst of your affluence and my poverty know that i am your superior for the best of all reasons because i disdain to commit a despicable action   dormer i am astonished at the very impudence of his rectitude and cannot say a syllable to him   villars when i came here instead of a willing victim to your wishes i found miss willougby in the utmost affliction conscious of her indscretion in flying from her father and shuddering with apprehension of violence from you  she soon informed me of her fears and lamented in the most pathetic terms how greatly she had been deceived in the object of her affection  she imagined an honorable union with you would have been the consequence of her flight and little supposed that the man she loved would make use of her partiality for himself to cover her with disgrace  thus disappointed thus betrayed she asked for my protection she received it  and now sir  drawing take your revenge   dormer yes sir i will take my revenge but it shall be thus  throwing down his sword and shaking villars by the hand thus my dear villars let me thank you for the superiority of your principles i am myself just awakened to a sense of true honor and cannot now i know the real motive of your conduct resent as an injury what i must look upon with the highest admiration   villars how agreeably you surprise me sir   dormer dear villars take these trifles again or i shall not think you forgive me  villars accepts the commission etc but my poor girl  and so she has principle after all  what a rascal have i been  do tell me where she is gone   villars indeed i cannot  i only saw her into a coach but i suppose she is returned to her fathers   dormer no  she is not  her father is but just gone  he came to me as i suspected on the very first knowledge of her flight and showed so deep a distress that i could not persevere in my design of seeming wholly ignorant of her elopement   villars well   dormer i therefore brought him here to give her back and the poor man was actually in ecstasies  but when he found she was gone he lost all patince and naturally enough imagining that she was carried off by my contrivance treated me with a freedom which nothing but the conviction of my guilt could enable me to endure even from the father of miss willoughby   villars upon my word this affair has drawn you into a very disagreeable situation   dormer into a disagreeable situation  into a damned one  and i shall hate the word gallantry as long as i live  my friends daughter too  shame  shame  shame  zounds villars a man ought to be good even from policy if he is not so from inclination  damn it you dont know half the perplexities of my situation   villars no   dormer no  distracted as i am i must assume a calm unruffled face immediately before miss montagu   villars what are you going to miss montagu directly   dormer yes instantly  i have myself requested a tete a tete to make a formal declaration  and truly i am in a pretty frame of mind to make love to a woman of her vivacity   villars why indeed your hands are pretty full of business   dormer yes yes i have business enough and my father will know every thing presently  but i must be a man of gallantry and be damned to me  villars you now see that the greatest of all idiots is he who makes himself despicable to destroy his own happiness exeunt   scene changes to a room at the cocoatree sir george alone well here i am and a pleasant affair i have to go through  i wish it was well over  for though there may be a great deal of bravery in venturing ones life i cannot say that there is a great deal of satisfaction   enter a waiter waiter sir john dormer sir   sir george show sir john up  now for it   the waiter returns introducing sir john and exits sir george sir john your most obedient   sir john well sir george i see you are a man of courage at least and so far i find you worth my resentment   sir george no reproaches now my dear sir john for the greatest enemies make a point of being perfectly well bred when they are going to cut one anothers throats   sir john then sir george that i may answer your ideas of politeness let me beg of you to draw instantly   sir george there is no refusing a request which is made with so much civility and now sir i am all obedience to your commands   sir john and now to punish the infamous insult which has been offered to my family   miss dormer rushes from a door at the head of the stage and falling upon her knees exclaims then punish it here sir for i alone am culpable   sir john how is this   miss dormer o sir hear me with pity for the dread of your resentment is insupportable   sir george a lady upon her knees pray madam suffer me raise you up   miss dormer no sir george this attitude best becomes a creature like me who has not only exposed her benefactor to danger but even raised a sword against the life of her father   sir john rise caroline  but tell me in the name of wonder what am i to understand by this   miss dormer my indiscretion sir  my disobedience  for though you have ever treated me with the most unbounded indulgence i have nevertheless ungratefully disappointed your views and placed my affection upon an object that can never be entitled to your approbation   sir george so my throat seems to be pretty safe this time   sir john go on   miss dormer actuated by my regard for this object though utterly despairing to obtain him i trusted sir george with the secret in the fullness of my heart and begged he would not only withdraw his addresses but withdraw them in such a manner as might save me even from the suspicion of any unwillingness to pay an implicit obedience to your commands   sir john this is very extraordinary   sir george yes but it is very true for all that   miss dormer sir george saw my distress and kindly complied with my request and had not i accidentally overheard the altercation which produced this meeting the best of fathers or the noblest of men  pointing to sir george had perhaps fallen a sacrifice to the unhappy prepossession of an inconsiderate daughter   sir george i never knew so sensible a woman in my life   miss dormer distracted at the extremity to which matters were carried i knew not how to act  the moment i was capable of resolving i resolved to fly here and wait for your arrival  not coming to any determination till you sir and sir george had quitted the house  here i hinted to the people my apprehension of a misunderstanding between you and desired to be placed in the next room to that which he told me was reserved for your use  the rest is already known  and i am now to entreat sir georges forgiveness for the danger to which his unexampled greatness of mind had so nearly exposed him  and to implore your pardon sir for daring to entertain even a hopeless prepossession when i knew it must combat with the favorite object of your inclinations   sir george come sir john  what the devil are you dreaming of  you and i are friends now  and therefore we need not stand altogether upon ceremonies   sir john i am considering sir george whether i ought most to be pleased or offended with my daughter   sir george zounds man be pleased with her for it will be most to your own satisfaction   sir john then caroline let me tell you that i am charmed with your frankness upon this occasion  though i am sorry it was not shown a little earlier  had you ingenuously told me the situation of your heart when i talked to you this morning you would have saved yourself much anxiety and prevented me from behaving in a manner to sir george that i must be eternally ashamed of   miss dormer indeed sir if you knew my motive    sir george come come my dear miss dormer  dont let us pain ourselves with the recollection of past anxieties  when we may indulge ourselves with the prospect of future happiness  i have no notion of the wisdom that makes us miserable  and therefore sir john must and shall if he expects me to overlook his cavalier conduct of today do me the favor to consult your inclinations   miss dormer you are too good sir george  but    sir john speak up my dear and tell us heartily who you have distinguished with your approbation  i am not one of the fathers who wish to maintain a despotic authority nor will i make my daughter wretched to convince the world that i am master in my family   sir george o fie sir john there are a great many good fathers who never refuse any thing but happiness to their children   miss dormer i am so overwhelmed with this goodness  it is at present too much for me as we go home in the coach i shall endeavor to let you know every thing  especially as the object of my choice is    sir john is he a man of merit my dear  is he a good man  he that is worthy in himself is above the despicable necessity of stealing a reputation from the virtue of his progenitors the riches of the heart are the noblest of all possessions   exeunt sir john and miss dormer sir george i am entirely of sir johns opinion  the riches of the heart are the noblest of all possessions and i dont think that on the present occasion i have proved myself the poorest fellow in the kingdom  notwithstanding my recent insignificance exit   end of the fourth act act v scene sir john dormer s house enter mis montagu and miss willoughby miss montagu why what can keep this hopeful corydon of ours   miss willoughby possibly some other attachment   miss montagu jealousy miss willoughby  rank jealousy my dear girl  o that we should be such fools as to bestow a single thought upon these wretched fellows who are not sensible of the obligation   jenny enter madam madam captain dormer is coming up exit   miss montagu to your ambush my dear  and be sure you watch a proper opportunity of annoying the enemy   miss willoughby retiring into a closet o you shall not have any occasion to question my generalship   enter dormer dormer miss montagu your most obedi ent   miss montagu captain dormer your most devoted humble servant   dormer i am come my dear miss montagu    miss montagu i see you are my dear captain dormer   dormer the amiable vivacity of your temper madam has always been an object of my admiration  but i come now to solicit you in regard to a subject    miss montagu upon which it is criminal i suppose to exercise my amiable vivacity   dormer i need not inform you madam of the engagement which so happily for me subsists between our families  nor need i remind you    miss montagu why then do you give yourself this trouble sir if the information is so very unnecessary   dormer that i may tell you madam i am inexpressibly fortunate in the honor of this interview and that i may assure the most charming of her sex the whole felicity of my life materially depends upon her approbation   miss montagu upon my word a very pretty speech captain and very tolerably expressed  but do you know now that i look upon the whole business of making love to be mighty foolish and have no notion of a womans sense who is to be flattered out of her liberty by a flimsy compliment to her person   dormer this liveliness is charming  but you must not however rally me out of my purpose  suffer me therefore my dear miss montagu to implore    miss montagu now positively i must stop you for there is no bearing the insolence of this humility   dormer what insolence  my dear miss montague  is it insolence thus to fall at your feet  is it insolence    miss montagu for heavens sake dormer dont make a fool of yourself  for i tell you the humblest supplications with which you men can possibly teaze the women are an unaccountable mixture of pride and absurdity   dormer there is something so very new in this opinion madam that i should be glad you would let me know how it is to be supported   miss montagu otis very easily supported if you only suffer me to put the general purport of all love addresses from the time of the first pair down to the present hour into something like plain english   dormer pray do   miss montagu why then suppose that a tender lover like you should offer up his adoration at the altar of some terrestrial divinity like myself let me ask you if this would not be the meaning of his pretty harangue however he might study to disguise his design with the plausible language of adulation   dormer now for it   miss montagu dont interrupt me  madam your beauty is so exquisite and your merit is so transcendent that emperors themselves might justly tremble to approach you and languish in the deepest despair of being allied to so much perfection   dormer well said   miss montagu yet though all hearts are yours and though you were born to triumph over an admiring world i desire you will instantly appoint me the master of your fate  my happiness depends upon your being a slave and i must be eternally wretched without the power of making you miserable  you must therefore promise to know no will but my humor and no pleasure but my inclination  your present state of freedom you must exchange for the most mortifying dependence and throw your whole fortune at my feet for the honor of managing the domestic concerns of my family if you    dormer what the devil is there more of it   miss montagu if you behave well that is if you put up with every caprice of my temper and every irregularity of my conduct if you meanly kiss the hand that strikes at your repose and treat me with reverence when i offer you the grossest indignities you shall have an occasional new gown and sometimes the use of your own chariot  nay if you are very good indeed i may carry my kindness still farther and use you with nearly as much civility as any of my servants   dormer what havnt you done yet   miss montagu o i could go on for an hour  but what do you think of this specimen  is not it a true translation of all the love speeches that have been made since the commencement of the world and arent you men a set of very modest creatures to suppose that an address of this elegant nature is calculated to make an instant conquest of our affections   dormer this spirit is bewitching and increases my admiration though it treats me with severity   miss montagu well notwithstanding the frightful idea which i entertain of matrimony i am nevertheless half afraid i shall be at last cheated out of my freedom as well as the rest or my sex  but then i must be perfectly convinced of my admirers sincerity   dormer a decent hint that though i wish it had been spared  aside and can you my dear miss montagu possibly doubt the sincerity of my professions and cruelly turn away those irresistible eyes when i vow an everlasting fidelity  what still silent my angel  not a word  not one word to rescue me from destraction  but be it so  if miss montagu decrees my fate i submit without murmuring for death itself is insinitely preferrable to the idea of offending her going i think i am pretty safe now aside   miss montagu now who would believe that this fellow could lie with so very grave a countenance aside why you are in a violent hurry captain dormer   dormer o zounds she calls me back does she aside what my dear miss montagu do you relent do you feel the least compassion for the distresses of a heart that adores you   miss montagu sit down captain  sit down here  i am a strange foolish creature  and cannot disguise my sentiments  but if i thought myself the only object    dormer by all my hopes    miss montagu well dont swear  i must believe you  and yet i am strangely apprehensive that in the extensive circle of your acquaintance you must have formed some attachments  the world has been talking  and it is no secret that miss willoughby has accomplishments   miss willoughby enters unobserved by dormer and sits down dormer yes madam  miss willoughby has accomplishments but they are very trifling   miss montagu then you never entertained any tenderness for her i suppose   dormer for miss willoughby madam  o my dear miss montagu you dont think me altogether destitute of understanding   miss montagu why you just now owned that she had accomplishments   dormer yes i said that she had trifling ones   miss montagu and no more   dormer the babys face is regular enough  and might serve very well for the window of a toyshop   miss montagu then i find there is nothing to be apprehended on her account   dormer on her account my angel you shall not lessen the merit of your own attractions so much as to admit the possibility of supposing it   miss willoughby giving him a pull by the sleeve i am very much obliged to you sir   miss montagu ludicrously not a word not one word to rescue me from distraction    miss willoughby the babys face is regular enough and might serve very well for the window of a toyshop    miss montagu but be it so  if miss montagu decrees my fate i submit without murmuring    miss willoughby o dont think the gentleman altogether destitute of understanding    miss montagu for death itself is infinitely more preferrable to the idea of offending her  there miss willoughby is a man of honor for you    miss willoughby and are these the men who value themselves so much upon their veracity   miss montague o my dear they have veracity to a very prudent degree for they never tell a falsehood to any body who is capable of calling them to an account  but come miss willoughby let us leave the gentleman to himself  he has a very pretty subject for a reverie and it would be cruel to disturb him in his agreeable reflections  sir your most obedient  give it him home my dear girl  have no mercy on him  aside to miss willoughby   miss willoughby sir your most respectful    miss montagu that is right  sir your most obliged    miss willoughby your most faithful    miss montagu bravo  and most devoted humble servant exeunt laughing   dormer after a long pause of confusion so i have had a hopeful time on it  my evil genius has been along arrear in my debt and now pays me off with a witness  what a sneaking what a pitiful puppy do i appear  thus detected and thus laughed at  but i deserve it all  i woudnt see the infamy of practicing deceit upon a woman  i must even think myself called upon to betray because the object was a woman and laugh at the anguish i gave a worthy heart because it was lodged in a female breast   notwithstanding all my mortification however i am overjoyed at finding miss willoughby safe  i may now perhaps prevent the matter from reaching my fathers ears  not that i fear he will discard  but what is insinitely worse if he knows it will eternally despise me  how merry the girls were with me  sir your most respectful  sir your most obliged  sir your most faithful    enter sir john sir john sir your most devoted humble servant    dormer aside o now i am completely done for    sir john well sir what can be urged for you now  is this the reformation i was to expect  and is this the regard which you entertain for the credit of your family   dormer if you will give me leave to clear this matter up sir    sir john it is already cleared up  mr willoughby  miss montagu have cleared it up  and now suppose mr willoughby listening only to the dictates of his rage and not to the pleadings of his friendship for me had demanded reparation for his wrongs how after robbing him of his daughter could you come prepared against his life  and how after destroying a young ladys reputation could you attempt to embrue your hands in the blood of her father  but sir you are a man of spirit you are a man of honor and that spirit and that honor are to be sufficient pleas for every violence offered to justice and every outrage committed upon humanity  you have a title to be guilty because you have the character of being brave and you may perpetrate the blackest crime with impunity because you have the diabolical resolution to defend it   dormer there is so much propriety in this reproach sir  that i feel myself unable to answer it    sir john that sword i gave you sir to be exerted in the cause of honor not to be drawn in the support of infamy  i gave it to be used in the defense of your country not to be exercised in the violation of her laws  but why do i talk of honor to him who looks with admiration upon shame and thinks himself accomplished in proportion as he becomes profligate  why do i reason with a man who glories in the prostitution of his understanding and imagines he exalts his character as he destroys the peace of society  perhaps in his ideas of bravery he may be obliged even to raise his arm against my bosom and perhaps he may punish a reproachful mention of his vices though it comes from the lips of his father   dormer sir i have been culpable  extremely culpable  but my present intention is to remove mr willoughbys distress  not to defend the injury i offered him  and i can with truth affirm that the principal part of my misconduct in this affair originally proceeded from the great veneration which i entertained for that very father who now thinks me so profligate and unnatural   sir john mighty well   dormer i loved miss willoughby sir tenderly loved her before you entered into any engagement about miss montagu  but fearful of disobliging you i kept the circumstance of my passion a secret as i did not suppose you would countenance a union where there was so material a disparity of situations   sir john and pray sir how dare you suppose that i should be more offended at the performance of a good action  than at the commission of a dishonorable one  how dare you imagine i should be displeased at your marriage with miss willoughby and that i should not be infinitely more displeased at this scandalous seduction  but it was your regard for me which led you to betray the confidence of your friend as well as to attempt the innocence of his daughter  yes sir your regard for me is extremely evident  you knew how much my happiness depended upon your reputable rise in the world and how warmly i expected you would be a credit to your country as well as an ornament to your family  your natural advantages were great and your education has been liberal  yet instead of the slattering prospects with which my imagination was once delighted i have now nothing before me but a gloomy scene of disappointment and regret  instead of hearing my sons name with joy and exulting in the growing dignity of his character i am hourly mortified with some fresh accounts of his licentiousness and hourly trembling left the hand of wellgrounded resentment or the sword of public justice should cut him off in the perpetration of his crimes  instead of finding him the support of my age he incessantly saps the foundation of my life and instead of kindly nourishing the lamp of my existence with his virtues he sinks me down into the grave an equal victim of sorrow and disgrace   dormer falling at his fathers feet no more sir i beseech you no more  nor suppose me such a monster  my life hitherto has been a scene of folly and dissipation and i reflect with the deepest concern upon the anxiety which the best of fathers has suffered on my account  but if he can be prevailed upon to forgive the past the future i will boldly say shall merit his approbation  for i am now satisfied that nothing can be consistent with the principles of honor which is any way repugnant to the laws of morality   sir john rise and be my son again  there is a candor there is a generosity in this acknowledgment which engages my confidence and i still slatter myself with a belief that you will answer my warmest expectations   dormer you are too good sir  but the freedom with which i shall communicate the most unfavourable circumstances of this affair as well as my readiness to fulfill all your commands shall in some measure prove the certainty of my reformation   sir john why jack this is speaking like my son  and to let you see that your inclination is the only object of my wishes miss willoughbys hand now waits to crown your return to virtue   dormer miss willoughbys sir   sir john yes  miss montagu just as i entered acquainted me with the whimsical distress of your courtship scene in terms equally consistent with her usual goodnature and vivacity and on account of your attachment to miss willoughby as well as her own fixed disinclination to be yours requested i would not think any longer of the treaty between our families  finding her determined in the solicitation i would by no means force her wishes  and am now rejoiced at so lucky an opportunity of rewarding as you yourself could desire the merit of your present character   dormer there is no doing justice to the generosity of your sentiments sir    sir john poh poh man the parent that makes his children happiest always gives them the best fortunes  well now join the company cheerfully  but remember for the future my dear boy what every son should constantly have in view that more than your own happiness and your own honor are trusted to your care and that you cannot experience a misfortune nor suffer a disgrace without sensibly wounding the bosom of your father exeunt   scene another room at sir john dormers sir george enter so then it seems i am not quite detestible after all  it seems there are some women though i have been rejected who can still think me amiable  and declare if ever they change their situation i must positively be the man  villars had the secret from miss dormer  and miss dormer had the acknowledgement of miss montagus regard for me from miss montague herself  her refusal of dormer moreover over corroborates the intelligence even if there was any thing very improbable in my having engaged a ladys affection  upon my soul i dont see but harriot is to the full as handsome as caroline and then her understanding  yes i think it is pretty evident that she has the advantage in understanding  ay but can i so readily forget caroline  can i so quickly remove my addresses and offer up that heart at the shrine of the one which has been so recently rejected at the altar of the other  why to be sure there will be nothing extremely gallant in such an affair  but at the same time there will be nothing extremely preposterous  it does not follow because i have been repulsed by one woman that i should forswear the whole sex and in a fit of amorous lunacy like the knight errants of old nobly dedicate my life to despair because i unfortunately lost the original object of my affections  besides at the present period changing hands is all the fashion and while it is so meritorious in men of quality to part with their wives it cannot surely be very criminal to part with our mistresses  here by all that is opportune she comes  what a bewitching girl  o twoud be barbarous to let her pine  i will give her encouragement at once and put an end to her anxiety   enter miss montagu miss montagu o there is no bearing their loves and their joys  their tears and their congratulations  sir john has joined the hands of another couple  and caroline has now miss willoughby to keep her in countenance  but pray sir george was not poor villars overjoyed when you told him of sir johns design of receiving him as a soninlaw   sir george he was both with gratitude and astonishment  however i carried him immediately to sir john here miss dormer was sent for and without the least hint of her private sentiments sir john who had properly sounded the young fellows inclinations introduced him as a man whom he found worthy to be his soninlaw and her husband   miss montagu i pitied her situation most heartily   sir george i pity the situation of every lady in love madam   miss montagu i am sure miss dormer thinks herself much indebted to your generosity   sir george perhaps madam i may yet have obligations to the prepossession of miss dormer   miss montagu prepossessions are strong things sir george   sir george and in a ladys bosom madam very troublesome   miss montagu not where the object is attainable    sir george true madam  and he must be a barbarian who conscious of a ladys tenderness possesses the ability without the inclination to return it  i think that hint will give her some consolation aside   miss montagu the men i believe sir george have but few opportunities of exercising such a barbarity  indications of tenderness seldom first proceed from the ladies   sir george i dont know that madam  but was i happy enough to be the object of a ladys esteem  i would sacrafice much to remove her anxiety  this will make her speak or the devils in it aside   miss montagu kind creature and so you would condescend to take pity on her   sir george i would do every thing to make her happy madam  why what the plague must she be in love and is the courtship to come entirely from my side aside   miss montagu well you are a whimsical creature and so i leave you    sir george stay miss montagu    miss montagu for what   sir george i will be generous and spare her blushes aside i have something very serious to say to you   miss montagu serious indeed if one may judge by your gravity   sir george miss montagu i am inexpressibly concerned  i say inexpressibly concerned to see you of late so melancholy   miss montagu to see me of late so melancholy  why sir george i never had better spirits   sir george no   miss montagu no  really    sir george i could not imagine it   miss montagu and why so pray   sir george why so madam nay i have no particular reason  but miss montagu i should be sorry to see you labor under the smallest uneasiness  i have the highest opinion of your merit madam  and    miss montagu surely caroline has not  aside i shall be always proud of possessing a place in the good opinion of sir george hastings   sir george you do possess the principal place in my good opinion madam  and    the back scene thrown open discovers sir john captain and miss dormer villars mr mrs and miss willoughby sir george zounds this interruption is abominable   dormer ay this is right now the rooms are thrown together we shall have space enough for a country dance in the evening  villars we now are bothers   villars to my unspeakable transport   sir john to willoughby who seems in private conversation with him nay no acknowledgment my dear mr willoughby  i am acting no more than an interested part and consulting my own wishes in the wishes of my children   willoughby to his wife does not every thing happen for the best now  and is not this excellent young man to whom i probably owe my child another proof that if we are desirous of happiness we must labor to deserve it   mrs willoughby aside my scotch scheme has helped the business greatly for all that   sir john well have a public wedding  the friends of all our families shall be invited  and mr villars let not any humility in the situation of yours prevent you from calling the worthy to be witnesses of the justice which fortune renders to your merit   villars sir your goodness is unbounded  but justice obliges me to tell you that the man thus honored with your esteem is even more humble than you think him that he has no family no relations  and out of this company no friends   willoughby how is this   sir john pray was not mr villars the clergyman in my neighborhood your uncle   villars he was the best of men and more than a father to me in every thing but the actual relation   willoughby impatiently stand out of the way    mrs willoughby my dear i desire you will not forget the rules of propriety   willoughby you said sir you were ignorant of your family   villars i did sir   willoughby some unhappy father like me now bleeds for the loss of a son  pray go on    mrs willoughby my dear    villars at an early stage of infancy some wandering miscreants stole me from my friends and carried me into a distant part of the country where a woman who called herself my mother being committed to prison for a theft fell ill of a fever that put a period to her life  with her dying breath she related this circumstance and would have told more but the last agonies taking away her utterance prevented the possibility of any farther declaration   sir john how unfortunate   miss dormer how extremely unfortunate   villars it would have been still more unfortunate had not the good mr villars who kept a little academy in the place attended the poor wretch with medicines and looked with an eye of compassion on my helpless situation  mr villars was the universal friend of mankind the rich never mentioned him without reverence and the poor never beheld him without joy  but his income was too narrow for the extent of his benevolence and he was involved in continual distresses from the uncommon excellence of his heart   sir george zounds no person doubts his being a good man   villars mr villars without hesitating ordered me to be taken care of and as soon as i was capable of instruction received me into his house where i was educated in common with the rest of his pupils  and at last grew sufficiently qualified to be his assistant but his necessities increasing with the exercise of his virtues notwithstanding my utmost assiduity he was obliged to sell his academy and i had at last the mortification of closing his eyes in the very prison from which i was originally rescued by the greatness of his humanity   miss dormer and was it just at this time that sir john bought the seat in your neighborhood   villars it was madam  and it was at this time also that hearing sir john had an occasion for an assistant in some literary employments i procured the recommendation to him which has given me the honor of being known in this family  the only trace of what i ever was is this picture which was by some means in my possession when i was stolen as the woman who stole me declared in the course of her imperfect narration fearing to dispose of it she kept it to the hour of her death and then delivered it up as a possible means of finding out my family    sir john let me see this picture   willoughby no let me see it for the love of heaven  o sir john  sir john  this was lady dormers picture  she made a present of it to my first wife and here on the setting are the initials of her name   sir john i remember it perfectly  i myself ordered the letters to be engraved   villars i can scarce speak   willoughby while i have power to ask  tell me sir what is your age   villars twentytwo   willoughby receive my thanks receive my thanks kind heaven  o my boy my boy providence still orders all things for the best and i am in reality your father   villars o sir bless your son and assure him he has a father   miss willoughby embracing him my brother my deliverer too  this is happiness indeed    mrs willoughby let me embrace you too  your sister will tell you what a motherinlaw i am and how much she is indebted to my lessons of propriety well i begin myself to think every thing happens for the best after the unexpected good fortune of this morning   dormer not to sir george i am sure  for he loses a good estate by this unexpected discovery here miss montagu miss dormer sir john and dormer seem congratulating villars  so does sir george   sir george what you begin to crow again do you  but let me tell you i think every accident happens for the best which enables me to do an act of justice and advance the welfare of the deserving   miss montagu generously considered indeed sir george  few people i believe would give up a fortune so easily   sir george why my friend jack there if he lost both an estate and a mistress in a couple of hours would hardly set so good a face upon matters notwithstanding he is much my superior in serenity of countenance   sir john and perhaps sir george even you may be a considerable gainer in the end if we can but contrive to make an actual comedy of todays adventures by your marriage with a certain lady in this company looking at miss montagu   sir george and possibly that might be yet effected through your interposition sir john with miss montagu   miss montagu what is your denouement to be produced at my expense upon my word i should be much obliged to sir johns interposition for such a purpose   sir george i should at least madam  and though i come rather with an ill grace after so recent a rejection    dormer your affection is not unadulterated now george   sir george why no  but i havnt yet told miss montagu  that death itself is infinitely preferable to the idea of offending her  ludicrously though i would readily risk my life to purchase her favorable opinion turning to her   miss montagu well dont talk to me on this subject now sir george  you have to be sure merited much  and you are in every respect so greatly the opposite of my confident swain there who thought i must fly into his arms the moment he condescended to receive me  that  however i will not hear a syllable from you now  if you can make a tolerable bow to me do but dont let me hear a syllable of nonsense i
