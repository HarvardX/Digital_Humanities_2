a sequel to common sense or the american controversy considered in two points of view hitherto unnoticed  first  that parliaments cannot be supreme in all cases whatsoever without being infallible also  second  that colonies when they find themselves competent that is come of age may in consequence of an unanimity nay a majority of voices throw off all subjection to the originating parent state a power derived from god and authorized by the necessity of things  by theophilus philadelphus  inutiles amputans feliciores inserit  the second edition corrected and enlarged  dublin printed by alex stuart in st audeonsarch mdcclxxvii  preface were despotisms life not short as vile biographys chaste pages to defile existence were a curse from gods right hand and everlasting justice at a stand  the freedom of the press is our glory and palladium it is indeed our national breath of existence as a free independent state it is the heart of the bodypolitic through which constitutional life circulates freely and vigorously giving strength exertion and activity to every member when it is obstructed partially or totally destroyed disease or death inevitable ensues all nations in proportion as they enjoy a freepress enjoy the inestimable blessings of personal liberty and proprietary possession some have it perfect and unlimited for instance britain and british america britain and america are therefore perfectly and without limitation a free people some in a qualified and discretionary degree like france whose subjects accordingly taste the exquisite delights of freedom just as the ruling powers are disposed from a wellconditioned though evervarying sense of right and justice to fix the precise point of discretion and qualification others again in the most absolute terms of despotic prohibition of which the pontifical states are an example rome and italy of course are at this present time in the most deplorable state of stupefied ignorance and browfallen subjection a state infinitely worse than if they had not existed as a people at all  from this short representation it is plain that no people now upon earth are possessed of freedom in any sense worthy of men and christians but britons in which term i would comprehend great britain and ireland america and all their widely spread dependancies now alas in a violent convulsive state of being torn and rent asunder by the councils and machinations of wicked and abandoned men  wonderful and dishonorable tale that nine parts of ten of our habitable globe should have passively and patiently worn away the progressive series of more than fifty centuries only to become the very reverse of what god the creator intended man to be the contemplation of this subject plunges the human mind into a fathomless reverie from which it never emerges without that irresistible influx of strong sensibilities the effect of which is always pain and debasement beyond the picturation of words especially is the reflective philosophical soul wounded in its feelings when it is considered that so enormous a disproportion of our species all along suffered themselves to be sunk into so wretched and brutal a state for the sake of a few individuals i mean kings who in the grasp of the people had the people retained any portion of the divinity among them would have been no more than the crush of a midge under an elephants foot  a sort of twofold consideration tends to deepen and inveterate this wound  kings for being such far less to become tyrants had no original natural right whatever no right in short exclusive of the free election of the people but what the barbarian the ruffian the robber and the murderer may assume this matter is set in a clear uncontrovertible light in consequence of knowing the will and appointment of heaven the will and appointment of heaven we that are christians and what is more protestants with the new testament in our hands know perfectly let it be premised that what latterly has been found the moral intentions of god respecting the grand line of conduct among nations and individuals was always the moral intentions of god though not promulgated neither is the justice of god impeachable here for not promulgating them sooner by express revelation because the universal or endemic disease did not sooner arrive at its crisis to be cured and because in reality such a promulgation actually took place at the creation of man under the vigorous effect of which it is well known that for many successive ages after our race had been created the patriarchal state of equality or the shepherd erratic state subsisted and flourished without any subordination but what spontaneously and in the course of things resulted from parental seniority venerable gravity piety wisdom and experience  true matters altered for the worse very soon bad dispositions discovered themselves bad habits were contracted envy avarice jealousy and ambition seized on the human mind as a sort of prey virtuous unsuspicious equality ceased and government with its appending evils and proneness to degenerate began the first promulgated moral intentions of heaven were consequently superceded declining gradually till at length they became totally forgotten and absorpt in the abandoned vices and idolatry of the heathen world  but this brings not the moral law first imprinted on the heart of man into dispute for the same objection lies against revelation itself which in its spirit and legislative government of the christian world has been as much abused corrupted neglected and set aside as the primary law of nature the creational standard of conduct ever was by the heathen world  having i hope pretty clearly evinced this point the will and appointment of heaven with regard to the present circumstances of nations remains to be ascertained  in times posterior to the great christian lawgiver our test and proof must be taken from the scriptures undoubtedly christs little kingdom at first consisted of himself and his twelve apostles dictating in this kingdom which will one day be supreme over all this is his explicit command as conveying the will and appointment of heaven throughout all generations the princes of the gentiles heathens pagans exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant now the point of discussion here is whether this remarkable precept so clearly expressed be a general or a partial one that is comprehensive of kings rulers and governors or barely restricted to individuals in obscure social life or to give it another face still whether emperors and kings are not as strictly and minutely bound down to the performance of all the christian virtues of which mercy placability forbearance justice equity truth selfdenial and universal benevolence are the principal as the meanest of those that are styled their subjects who dare affirm they are not i dare affirm however novel and unpopular the affirmation they are to admit the contrary involves conclusions ruinous to the peace welfare and happiness of society if kings and magistrates are not included in the christian code of moral precepts or have an indemnification peculiar to their order for transgressing them then are tyranny and oppression the ravages of countries and devastations of kingdoms carried forward and needs must be carried forward through all future ages under the auspices and protection of heaven an alexander a nero a charles xii a lewis xiv not to mention any more of the butchers and plunderers of the world would have felt themselves perfectly beatified in the thought  but the argument need not be extended god knows no artificial complex bodies such bodies can have no identity or responsibility in the aggregate in another world a king will be judged not as a king but as a man his kingly acts were not appointed by god but his acts as a man are on the contrary the express appointment of god and are indispensable state necessity the arcana imperii or the accommodable municipal law of nations will not bring kings off any more than a critical urgent train of circumstances into the embarrassment of which he has voluntarily brought himself will excuse an individual guilty of violence robbery or blood the law of nations and the secrets and policy of states are the institutions of mere men acting as their own lawgivers without precept or injunction from heaven therefore can avail nothing as a justification in instances where a superior law has been broken and trodden under foot  this is clearly the state of things on the great christian scale of required duty so that modern kings have but one alternative in the midst of their astonishing artificial greatness either to deny they are christians throw off the appellative altogether or confess that the same simple pure unaffected disinterested morality in all cases whatsoever is as much required from them and those they depute in authority under them as from the very lowest of the people those they proudly call their subjects and vassals nor can a king with any prospect of being heard retire to his closet to ask god forgiveness for his sins if he has by the medium of his fleets and armies shed the blood of one man or taken his property from him wrongfully not to mention the blood of thousands perhaps lying at his door whose ghosts are now soliciting restitution from and vengeance upon him in the invisible world  very true he cannot be called to account in this life except by another king happily as flagitious bloodyminded and inexorable as himself while in the mean time he is surrounded and kept in countenance by his generals and soldiers his courtiers and clergy what then these with himself shall in the natural course of things be reduced to that dust they now tread upon as insignificant in memory as the monarchs and ministers of state before the flood  a higher authority than any kings has said requite not evil but rather return evil for good this is addressed to sovereigns as well as to beggars nor have i the smallest doubt that should a kings duty as a man and a christian essentially interfere with his duty as a king or an elected head of a community that he should unquestionly prefer the first to the last and should it even come to that grand decisive declaratory point by which he must either cease to be king or wound his own conscience by disobeying god however importunate the fastidious and selfcreated exigencies of a court might be that should impel him to act contrarily he ought undoubtedly to resign his scepter and his crown for the same reason that a minister under him should give up his commission and emoluments annexed when any thing has been officially injoined him inconsistent with his honor virtue and integrity  i believe not one instance of the former has occurred in the annals of our world and of the latter comparatively very few but the paucity in either case establishes no precedent the superior exertions of disinterested greatness and heroic excellence though seldom very seldom occurring to ennoble our nature are notwithstanding still within the requisitions of christianity  the destruction of freedom in so many christian kingdoms i may say in all except great britain the natural birthright of men and in the defense of which taking the life of another is no crime by princes and kings is an accumulation of guilt upon their head which they may support for a few years by means of adventitious aids but which must assuredly overwhelm them when they stand common naked spirits in another world the extinction of freedom is the extinction of every noble manly generous virtue as well as christian grace all tyrants therefore have this additional guilt lying heavy on their souls however insensible they are of it to deface the image of god in millions and from day to day prevent them from recovering it is an enormity of the first magnitude but it wants a name multitudes of nefarious execrable deeds in the primary movements of every state according as it is more or less tyrannical have no appropriate terms in our dictionaries they are too black and horrid and too industriously hid behind tartarian veils from the inspection of the people to be admitted into the language of humanity but of all the deeds of darkness and insolent outrage on the privileges of mankind to destroy the liberty of the press is surely the most diabolical it is laying an embargo on the human mind saying to its divine faculties hitherto shall ye come and no farther the same spirit were it competent to the act would lay an embargo on the sun and say to the heavenly brightener of our habitations hitherto shall thou come proud luminary and here shall thy proud beams be staid nay the very air we breathe in sweet and pure diffusion could the same spirit stop or confine its circulation it malignantly would  the fact however is this what is just right and fit in england is just right and fit in france germany turkey and in all the kingdoms of the earth nations may be called great individuals under the eye of natures sovereign lord subject to eternal laws superior to themselves which they may not on any pretense whatsoever relax accommodate or explain away to serve their own partial local circumstances were such a preeminent immutable law supposed not to exist let the intelligent reader mark the consequences every nation must be considered as absolutely supreme and infallible in itself not with reference to man only but with reference to god the creator of man this absurdity is too mighty to be swallowed another preposterous conclusion likewise follows the customs fashions peculiarities caprices prejudices soil and climate of different countries would be ever varying the religion and virtue of each place so that men should have as many standards independent on each other of virtue and religion as there are independent states whereby truth and moral rectitude should become a mere political engine a mere ministerial maneuver of the state such unavoidable conclusions need only be barely mentioned with the keenest effect of ridicule to flash men in the face  this blessed deduction however which ought to afford such comfort and not ignoble triumph to every british bosom would amply soothe the writers trouble had he taken more to expose them need he mention it every grateful freeborn briton will at the instant anticipate it in his thoughts it is this that wherever despotism dark sullen despotism slavery and oppression subsist now in europe there the liberty of the press is destroyed absolutely annihilated a stigma of ineffable infamy on all tyrants had they time to be struck with it from the indulgence of their vices and sensualities  they can only make men slaves by keeping them in impenetrable darkness and ignorance no remove from instinctive tameness and bestial stupidity as soon as ever men ascend a degree above beasts of burden and brutes that feed on grass in happy light and knowledge they begin to be conscious of selfdignity feel the long smothered fire of heaven the incitements of immortality stir in their bosoms look upon their tyrant oppressors and taxmasters with indignant and disdainful eye dragging them to instant account as delinquents of the most capital atrociousness though pavilioned in all the terror and awfulness of majesty and empire  prescient of what monsters kings would eventually turn out as free agents in the progress of time is it any wonder that god repeatedly refused a king to his own people the jews and that when he was importuned by samuel to grant them one the gift was tacked with his hot displeasure and with the denunciation of endless woes and miseries that unavoidably must accompany it the language of heaven is so strong declaratory pointed and irresistible that the writer in selfvindication cannot but transcribe it here now therefore says god to samuel hearken unto their voice the voice of the people howbeit protest solemnly unto them the manner of the king that shall rule over them this shall be the manner of the king that shall rule over them  he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to till his ground and to reap his harvests and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers and he will take your fields and your olive yards even the best of them and give them to his servants and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give them to his officers and to his servants and he will take the tenth of your men servants and your maid servants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work and he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants and ye shall cry out in that day because of the king which ye shall have chosen and the lord will not hear you in that day   modern monarchy and tyranny wherever they are associated are here depicted to the life indeed so perfectly exact and literal that no mortal can mistake the prophetic description and fulfillment perhaps not one in a thousand has attended to this assage significant and striking as it is and coming even from almighty god himself for it cannot but be remarked on account of the multitudes of clrgymen among us that take upon them the utterance of inspiration to save mankind the trouble hat a thousand remarkable and important portions of the word of god are as little known among s as little attended to as if they were really pasages of the turkish alcoran or the empress of ussias new code of laws for her subjects  this reproachful ignorance it is that renders us such willing submissive slaves to corruption and vice to arbitray kings and insolent statesmen  britons upon the whole cannot but see the indissoluble connection fa beyond that of kings and subjects or even the ties of flesh and blood between light knowledge and the preservation of freedom and that the only means short of a miracle of perpetuating ligh and knowledge and diffusing them equally around is most religiously to preserve the liberty of the press from the rude impious check of kings and the contaminating breath of the servants of king  the liberty of the press brought about the reformation the same liberty of the press effected the thrice glorious revolution and the transcendent unspeakable blessings of both can alone be preserved and transmitted to a grateful posterity by the liberty of the press with respect to every advocate and stickler for restrictions on a free press he need only be asked in plain honest language would you be a papist would you be a slave a wretch degraded from your rank in creation to kiss the popes toe or a wretch no less degraded from the same rank to drink without trial the tyrants poisoned draught or stoop without asking a question to the bowstring of a mute   there is no medium here the pess must be totally free or not at all whenever its freedom comes to be defined or circumscribed we must forthwith apply to my lord chamberlain to know if god has permitted us to feel or not to think or not and to express our thoghts and feelings britons will never condescend to this till they become italian monks or dspicable musselmen the noted ovidian saying n medio tutissimus ibis is here a mean prosaical falsehood and holds a falchion at the throat of britih liberty and british independence  the halfconditioned friends of our constitution and those sagacious politicans that would take in our liberties and properties with half an eye will be ready to exclaim here what is not the press become the noted vehice of scandal slander and defamation is any thing sacred from its attempts even kings lords o commons  all this is acknowledged and that scandal slander and defamation are evils that require speedy discountenance and suppresson what then these and other evils inseparable from a free press if injurious to private character or property are all actionable at common law and cognizable by a jury of peers here then is an instant remedy for the disease but would you destroy the human body that is take away a mans life because that body is liable to infection and malady the sun has been and will be the wicked cause direct of many formidable natural evils would you deprive us of the sun the earth is often guilty of volcanos and earthquakes would you dispossess us of the earth to stand upon even the air around us times without number has been highly culpable in affording a menstruum and vehicle to plague and pestilence by which millions of our species have been cut off would you rob us of the air the pure salubrious lifesustaining air and to have done with particulars many kings of england have been tyrants persecutors and ruffians not behind the most savage in oppression and cruelty would you disinherit england of kings the anointed of the lord the breath of our nostrils and thus leave the lords and commons to fight it out like the dogs in the fable pellmell harumscarum rantumscantum higgledypiggledy topsyturvy this last is addressed to primeministers an argumentum ad hominem  perhaps no degree of levity becomes the writer on so solemn and momentous an occasion he asks the readers pardon therefore for the indecorum  indeed our times and the present critical situation of public affairs would seem objects that cannot be too seriously contemplated by the true lover of his country the good protestant and the virtuous good man the whole force of the empire exerted and more than its own force to subdue three millions of people placed by providence on an immense continent three thousand miles off who only originally offended respecting the mode not the matter of taxation is an unparalleled awful period in english history and especially affecting as the event is absolutely contingent and precarious hid deep in the bosom of futurity though the probability of success would seem much against the mother country rising against her children the old and infirm against the young and vigorous the reflecting brow and pensive countenance should be characteristic of britons at present however unaccompanied by the example of our rulers who mean time are hyeing to farces pantomimes and masquerades only a tyrant a glutton and a savage played on his fiddle when rome was in flames  papists have ceased to persecute and massacre protestants stung at last with compunction and remorse protestants in the full possession of this longwished cardinal blessing fall out among themselves snatch up the weapons which papists had laid down and destroy and murder one another let us hear no more of popish cruelty and popish devastations  add to this a whole bench of protestant bishops in the senate either promoted or abetted this horrid this ruinous this accursed social war except one or two illustrious and divine spirits illustrious and divine in spite of their mitres while the whole representative body of the clergy petitioned the king suspecting him to be naturally prone to justice and mercy to unsheath the sword of slaughter and plunge it in the bosoms of brethren citizens and countrymen the scene is of a piece criminally aggravated portentous unprecedented black and deformed throughout it is a national call upon god to behold a spectacle he hates and abhors one set of human beings butchering and destroying another for what that the vanquished may adorn the triumphal entrance of victory dragged at her chariot wheels or led through the streets in chains before her saturated eye  for what to satiate the longings of revenge the cravings of corrupt avarice the unsufferable pride of power and the unextinguishable thirst of empire and of human blood  in the foregoing strictures on kings and any that may afterward occur the writer would not be understood to involve the monarch on the throne whether the eventful and yet unknown operation of those vast armaments now fitted and gone out from great britain shall discover that his servants have acted wisely and faithfully toward him or grossly deceived and abused his confidence god only knows and a messenger from god can only tell the world thinks differently on this vast and interesting subject the writers sentiments may be collected from this preface and what follows whatever they may be termed he cannot suppress them without wounding his inward convictions and laying an embargo on his mind for doing which as a freeman and a protestant kings or ministers of state might reward him were he of consequence enough but could not recompense him  the diseases of a state like many of those that attack the human constitution are almost always chronical that is run through an indeterminate period not within the political physicians calculation before they end fatally nevertheless are as sure in their progress as they are slow while such numbers are daily permitted in the newspapers even by patent royal to deliver their thoughts of all disorders incident to our species on which immediately depend the lives of his majestys liege subjects and to prescribe their nostrums accordingly surely individuals may with the utmost license step forward on the theater of public notice to remark on the consumptive habit and decline of the body politic on which depend the liberty and property of his majestys liege subjects and propose without fee or reward that regimen and those palliatives which have been found most useful to such a constitution the chief of which are these a perfect conquest of the royal passions  a total relinquishment of extraordinary royal cares and worldly acquisitions  peace and tranquillity of the royal mind  temperance patience resignation and contentment with regard to the grand vicissitudes of the world under the direction of providence and superior to the councils of kings  authors writing on such a subject have a plea in their favor beyond medical speculatists and all patenteedoctors a plea really amounting to selfpreservation since writing on the diseases of the body politic they undoubtedly write on their own diseases being members of the body politic which every man has an indisputable right to do even independent of royal patent as a denizen of a popular state the matter rests here and here would rest the writers apology for the boldness and unreservedness of his remarks seeing the same sacred voluntary right that placed george iii and continues him on the throne of england in preference of an arbitrary romancatholic discarded prince privileges the present writer and every writer of the british empire to deliver his opinions freely of public measures and public exigencies nor can this preface be concluded in a more suitable manner than by most fervently wishing george iii the appointed and recognized first magistrate of these realms far more than the tumultuous crowded reflections of fluctuating empire  wishing him the present and the future consolations of a just and honest man the only character god attends to connected with his being the tenderhearted and affectionate father of his people independent of all selfishness and jealousy about the defense or extension of mere personal prerogative hitherto undefined and to all eternity undefinable except by the people  to have done  the sequel to common sense is an adventurous and unceremonious production like its forerunner but i hope is calculated to give britons and irishmen an idea and feeling of liberty which as to the writer it appears very few of them have had before at least if they really have it they act especially our representatives in parliament the delegates of the people as if they had it not which is infinitely worse than brutish insensibility liberty civil and religious is the sum of human good and the ever present object of every mans ambition who has not been previously acted upon and stupefied deprived of all principle manhood virtue dignity and spirit by the deadening squeeze of corruptions torpedinous hand  we seem to have lost all duty to god our maker governor and judge all consideration of his most excellent majesty in our preposterous shameful senseless impious idolatry of kings and the vicegerents of kings expending on the dust and rags of mortality called royal and imperial those high epithets those superlatively august titles most dread sovereign most sacred majesty most excellent majesty etc etc which alone belong to the god of heaven and the lord of universal nature on this account though little attended to god is a jealous god added to our vicious morals and the universal profligacy of our manners while we are mocking god in cathedrals churches and chapels with the conceit mummery and flippery of worship some awful revolutional punishment if not speedily deprecated and warded off certainly awaits our nation  a sequel to common sense etc notwithstanding what has been written by the inquisitive the ingenious the learned and the industrious on american affairs and that most people think the subject exhausted to me it appears i have no vanity on the occasion there are two considerations hitherto untouched that tend to throw a decisive air on the whole that is if we take our rule of judgment from first principles original rights and general rectitude confirmed and illustrated by that excellent morality delivered to us in revelation and not from the narrowed corporational maxims of a particular state or kingdom even with admired and idolized patriotism on ourside which must always give place to humanity and reverence for heaven nor do i think it would reflect any discredit on the greatest monarch or greatest statesman to be instructed in his duty from heaven less than the meanest private individual but surely it realizes a disgrace on modern times not to be gilded over or concealed that the grand movements of government are now conducted on the same confined partial mercenary despotic unjust cruel scale that was the standard of pagan times and heathenish manners nay i will be bold to affirm on a worse scale in many particulars our european kings are now called christian and many of them have pompous christian epithets appended to their armorial titles is there any idea annexed to the term christian or is it a mere convenient designation of popular honor to flourish at a marketcross in the mouth of an herald or king at arms our most christian kings are as little christian except in the rareeshow of public worship bordering upon idolatry and romance imposed upon them by fellow mortals as any that reigned a thousand years before christ from such premises we must not draw our conclusions from such models we must not finish our copies there is a standard beyond the etiquette of a court the records of parliament or the secreted schedules of a cabinet council that will always determine the true philosophical politician or political philosopher by this standard the standard of humanity enforced by christian ethics the following pages must be judged as indeed it is confessed they cannot abide any other i have no object but the establishment and elucidation of truth as leaning on general primary axioms not on mere territorial authority and machiavelian usage i have no lucrative expectations from any person in power nor would i accept of remuneration from any government upon earth in the light of a hireling pensioned writer i am in a professionary situation to live what can a monarch or his prime minister say more let my judges be the species at large let me have an appeal to heaven and let lord north try me when he pleases  while something more tremendously definitive than speculation is now carrying on between the principals in the grand contest the sons of leisure and literature may be indulged in the exercise of the pen unsupported and unsanctified by which the sword even supposing a caesar or an alexander to wield it had better have reposed in its scabbard covered with rust and edgeless from disuse the longest and strongest sword may precipitate all things before it in this world but what is this world in comparison with existence to come no more than a hillock of ants in the front of a sultans palace or in the midst of his gardens destroying one another did ants destroy one another like men the sword forms no defense in a future world nor is it admitted as evidence even upon earth a man with a sword in his hand would not be suffered to approach a bar of justice or assize no he must there appear disarmed if any person can be said to be disarmed who trusts his cause to judicial trial on the manly principles of right reason and convincing argument but not to lose sight of the two considerations we set out with let them be mentioned  they are these  first parliaments cannot be supreme in all cases whatsoever without being infallible also secondly colonies when they find themselves able that is come of age may in consequence of an unanimity nay a majority of voices throw off all subjection to the originating parent sat a power derived from god and authorized by the necessity of things to suppose the negative of either of these would be to suppose contradictions admissible  of these in their order  till it is impossible for parliaments to err to be tyrannical to be cruel and unjust the absolute supremacy of parliament is  vox et preterea nihil a word indeed of infinite sonorous energy in the mouth of him whose highest ambition looks but upward to a place or who wishes to preserve the place he has already got but witnesses of this kind are to be accounted partial and suborned  since then it is possible for parliaments to err all historical evidence proves it it follows of course that a power to detect that error exists somewhere in the aggregate body otherwise one error how fatal soever esteemed would beget another and yet another until the constitution should actually fall by the hands of its own guardians and protectors but who is to judge of the emergency the party aggrieved doubtless supposing however that party inconsiderable what is to be done why it must submit merely from necessity and the duty of selfpreservation but with an abiding consciousness of having been deeply injured connected with the consolation of a future appeal where arbitrary inforcement and superior numbers avail nothing unless it be to give aggravation to offense and crimson to guilt farther admitting the party aggrieved nearly on a par with the highhanded insolent aggressors in such a case all the laws of god and man authorize a spirit of defense resistance repulse and reprisal if unsuccessful in the attempt the want of success by no means tends to infer delinquency rather indeed the contrary in most cases as people unworthily disposed always wish to carry by numbers and dragooning violence what they are well aware the justice and integrity of their cause could never effectuate  this latent unrepressible spirit pervading the several parts of a mighty empire is in truth its basis and security for did not the governing powers decree and act under the intimidation and eventual interference of a greater power in diffuso every state would become despotic and every prince a tyrant the very freedom of a state is a standing recognition a tacit acknowledgment of a mightier power than the governing and the legislative existing in the body of the people in this sense the common adage  vox populi vox dei  has both significance and propriety  according to this representation it is plain that only despotic governments can in any appropriate sense be called supreme or infallible that is to say irreprehensible and uncontrollable by any cotemporary power upon earth for could their legislation be reprehended and controuled they should not any longer be despotic but free  to draw matters to a point  great britain is a free popular state this is acknowledged on all hands and remains an instance of her consummate wisdom persevering virtue and heroism truly respectable and venerable her freedom and popularity then amidst surrounding arbitrary nations serve as an illustrious and irrefragable proof that her legislation may be disputed and her executive powers resisted in many possible cases when they happen every member of the empire not to mention great provincial divisions of it has an undoubted right to judge for himself if inadequate to the momentous risque of resistance to do himself justice after every intermediate moderate step has been taken in vain he has a clear right to annihilate his connections with such a state and commence a freeman in any latitude or upon any shore more kindly to his prospects and more congenial with his sentiments god the supreme king and governor of all nations to whom monarchs are as subject as slaves invests him with this paramount privilege from the same principle of benignity and fitness he has planted the strong sense of selfpreservation in his breast to avoid the tiger and the lion when he finds himself unable to subdue either  to throw ones self in the way of a lion or a tiger when a method of escape presents itself would not be gallantry or spirit but foolhardiness and bedlamiteism  it is granted people may often imagine themselves aggrieved with little or no reason and that it is an heinous offense to disturb the peace and tranquillity of a state but then the possibility of the reverse becoming a necessitous duty lays a foundation of contingent resistance even in the most correct and guarded theory i shall beg leave to give an exemplification in point suppose parliament should conceive the idea and put it into operation of depriving a particular county of its two representatives yet nevertheless continue to levy taxes and all public burdens upon its inhabitants would not such a county have sufficient cause to think itself most injuriously treated and consequentially authorized to run through all the mediums petitional of retributory redress even undismayed by the last resort insurgency against its oppressors though no less high in official department than high in the flagitiousness of offense and if unable with any probable views of success to carry matters in this way would not the inhabitants of such a county merit the highest elogiums due to spirit and magnanimity should they nobly take the resolution of removing their effects and emigrating beyond seas to a more hospitable and righteous clime the seat of common right and independence  god in the first instance is the giver of property and the great protector of property to whom there lies an appeal from all mankind how great soever when it is unjustly and violently invaded and to whom we must be circumstantially accountable for its use and abuse its embezzlement and preservation as property aptly secured and judiciously laid out is effective of excellent ends and purposes in this world persons that have an important trust or deposit in their hands if from indolence carelessness want of spirit or want of fortitude they suffer it to fall a prey to wicked men private pilferers or open robbers however at first these wicked men varnished over their intentions with plausibility such persons are betrayers of their trust unworthy of generous confidence and chargeable with the worst of crimes at the bar of justice and equity all our possessions we hold from god in trust it cannot be ours absolutely and indefinitively because that same power whose gift or transfer the possession is disposes likewise of the possessors life either sooner or later therefore to suffer property to be lessened or taken away without our assent and concurrence is disloyalty and unfaithfulness to god duty to kings magistrates or agents of our own selection and recognition cannot supercede or set these aside  something of the same nature with the foregoing was actually seen to happen not long ago in ireland respecting not a county alone but a whole province the province of ulster the dissenters making by far the most considerable body in that province without being either represented or having personal votes in vestries were made subject to be taxed by act of parliament for the repairs and ornaments of churches places of worship against their consciences at the discretion of people too much disposed to hold them in durance and contempt it is true an act so arbitrary ungenerous and unmanly was no proof of the spirit of the times it originated with a single person a great ecclesiastic ecclesiastics have always been at the bottom of slavery and oppression and was suffered to pass somewhat unaccountably through the negligence of some and the supine inattention of others in which circumstances most dark and wicked schemes are pushed into form  the dissenters to a man were irritated and alarmed being conscious of no defaulture they had several meetings and consultations touching the necessity of declaring their united sentiments on so critical an occasion and at length unanimously agreed to petition parliament they did so from their respective parish districts in a decent dispassionate but able manner the prayer of their petitions was heard by a sensible liberalminded majority in the house of commons the obnoxious act repealed and peace and security restored to a vast body of opulent wellaffected people who otherwise might have been precipitated into that species of illhumour and discontent which every wise government will always appease and soothe in the first instance where a useful and numerous set of men are concerned  indeed it cannot but be observed here that the procedure of the governing powers with reference to the vestryact contradicted their general line of conduct in american affairs the vestryact and the right of internally taxing the colonies proceeded on the same principle the ostensible cause of the one was the delinquency of a riotous mob in the town of boston of the other a refractory disposition shown by a few dissenting congregations with regard to the repair of churches in both cases how inadequate the cause to the effect how disproportionate the punishment to the offense  when the hearts of steel committed such disturbances in two or three northern counties had government sent fleets and armies to punish ireland by the demolition of her towns and the destruction of her inhabitants what brasscomplexioned courtier would have held up his face to justify the deed the instances are exactly parallel i cannot possibly look upon them in any other light for the same reason that america is now surrounded with predatory fleets and invasive armies and the taxation law against the dissenters was enacted the trade of ireland should now be destroyed her maritime towns thrown into conflagration and her children slaughtered by an unpitying soldiery on account of the acts of insurgency and violence committed by the steelboys  politicians may refine away the similarity as politicians have before now refined away private judgment and the liberty of the subject into indefeasible right nonresistance and church authority but all such refinements are only those of satan to establish his kingdom upon earth on the ground of general humanity the law of nations jurisprudential rectitude and political integrity subject to a test paramount to them all the divine law for sure we call ourselves christians i invite any one to prove that the above cited cases are not perfectly in point and his arguments shall have fair play should such a person object to the invitation being anonymous let him make his best efforts on the subject and the writer hereof promises to step forward in reply with his name at full length to his book not begrudging him the full advantage of all that the learned doctors johnson and shebbeare have declaimed on the same side with himself  it is true the americans stand itemed rebels in the parliament records and in the k  s speeches but with the most dutiful respect for the s  and veneration for the council of the nation i do aver it that no k  or parliament upon earth has authority to fix the meaning of language for me or alter the nature of things by a particular arbitrary use of terms many great and good men about the k  and in parliament reprobated the term and protested against the application of it are no men honest but such as are paid for being dishonest i mean those in lucrative places and on the pension list not to mention the unmarshalled tribe standing on the tiptoe of court expectation  i may take my license of speech and nickname those rebels and traitors to the then crowned and sceptred monarch that brought william into england and afterward set him upon the throne in consequence of which george now inhabits a royal palace and reigns over a mighty would to god they were a united people will their lordships b  n  m  s  g  h  etc etc give me credit for my term if not why should i a free member of the british empire though not in any place at court give them credit for theirs language is common to the species and cannot be monopolized or unalterably fixed till our legs and necks shall be first fitted to the yoke and the fetters in such a case language would be of no use to us more than to the ox or the ass for were we to upbraid our tyrants it would only be to have our tongues cut out of our heads lest in the aggrievement and indignation of our spirits we should spit upon them next  this matter may require a farther discussion the discussion of common sense and common honesty  what government led at the discretion of lords north mansfield and company now calls rebellion should be styled by the same legislative authority directed by a chatham or a camden a necessary laudable spirit of resistance that identical spirit which seated george iii on the throne of the british empire and excluded for ever the lineal heir of these realms are the former noble lords endued with infallibility in their interpretation of words beyond the latter who that thinks or reads beyond a primmer other than a pensioner or the hungry expectant of a pension will take upon him to assert this oh will it be replied by our legal vociferators of rebellion that the latter noble lords are out of place and would stretch every nerve to get in hence their abhorrence of what they affect to call our present court idioms and juntonian phraseology even allowing this its utmost validity which i would never allow but for arguments sake still it amounts to a presumption only a bare begging of the question the now vernacular usage of speech crying out rebellion rebellion within the environs of st jamess rests upon the proof of the same arbitrary disingenuous timeserving kind actually positive the ministerial exclaimers of rebellion have all in substantial possession places pensions douceurs gratuities almost beyond arithmetic the above therefore is one of these unfortunate proofs that have two edges the one obtuse and harmless the other keen and cutting those assailants that use it fondly imagining they are doing wondrous execution and dealing wounds and death around them never advert to the circumstance of their having mistaken the side deeply wounding and mangling themselves without once piercing even the scarfskin of those they assail  my lords chatham and camden positively will not call the americans rebels because they want places at court my lords north and mansfield reiterate the odious appellation and paste it in capitals on the back of the americans because they have places ergo a negative must take place of an affirmative or else the former right hon peers have indeed adhered to the chasteness purity dignity and manliness of language the court and its dependants using the abominable hueandcry terms rebels traitors in doubtful cases and by no means universally acknowledged is the same thing as two persons met on the ground in single combat and the one calling the other a rascal and a scoundrel what lord in administration so critically stationed would call his antagonist a rascal or a scoundrel should any lord act so unlike himself before he discharged his pistol or made his lounge he would deserve to be treated with silent but manly contempt or to be horsewhipt by his adversarys coachman rather than indulged with the honorable event of a duel  it may be argued that the constitution must be preserved at any rate and whatever the expense of blood and treasure its preservation may require if we would exist as a nation or people at all agreed but the true way of preserving the constitution is to know precisely the diseases it is liable to and when they happen to apply the proper remedies otherwise political death must ensue of course as natural death when the human body labors under a disorder for which there is no cure moreover the americans are the people at present that are preserving the constitution by defending the principle on which it is founded the right of assent and consent in taxation either personal or substitutional without which no state can subsist free but soon sink into abject slavery even through the medium of its own taxational largesses supremacy of parliament on the one hand and unconditional submission on the other are the dogmas and language of turks not of britons god himself requires not unconditional submission from his creatures but submission on the clearest moral evidence and internal conviction g  iii and his highpriests n  h m  s  d g  m  ne we suppose are beings of superior order to their maker  in short it would not be our country or the general interests of the species we should assist by taking our construction of words from the noble lords north and mansfield even with the erudite lexicographical critic dr johnson at their elbow in preference of the still nobler lords chatham and camden but the prime minister for the time being and his satellitary circle had lord chatham or lord camden directed the helm of affairs for some time past the inglorious and destructive emergency which now serves as an apology for official despotism and ministerial depredation to the honor of our species and the glory of britain would not have marked the historical page of the times with civil blood nor sent abroad through the land among kinsmen citizens and neighbors the horrid the infernal cry of murder  the plain english therefore of the whole is this a senatorial majority let them tell from what ennobled disinterested selfdenied principle feel themselves pertinaciously disposed to support the lords mansfield and north in preference of the lords chatham and camden is this the amount of parliamentary integrity parliamentary public spirit parliamentary affection for george iii and the protestant succession or shall a murray or a north in point of preeminent rectitude of intention solidity of honest talents and celebrity of fame stand unblushing competitors with a pit or a pratt  the latter last war reduced the haughty spaniard and the gaul to the humility of soliciting peace at the footstool of george iii and spread the conquering names of britons to the farthest parts of the earth let us be told what the former have done to excite admiration and gratitude if we except their superlative merit in plunging us into all the complicated horrors and miseries of civil war a war among kinsmen brethren and friends  compare them together  nay rather let every freeborn briton lay his hand on his untutored heart and generously exculpate the americans who have as true a right to property from god as the premier or his master in their congressional resistance to a tyrannical rapacious vindictive minister who is now convulsing a mighty and hitherto a glorious empire in order to glut a herd of needy dependants with rapine and plunder the rapine of virtuous citizens and the plunder of genuine protestants   a private writer taking so much upon him with such freedom and boldness will no doubt be severely censured by those who are accustomed to think differently on the subject perhaps find their account in so doing it may be sufficient in reply to this to observe that many writers on the contrary side have written at least with equal boldness and freedom with a strain of acrimonious dogmatism and abusive inflation of language superadded not to be imitated by writers that have no partial views or private inducements  not to be imitated by the present writer to speak in the first person of allowable egotism though a private and an anonymous writer i am a denizen of the british empire not to mention a higher title still a denizen of gods universal empire the world i support in my place and variously circumstanced the exigencies of the state help to pay the army and navy those brave fellows that hitherto have been prodigal of their blood in the defense of liberty pure and uncorrupted from court pollution nay to ascend in my importance i help to maintain george iii to feed him to clothe him and incircle his person with majesty by contributing to pay the public taxes what were george iii king of england without his thousands and his ten thousands like me to pay their quotas into the national treasury  true what i pay is but a mite compared with the proportions of others but a levied mite had once an high compliment paid it and by a good judge i also gratefully acknowledge that i have full value received in present protection and freedom for every tax i pay even to the light that shines through my window and the fire that burns on my hearth what then  this very circumstance creates an anxiety not to be repressed looking forward to the preservation and continuance of this protection and freedom without which the present possession would be little beyond a purse of gold in our pockets on hounslowheath this gives me also and sanctifies my right to speak freely of public measures in which i am as truly concerned as any prime minister of the land if the british empire be lost leaning on its first principle virtuous equal liberty i lose my all in the immediate or even the remote prospect of this shall i hold my tongue because i have not a paltry pension or ministerial bribe for speaking  my right to speak and write so far as i refrain from injuring private characters and private property which i shall ever do is beyond that of a member of parliament or privy counselor by that original and divine authority which makes all kings members of parliament and privy counselors i write and were it not for this transcendant and unalienable right lodged with man by the great creator of heaven and earth kings members of parliament and privy counselors instead of applying annually to the people for the very breath of their nostrils the very meat they eat and the clothes they wear would in the persons of bailiffs and constables enter our  more than royal palaces  our virtuous habitations empty our coffers into their pockets the fruit of our honest industry and perhaps in an act of uniform familiarity ravish our wives and debauch our daughters  there is a time for national rest and constitutional slumbers but there is likewise a time would to god it were not what now throws shadows on our dials for the thunderclothed vehemence of the mouth and the lightningkindled enthusiasm of the pen the cannon even under the match of a briton cannot silence the one nor the sword even wielded by a briton cannot outflash the other  long eternally long may the experiment remain to be tried and britain  almost imperceptibl in the internal poise of its three equipolent estates be like the earth with nothing material or visible to support it yet balanced unmoveably on its own axis   from the above induction of particulars it would appear that the supremacy of parliament is in fact nothing else in our corrupt degenerate day than the supremacy of the prime minister whose supremacy can be no farther absolute than that of the enthroned roman pontiff and his no more respectable than the sweat and filth of his toe however extended for adosculation  there are many things parliament cannot do with all its height of pretension and magnificence of claim it cannot set aside the verdict of a jury in a criminal cause it cannot interfere in the business of elections for its own members otherwise than by its speaker issuing writs it cannot take away from the king the power of a negative on all its legislative acts it cannot impose taxes of interior operation where there is no deliberative assent of the people either personally or representatively present nor to mention no more instances can it prolong itself beyond its octennnial term of existence with all these marks of impotence and nonefficiency on its forehead to hear of parliamentary supremacy i e omnipotence and infallibility they are convertible ideas forces one however unwilling to picture to himself a snail carrying its little shell about with it but assuring the limacious circle around that it is indeed an elephant with a cohort of soldiers on its back or an ephemeron stepping into existence today and out of it tomorrow but at the same time declaring itself immortal  all these acts of parliamentary impotence just now specified are however resistless acts of spontaneity in the people at large whenever they are struck with the expedience and necessity of interposing i e whenever court measures and ministerial edicts have a direct instant tendency to issue in their slavery at such an awful critical period god the monarch paramount of the world calls upon the people to do their posterity right by emancipating themselves from those bolts and fetters they were never created for  god  under whom the greatest emperor that wears a diadem is no more than a viceroy or governor of a province under an earthly king and both no more when compared with the majesty and almightiness of the sebjects at large than a mastersheep at the head of the flock with a bell about his neck  such a renunciation of tyrannical masters the elastic recovery of a people to the original poise of their own rights were such a sentimental exertion of duty to god the alone supreme king of all the earth as the jews would have exhibited when they got a king from heaven in wrath had they thrown themselves upon the clemency and providence of god by once more recognizing him as their alone king and governor hear their own appropriate language to samuel pray for thy servants unto  lord thy god they durst not call him our god that we die not for we have added unto our sins this evil  to ask a king  the people being thrown into disorder and confusion in consequence of this reassumption of original rights is no objection to the effort against voluntary slavery as nothing can be pure that owes its existence to art without a previous fermentation and as no future system can become perfect and permanent without the experience of former systems having been imperfect and precarious beside men would always wish to suffer with hope if suffer they must rather than to suffer without it there is no hope however in slavery but  death  let it be understood here to blunt the edge of outrageous remark that the writer would not insinuate the lawfulness or expediency of an effort in the people till the last extreme the impassable and unsurmountable extreme shall call them forth like a voice from heaven to the field  the people alone therefore not kings or parliaments can with any decency challenge the high prerogative of being supreme that is ultimately decisive and unresponsible kings and parliaments are in the last instance responsible to those that made them  the people who made the people  god  nihil vero verius  kings and parliaments otherwise would be of no use to the people but rather a curse and a scourge it is owing entirely to their being controulable and accountable in the dernier resort that freemen could derive any advantage from their rulers and governors for unquestionably no body of men would be so stupid and senseless as to choose a ruler or governor to deteriorate their condition or render their right to or possession of property more ambiguous and periclitated than in a state of nature the social compact and the complicated form of government grounded upon it commenced for the greater security of life personal freedom and property but if in such a situation they become less secure then is the state of nature preferable to that of society and government  to descend from general to local views from great to little objects  the rev john wesleys arguments and those of all writers on his side wrought in johnsonian tissue as they are must pass for naught till the above leading data are disproved picking straws off the surface will never gratify genuine ambition while inestimable beds of pearl below deride our want of courage or want of apparatus to dive for it political expedience connected with a particular system chiefly lucrative to men officially employed and general rectitude involving the common concerns of mankind and referable to god as the supreme arbiter and judge are two distinct things nor was it becoming a christian divine he would be thought so to ground his deductions on the former and not on the latter his deductions indeed they cannot be called the rev john wesley is a plagiary without being honest enough to apologize for it dr johnson not only furnished him with his reasonings if such they may be called but his language also true we are told the critical reviewers would screen him most shamefully by alleging he could not find better thoughts or expressions an excuse for all literary theft even did a new set of reviewers arise pilfer the critical and vend their monthly labors as their own he could not adopt better on the side he took but shall a man counterfeit the current coin of a kingdom from the circumstance of his not having more valuable models to take his impressions from nor was it a seemly excuse for robbing a great and growing people of their rights and franchises that he had before robbed a celebrated author of his writings  our second consideration remains to be brought before the reader it may not be improper to mention here the outlines of two gentlemens opinions that have figured but widely differed in the dispute between england and america i mean edmond burke esquire and dr tucker dean of gloucester notwithstanding the latter affects to despise the explosive effects of the formers rhetorical thunder and lightning the most cursory reader cannot but remark that the rev dean found himself violently scorched by the one and sonorously roused to wounded selfconsequence by the other he expresses great deference for the house of commons and modestly hints his regret in entering on a question then before that house but respecting mr burke a member thereof he professedly loosens himself from all ceremony and indeed would notably reduce him to a mere senatorial mummy of splendid diction simile and metaphor where is the deans decorum or consistency here it is not the house that covers the members but the members that constitute the house that ought to be considered in connection with the deans idea of augustness for the same reason that the house of commons is entitled to deference and respect mr burke is whether in or out of the house in either case his identity is the same and as he is confessedly one of the most superior speakers there both with regard to the weight of argumentative ability and masterly display of elocution he certainly comprises in his single person a degree of augustness and preeminence beyond the one half of that assembly made up of mere monosyllabic yeas and noes who if they have capacity cannot discover it and if they have knowledge cannot communicate it the learned dean therefore while he pays his tribute to the house of commons and at the same time would withhold it from mr burke undoes with his right hand what he had endeavored to do with his left this must either be the amount of our deans attempt or he must be understood to mean that the stone and mortar of the house of commons and the benches on which the members sit actually constitute the house  waving however the point of contrariety between the house and mr burke to me it appears no breach of deference or respect for the augustness of the representative body in parliament assembled to take up and canvas any subject though instantly in deliberation before that body the clergy are always excessively complaisant and well bred the same right that authorizes us to send representatives to parliament authorizes us to think speak and write even antecedent to the decisions of that assembly every member of a free state sits in a greater than any parliament house  in the area of humanity a theater only bounded by the poles where he sits and deliberates in right of a summons from the great creator instead of a writ issued by the speaker of a popular local assembly respect and deference in durance to the latter and not to the former in their consequential stages of advance always arrive at that obsequiousness and submission which the despot cannot but contemplate with satisfaction and the vain empty man ever accepts of with avidity  with regard to a plan of colonistic accommodation the point agitated between these two gentlemen singularly important and interesting as its consequences would seem it can never be brought to any issue so as to carry conviction to either of their bosoms they proceed on different data and opposite principles the great senator maintains that the colonies are not in rebellion but urged to selfdefence and irritated to hostile repulsion by arbitrary exaction and highhanded assessments on this ground the excellent speaker has held forth a plan of accommodation judicious solid pertinent and salutary alike becoming freemen to offer and freemen to accept the learned dean on the contrary falls in with the ministers majority in parliament and considers the americans as rebels flying in the face of the parent state and aiming at a traitorous independence hence have subjected themselves to all that parliamentary indignation and resentment which have been avowed and put into executive force against them the rev dean has quite forgot here that no one is a rebel till he has been proved such on trial before his peers and at common law and that to nickname and punish a man as a rebel or traitor prior to his being tried and found guilty is the same thing as to punish an individual as a robber or murderer before he has been proved such a royal proclamation can neither make nor set aside law except in france or turkey if it supercedes trial at bar or by jury it supercedes courts of justice and renders parliaments useless  in short the deans reasonings and conclusions in general and to say the utmost of them rest upon one pillar only  the supremacy and omnipotence of parliament if the substruction can be removed the superstructure falls of course nothing can be supreme or omnipotent without being infallible also till parliaments become absolutely infallible i believe it will not happen in our day parliaments are  unomnipotent and unsupreme to say that parliament is supreme and omnipotent in all cases whatsoever is saying that lord north or the ostensible minister for the time being is supreme and omnipotent in all cases whatsoever while the minister holds the national bag as judas did his masters he turns parliaments at pleasure as the winds turn the weathercock but not alas with the same innocence and want of consciousness  it is no less notorious than the false grandeur gaming dissipation and shameful luxury of the times that placemen pensioners and military servants always make up the determining majority in both houses a packed disqualified unconstitutional junto not excepting the right rev bench can such be called competent equitable judges any more than jurymen or witnesses in trials of life and death and property who have been bribed and suborned  the analogy is pointed and decisive and evinces with what matureness of judgment as well as superiority of talents the oratorial light of the british senate revolved his subject but alas the era the honorable and inestimable era of accommodation is now over in despite of a chatham and a burke whose reasonings one would have thought were sufficient to illuminate a world instead of three insular spots the americans have declared themselves independent while our egregious rulers sitting on their hobbyhorse of supremacy and omnipotence have the sweets of a sugar plumb to roll in their mouths for losing one half division of a great empire hitherto in conjunction with america the arbitress of europe and empress of the seas     colonization is the voluntary deliberate act of a few leaving the parent country to begin an adopted one in a distant region under the instant disadvantages of an unknown situation inhabited by hostile natives paucity exposure want of order and want of form the parent country is no less naturally induced to protect cherish and fondle this infant colony than parents of another kind to protect cherish and fondle their puling offspring nor would a dereliction of duty and kind affections in the one case be a greater crime than in that of the other as our children run through the progressive stages of infancy childhood youth manhood etc and demand attentions from their parents applicable and appropriate to each stage so do colonies from their first settlement to their ripening into internal subordination and empire and are certainly entitled to attentions of a similar nature from the mother state but by the police of all well constituted kingdoms a certain time arrives which we are accustomed to call the age of adultness when nonage ceases when children become independent of parents and privileged to commence in their own persons possessors of property under no parental limitation or control in a correspondent way colonies by the persevering exercise of virtue and industry the melioration of their lands and the extension of their commerce added to the capital circumstance of a prodigious still increasing population are authorized by the law of nature and providence the only original binding moral law to stand on their own legs and to do for themselves unconnected feudally or legislatively with the parent state in their political nonage indisputably they felt and grew beneath the protecting hand of the parent who in return for protection and by way of entire indemnification beheld a concentration of the childrens commercial goods and property annually pouring into her coffers but shall this monopoly be still insisted on and enforced this stated requital for favors received when the favors are no longer needed or required real children under age owe passive obedience to parents as a return for support and maintenance but come of age passive obedience ceases of course with the support and maintenance being no longer requisite in both cases the necessity of the thing ought to strike us with the full force and energy of truth  did not children at a certain time become independent of their parents with regard to free agency and moral accountableness there would happen in an indefinite number of instances such an accumulation of domestic government as would soon grow to be loaded with all the miseries and abominations of the feudal system perfectly oppressive and unsufferable even to the destruction of national police and socialcompact a father might live to be a greatgrandfather and under his absolute dominion in one house at the same time have two or three hundred children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren accommodated and employed respectively as he himself should arbitrarily dictate often perhaps only influenced by the restless lust of rule caprice spleen or unaccountable prejudice in this way children should be incapacitated to act as free members of a free state so that such a monopolization and perpetuation of domestic authority would not only interfere with but end in the total abolition of municipal freedom political subordination and personal property wisely therefore have all governments in selfpreservation fixed the term of maturity and the boundaries of adolescential subjection in short set children free from all ties to parents but those of reverence gratitude and affection which are spontaneous conditional duties always at the command of an excellent and deserving object  with regard to colonies the precise period of political adultness has not been ascertained for what power is competent to ascertain it there are no visible existing powers that we know of above the kingdoms of this earth it is therefore the alone province of heaven to take the lead in this magnificent and magnitudinous affair to fix the ne plus ultra of supremacy on the one hand and of submission on the other heaven indeed has not left the exact limits upon record so as not to be mistaken but the sense and will of heaven may be clearly made out from the plainest deductions of reason and common sense which in many intricate and doubtful cases are our only guides and the only infallible standard men have upon earth in penetrating the art and disguise of things bringing forward primordial privileges and authenticating the stamp of derived and delegated power from that possessively underived and undelegated except from heaven  should we leave the decision of the matter to parent states the term of colonian puberty would never arrive states as regulated by mere men are as subject to a wretched poverty of intellect a sordid narrowness of spirit a selfish mediocrity of concession as individuals selfishness though variously habited and disguised is the characteristic of polished cultivated humanity except in punctilious attentions to one another among members of official departments at levees and in drawingrooms where shall we find an individual who will coolly and willingly relinquish to another what he looks upon as his sole property and the chief support of his personal significance among mankind or where shall we find a great kingdom that will coolly and willingly relinquish to a colonian rival or cotemporary in power what it looks upon as its sole property and the chief support of its territorial signification among nations we must not seek for either instance in the latitudes of our earth yet the negative of conduct thrown into interrogation here with respect to individuals is the opprobrium of our nature and the malady of all societies one set of men gorged to the throat with luxury another set starving but for our alms on our dunghills and with respect to nations the same negative was the destruction of the grecian and roman empires which instead of supporting themselves at the zenith of power and glory by the means that acquired them internal virtue temperance and piety vainly thought to consolidate universal dominion by exorbitant exactions and arbitrary stretches of authority in their distant provinces and colonies whereby they roused up such a spirit of dissatisfaction and resentment in the members against the head as soon issued assisted by interior vice immorality and licentiousness in their final ruin and extinction particular kingdoms therefore must not be admitted umpires to decide the weighty and momentous question of colonian maturity or ripeness for selfgovernment  a kingdom to all eternity were kingdoms eternal would no more give up its colonies to the liberty and independence itself enjoys than a tyrannical unnatural parent would wish to liberate a son from his jurisdiction were he not liable to be forced by the law of his country and indeed in most cases by the necessity of the thing itself but let the consequences be seriously and heartily marked  were there no compulsory statutes for the liberation of children from their parents at a specified time parents even the most opulent would not be able to maintain their successions of offspring except in wretchedness and penury which in a very few generations would reduce the wealthiest nations to the condition of indians living on the uncultivated fruits of the earth and the unsolicited fish crowding to their shores and even should industry be admitted to take place between a father and his sons still the admission is shackled with an absurdity impossible to be thrown off which would shortly annihilate the whole paterfamilial dynasty in instances of disagreements between father and son disagreements not in the nature of things to be avoided strength bodily strength would be the lex ultima judicandi as force is confessedly the ultima ratio regum a son might be very often stronger than his father or two or more sons might conspire against a father and subdue him whereby the whole domestic chain of government would be unlinked while brawny limbs and athletic shoulders not wise heads and experienced hoary locks would bear off the chaplet of victory and the younger reign in the elders stead   thus it appears that the adult domestic period has been established in all well regulated states with a degree of sapient foresight on which their existence as well as property depends the adult period of colonies comes next to be considered such a period it has been observed would never arrive were it left to the option and discretion of the colonian parent but notwithstanding this peevish impoverished and jaundiced maxim of state shall it never arrive this is just saying with more illiterate dogmatism than truth that states shall never grow old diseased enfeebled and decrepit i e it is an attempt to stop the course of nature arrest the progress of mortal labefaction and check the material dissolution of parts suspend the attrition of wheels and counteract the wearing of machinery states are subject to all the vicissitudes of the human body like it must increase decrease and moulder into dust shall an old palsied man then wrestle with the young and vigorous the diseased with the healthy the weaker with the stronger  in other words shall parent states be eternal and shall colonies never become parent states absurd and fanciful indeed  mark the extravagance and selfdelusion here in many supposable cases not to mention cases that have really happened colonies may become greater wealthier and more powerful than the birthgiving state at such a crisis what is to be done shall the lesser legislatively control the greater the poorer the wealthier or the weaker the stronger  the questions would seem to answer themselves and may be left to lord north himself if he has not altogether abandoned the sterling currency of idea and language the reverse of his conduct with regard to the coin and has not folded up for ever and for ever the uncorporational rectitude and integrity of things in the plaitings of his aulicrobe or the duplications of his blue ribbon  all nations upon earth were once colonies except the first stationary spot of its inhabitants and even that may be called a colony from heaven at least so long as the disposition of heaven reigned there peace love friendship and content all nations were once in the most helpless condition of infant territory and nascent civilization how have these colonies expiated the guilt of their becoming great and flourishing kingdoms the terror and admiration of the world the ethiopic the grecian and the roman lord north and his conclave of senators ought to write maledictory epitaphs to their memory send some of their order from their silent or abused seats in parliament upon an eastern tour and there instead of falling down on their knees with sepulchral decency unutterable consciousness and holy admiration spurn the ashes of their dead generals heroes and orators trample on the marmorean relics of their glory and deface the ingravements of their unenvied immortality they should find no interruption in the solitude of their exploits as their consciences were left behind them but from the remonstrances of awakened echoes or the inarticulated murmurings of passing winds  the progress from colonian nonage and imbecility to the adultness and lustihood of empire has been as observable since the beginning of time as the growth of the human body from infancy to manhood the world may be called a great body made up of continents islands empires kingdoms principalities and states its individuals in a figurative sense a kingdom likewise is a great lesser body made up of men and women its individuals in a real sense men and women have a progression of growth from birth to the period of legal maturity nothing can obstruct or limit this regular growth without doing violence to god and nature as well as society a crime multiform and penal equal to mutilation maiming dismembering partially robbing life of its subsistence or totally destroying it empires kingdoms and states have likewise a progression of increase from their first colonizing existence to the ripened era of their independence nothing can obstruct or limit this regular increase without doing violence to god in the first instance the king of all kings and the lord of all lords a crime for which kings ministers and parliaments must be one day as responsible as those tyrants and monsters that would by external implements and force a thing quite possible stop the growth of an infant to a child of a child to a youth or of a youth to a man  this seems to be the true and unaffected view of the subject unwarpt by party and unallied to worldly hopes and fears which alas too often serve to silence the voice of truth fully its brightness or muddy its channels it is so obvious and reasonable that i cannot help wondering it does not strike every mind left to its own freedom and not abashed to borrow light from christianity that admirable but not half enough admired system of right conduct pure equity disinterested justice genuine ambition refined morals exquisite philosophy gentle affections and generous principles without which adopted and revered in courts and cabinets no kingdoms can rise to greatness become greatness or secure greatness any more than individuals this i would assert and hand down to posterity could any thing of mine reach posterity under every circumstance of discouragement and unpopularity and notwithstanding the accommodated reasonings of dr johnson dean tucker and sir john dalrymple without forgetting to mention our little tabernacle politician though indeed nothing better than a dangling satellite at the belt of jupiter though blunt and bold truths coming unawares upon men and overturning accustomed modes of thinking at first rather tend to fix the character of extreme singularity on the author than to convince the reader yet a time will come when the unrestrained powers of reflection and the natural good sense of mankind will take the lead of habit fashion and prejudice like reaction recovering that is reinstating what was lost by simple action or pressure or to speak more justly like condensed air and concentrated sunbeams regaining that medium and expansion made their natural properties by the great creator and best accommodated to general use and benefit  many people in the official departments of the state who somehow or other imagine themselves called upon to defend government at all hazards whether right or wrong will probably be very ready to exclaim against the bold and free spirit of these remarks not spying the beam in their own eye politicians indeed are not obliged to be good christians they will call them republican and in their latitude and tendency dangerous to civil administration as well as disrespectful to the k  yet such persons will as probably never reflect that while the foregoing remarks can only do imaginary harm even upon their own supposition of their being dangerous they themselves do substantial irreparable harm to the state to their king and country by the dissoluteness and profligacy of their live it scarcely can be denied that most of our rulers are men of gross morals and irreligious private conduct it may be argued they are not worse than other members of the state but if they are no better they are virtually worse as persons in power and trust ought to be exemplary for superior and uncommon virtues the routine of public worship is not religion though from the throne to the cottage it unaccountably passes as such  luxury effeminacy and sensuality these are the hydra evils that hurt a state sap the foundations of government and undermine slowly but surely the platform of municipal freedom while the essay writer with the worst intentions only gives the world an opportunity to examine and in cases of error in his positions of confuting him hereby government in truth acquires additional strength splendour and beauty instead of being injured no theoretical reasoning or speculative opinions can disturb or periclitate a state though they may disturb and periclitate men in the possession of abused power and illacquired opulence if bad they are easily answered and as assignable to oblivion as rockets and soapbubbles into air if good that is founded on unalterable maxims and the general convictions of mankind no opposition can suppress them nay the opposition of courts and hierarchies will add to their currency and effect but what remedy can radically conquer national degeneracy a depravity of manners infecting the whole bodypolitic with fashion and breeding and the clergy their grand allies  the command of the powers of a state and selfcommand being at the head of government and at the head of selfgovernment are quite different things ministers without the last can never acquit themselves honorably or successfully with respect to the first private virtue is the only foundation of public as the whole can no other way be made up but of the parts and public virtue is the only secure basis of national peace freedom prosperity and glory to loosen the links of this chain were to disjoin vegetable circulatory life and the growth of the oak or to separate light and heat from the body of the sun  alas while the ostensible friends and servants of government are sending out mighty fleets and armies to support what they are pleased to call the honor and character of the nation they tarnish its true honor and character in the private paths of life i e while they stick a feather in britannias cap they are aiming a dagger at her heart by the vicious dissipation corrupt prodigality and pleasurable extravagance of their lives fleets and armies in this case are no more than the bravadoing of presumption and confidence and

the glorious and superb sabric of british liberty without even the consolation of one truly valiant virtuous man like him of gaza to consecrate the mighty devastation  while our parliamentary court leaders our cabinet and privy counselors by means of the basest venality breach of honor and breach of integrity to their constitutional masters the people get the public money into their hands to squander away on parade of living a false style of life profusion licentiousness and libertinism the overthrow of the once illustrious empires of greece and rome to squander away on parasites sycophants mistresses lackies horses and dogs they can never succeed or prosper in any undertaking except in destroying sooner or later our happy and envied constitution  they are with veritable

flame be thrown   were politicians philosophers and philosophers genuine christians or did philosophy and revelation as well as politics conspire to form a patriot k and statesman kings and statesmen would not only consider the legislative supremacy of a state as definable but the limits of empire likewise terminable generally speaking the less extended and stretched any of them be on the juster and surer basis it rests if one has a right to assume jurisdictive omnipotence in all cases whatsoever every state has however different in internal conformation wisdom virtue and policy but no state can have it but from colonian derivation teritorial increment and gradual accretion of numbers associating together therefore all colonies that can keep off the attacks of foreign invaders let them be who they will whether quondam friends or hereditary enemies so as to attend uninterruptedly to interior improvement and cultivation may attain to that opulence and strength on which alone the so much boasted supremacy of states can be founded the ruling legislative powers of one state indeed may truly be styled supreme and infallible with regard to the ruling powers of any other state but that these ruling powers should arrogate supremacy in a state within which they originated and are contingently liable to be curtailed and destroyed is such an instance of extreme human vanity in rulers and governors as will serve to sanctify all the execrable tyrants that have ever deformed and dishonored the earth or ever shall  we have already seen that all kingdoms without exception were once colonies it is only stepping high enough up in the records of time to be as certainly convinced of this as that every man was once a boy and every parent once a child even great britain itself now standing on the pinnacle of selfeulogy and selfidolization is an example of it what was right fit lawful necessary expedient and practicable two four six thousand years ago if we may suppose the world so old is right fit lawful necessary expedient and practicable now in the year mdcclxxvi of the christian era if politicians and courtiers can advance any thing in redarguation they must recur to that pitiful policy which we call corporational by way of stigma and reproach a policy which would stimulate great britain to plunder and destroy france spain germany and all the nations of the earth were she able for one kingdom has no more right from god the guardian and protector of kingdoms to rob and destroy another than one individual has to rob and destroy another individual in the latter case it would be private felony and murder in the former public complicated unbounded undefinable felony and murder with regard to the private commissions of offenses so atrocious all civilized states have appointed the most awful tribunals and exemplary punishments indeed in simple selfpreservation as robbers and murderers unchecked would throw all kingdoms into uproar distraction and misery is it to be supposed then that in public national commissions of the same atrocious offenses god the king and judge supreme of all the earth will take no cognizance appoint no judicial bars of trial no final punitive award then should god exhibit himself to creation as inferior to an earthly sovereign in sagacity foresight and prudence as in consequence of these public enormous commissions if unrestrained by his unseen but almighty interference his general dominion of our world consisting of all the governments now established among mankind would be thrown into anarchy tumultuation and blood while one daring successful tyranny would overspread the face of the whole earth and swallow up his providential and gradually evolving plans of future peace virtue and happiness the analogy cannot be broken without breaking the entire chain of nature and things  chaste and enlightened ideas of our specific situation as subjects of god who not only reigns over us with a jealous anxiety about the performance of our duty to him but who created us also must always be our rule of conduct when contemplating ourselves the subjects of an earthly prince who under god equally his king as ours has no farther right to claim subjection from us if at any time clashing with our subjection to god the higher power than a viceroy or ambassador has to claim subjection manifestly and of right only claimable by him they represent the analogy stands upon impregnable ground  implicit unexaminable submission to kings and governors i really excellent by taking their line of administration from god the supreme king and governor might be safely acquiesced in and submitted to but when or where has the world hitherto found when or where shall the world in future find such prodigies  a strange phenomenon  a blackbird white owls basking joyous in the blaze of light extraordnaries indeed  soot changed from black and down and plumage on a hedgehogs back an excellent king would be one of the most mavelous spectacles upon earth as temptations nearly infinite and almost invincible solicit him on all hands to be the very reverse a bad king is as consequentially to be expected as that frail fragile mortals will generally give way to the seductions of power pleasure voluptuousness and flattery perhaps half a million of kings have reigned in the various parts of the earth of whom it may not uncharitably be said that scarce a thousand have been truly excellent this disproportion is immense but not more immense than within the boundaries of fair calculation let it be remembered that our term of calculational comparison is  truly excellent and if not truly excellent there certainly lies an appeal from all kings let their extrinsic glory majesty and terror be what they may to a higher power not barely in truth excellent but the most excellent every individual is judge of this appeal if the conviction of its necessity and rectitude should expose him to present pains and amercements he has that indemnification in his own bosom which no tyrant or arbitrary court can take away because they can neither see it nor feel it as an object of envy jealousy or appetency and even should it expose him to the loss of life still the loss of life would be an acquisition compared with the loss of conscience not to mention that the loss of life would but the sooner send him to that tribunal and to that judge who instituted the appeal and will impartially hear it  upon the above principles colonies have an heavenimparted right prior and paramount to all charters to become empires when they can that is in consequence of internal exertion and industry without invading the home property and imperial immunities of other countries or kingdoms this inference is also obvious that to contravene and impede them under any pretext whatsoever in their progress from the nonage to the fullage of empire would be the same thing as to lay the impious hand of despotism on arts and science on virtue and industry on agriculture and manufactures on trade and commerce the eventual unfoldings of the human mind divine the diversified operations of genius and the understanding the unavoidable spontaneous result of all which in the course and issue of things is  dominion empire independence in consequence of these the creation of god instead of being rude and untrodden a wild and howling wilderness becomes a second time the garden of eden and a prelude to the grand final reintegration of nature let these be confined to one spot one island or one continent the restoration of things would never happen three parts out of four of our earth would be a dreary unhospitable region not fit for a sunburned indian to make his way through instead of a god to revisit and the greatest proportion of mankind be wretched slaves or more wretched sycophants but when god revisits our earth in any special manifestation of himself it will not be to cast his eye around on slaves but to reign among freemen and not to behold monarchs raised as a sort of rivalgods above subjects but to behold them levelled with subjects and all alike his subjects  to stop the course of colonization therefore toward independence is to supercede the decrees of heaven and obstruct the necessary evolutions of divine providence all empires and kingdoms degenerate into tyranny tyranny is the plethoric disease of states as the gout or jaundice is of corpulency the last state upon earth must be absolutely and perfectly free because the remove from that to heaven will be immediate it is a counteraction then of the sublime revolutionary scheme of heaven to prevent the progress of infant colonies and states when we are not actually attacked in our property at home which justly speaking is a nations only rightful property every thing else being the effect and acquisition of conquest violent possession barbarity rapine and blood nor can i help deploring that great britain is now effectually punished by an invisible hand through the medium of that very continent which she unjustifiably took possession of at first from the unoffending native inhabitants who had as good a claim of property to that western continent as we to any part of the northern  this will be called superstition perhaps yet i am no moravian or methodist no high or low churchman no puritan or seceder but in short a simple believer without having confessed or articled myself to any sect so that no sect or party need be at the trouble to assume the honor of me or throw off the discredit of me i have never broken the peace nor ever will while in my wits and senses i love my country and king and assist both with my purse whenever they have any legitimate demand upon it and should they ever be involved in the defense of true liberty whether religious or civil with foreign assailants i will reckon my life as taxable as my purse yet notwithstanding all this professionary detail i cannot suppress my sentiments on american affairs cannot help thinking we are wrong kicking against the pricks and fighting against god in so far as we would destroy the freedom and property of a great people placed in a distant quarter of the world and hastening fast under the eye of an auspicious providence to political maturity and hardihood whom we would ignobly depress and retard in their shooting out into the vigor of a free and independent government because we have abused and adulterated true government ourselves stretching our depredations and massacres not only to the eastern but western world as if the supreme lord of the world by whom kings reign and princes decree justice will not avenge blood the blood of thousands and ten thousands under whatever pretense shed short of actual selfpreservation were the asiatic or the north american indians insulting our borders or pirating on our coasts no their ignorance of navigation secured them from the guilt of murder and robbery in ten thousand instances now crying aloud for vengeance on the head of great britain  put up thy sword into its sheath for they that take the sword shall perish by the sword  vengeance is mine and i will repay it says the lord  scripture to my lord norths or my lord mansfields nerve of hearing will be quite unparliamentary unforensic and untechnical but  scripture is the politics of heaven nor can i suppose with all their courtly refinement and breeding that any noble lords in administration will take upon them to aver that the politics of st jamess are the politics of heaven if not let them then refrain from palming their intolerant plans of taxational policy on distant latitudes and regions that positively will not accept of them because they cannot as freemen born and trustees accountable to posterity unless by force violence and bloodshed overpowered by numbers and reduced to slavery in which depressed degraded state they should seem little worth the acceptance of a great generous virtuous and pious monarch to rule over slaves is the spirit and ambition of satan who views a freeman with the same contorted countenance and squinteyed malignity that he would view an angel from heaven  let then our highprerogative senators our boastful asserters of supreme legislation be told that to deny colonies the freedom they themselves enjoy without deserving it better is a colossian stride toward defpotism the disgrace of manhood and the degradation of our species beside being such an overexertion of authority as a parent would be justly condemnable for who would attempt to overruled his childrens freeagency after they had come of age that is been accounted competent by the laws of god and man to will and act for themselves  many people affecting to be thought sensible and knowing shrewdly remark that the americans have begun a century too soon to set up the standard of independence such shrewd remarkers must suppose that right and justice have a growth a state of unripeness and maturity like animals and vegetables and that actions essentially criminal now will not be so an hundred years hence in other words what is actual rebellion now will in a few generations become heroic spirit and virtuous magnanimity by the same process of reasoning white will become black in due time and snow hot a courtier honest and a playactor shamefaced opinions manners fashions change with times the cast of virtues and the cast of crimes but honesty gods image in the soul changes but with the needle and the pole so uncomprehensive a knowledge of things so shallow an acquaintance with the history of nations the progress of society and origin of government would seem scarcely worth recital much less an elaborate refutation remarks indeed of this kind are generally in the mouth of men that enjoy emoluments under the crown but who would wish to have the appearance of candor and moderation i e hug their filthy lucre at the same time that they would not be thought seduced from truth and integrity by filthy lucre the duplicity every mortal perceives but themselves  it is truly a laughable circumstance in a serious affair that great britain should first qualify and enable the colonies to do for themselves independent of the parent that begat them and then cry out on their undutifulness and ingratitude for acting in this line of qualification and capacity should a father give his son a patrimony or capital to carry on the business or trade he had instructed him in and afterward reprimand and punish him for disobedience because he made use of that very capital and applied himself effectually to business what might we think of such a father the answer to the question involves the deepest crimination of the present ministry the charge of ingratitude lies not at the door of the colonies but the charge of inconsistency and preposterous conduct lies at the door of the premier and his conclave speaking in the name of great britain but like many other interpreters speaking interestedly arbitrarily and deceitfully  providence has great and important revolutions to bring about in the world before it become what we are assured by the prophetic spirit it must become before the termination of all things god originally was the only acknowledged king among mankind but as soon as vice wickedness and idolatry began to prevail men in different societies and dynasties appointed kings for themselves god continuing to be their king by the embassadorial medium of teachers and prophets would have been a constant troublesome admonitory check on their enormities an awful living evidence against them resolved therefore upon immorality and the grossest corruptions they agreed to emancipate themselves from heaven and choose kings and rulers that they well knew would be as immoral and corrupt as themselves nay in many instances take the lead in every abomination the jewish nation was one remarkable instance of this we have it upon the most authentic record while they preserved primaeval innocence and simplicity they rejoiced and were blessed in their theocratic polity but when they became debased and polluted by the heathen nations around and captivated with their vain kingly pageantry they boldly and riotously demanded an earthly king from samuel the messenger of heaven as they themselves express it that we may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles the degeneracy of the jews and their lust after a visible temporal king in imitation of the pagan world commenced together which demonstrates a degree of analogy between kingly domination and the unrestrained practice of private vice and corruption not to be resisted as immediate communications with heaven would always have had the effect of controuling base and unworthy passions therefore so soon as mankind wished freely to indulge them they were restless and unhappy till that communication was cut off since that fatal and degrading epoch things have continued in the channel of licentiousness and debauchery to this day courts generally speaking are the center and licensed purlieus of corruption vice and immorality with a gauzethin decorum and breeding indeed that would gild and varnish the want of virtue and integrity but things will not cannot last long in this retrograde path of reformation and moral improvement as the world first began with the theocratic form of government it will certainly also end with it how far soever we really are at present from it kings and kingdoms are opposing and counteracting one another while they all alike wallow in the foulest vices and crimes thus in the end they will destroy one another or be destroyed by formidable evils from heaven till the insuperable necessity shall stare men in the face of recurring to the first institution of all theocracy in the mean time fitting themselves for it by the practice of moral virtues and piety toward god  before this glorious and happy renovation however can take place mankind must have the most generous pure and exquisite conceptions of liberty quite the reverse of what it is at this ignominious day throughout the world if we except those critical unparalleled and astonishing struggles in one great continental division of it god cannot act sentimentally in arbitrary governments or among slaves till he first work a miracle by instantaneously changing mens minds such instruments would never push forward schemes destructive of themselves which all schemes of manly freedom virtuous independence and moral selfdenial would be nor can a thorough reformation of manners and principles take place in any state where a political establishment of religion subsists because such a reformation would be an act of dissent and nonconformity altogether subversive of that establishment besides in all national establishments the showy appearance of duty pompous rites and ceremonies take off from mens reverence for the reality nay actually supercede it in nine hundred and ninety instances of a thousand when we have proved to our fellow creatures that we are religious by going to the same place of public worship and uttering over and over the same responses with them we seldom think of any thing farther i keep my neighbor in countenance and my neighbor keeps me over and above that my neighbor is always before my eyes but god is invisible great britain and ireland therefore with sorrow and pain i make the observation can never be made instrumental to bring about those grand political restorations and religious reforms which some time or another certainly must happen should they ever be effected in these kingdoms it must be through the medium of persons unconnected by corruption with the court and by creeds with a national hierarchy courts and hierarchies swear and take bribes to preserve inviolate their respective institutions how then can they be made instruments to perjure themselves and save highwaymen the trouble by picking their own pockets moreover truth requires no forms of adjuration among its friends nor virtue any undue influence to be used to insure its practice heaven is not reduced to such pitiful shifts  there are now two great quarters of the globe occupied by christian freemen many of them britons or the descendants of britons undebauched by a corrupt and vicious court and unembarrassed by a religious establishment i mean our commercial territory in the east indies and the vast western continent of america especially the latter great mighty and illustrious things may be expected from america where men have not sworn and subscribed to one another to limit their municipal and religious knowledge consequently are open and unengaged for the inspirations of heaven the manly exertions of generous enterprise and the illimitable extensions of improvement on every object of literary discussion and scientific research there unoccupied territorial boundlessness furnished with every thing nature can produce or art require except gold and silver mines the pandemonium of states affords infinite resources to a bold free brave spirited ingenious quicksighted adventuring people a people undebased by hereditary subjection to civil or religious tyrants haughty pampered statesmen or bishops no less haughty and pampered blessed situation enviable clime  such would seem a theater somewhat worthy a divine being to act upon and not an insular corner of the earth possessed by a people quite corpulent and diseased with luxury  corrupted and debauched by their nobles and gentry their corrupters and debauchers themselves abandoned to gamingtables and horseraces and prostituted to masquerades and brothels  their parliaments pinned to the ministers sleeve and their elections carried on by perjury and asiatic gold  an insular nook  where the inhabitants have not elbowroom without emigrating by thousands to distant shores nor their consciences fair play but through the tolerating grace and favor of spiritual lorders over the heritage of god my lords the bishops  where art has got the better of innocence and hypocrisy of virtue  and where every thing sells at an high marketable price but  wisdom and integrity  from this glorious continent doubtless in due time civil and religious liberty light and knowledge will spread over all the nations of the world now mostly merged in disgraceful slavery groaning under royal despots the curse of their species or kissing the obscene toes of insolent timeserving ecclesiastics  such an infinity of human beings seeming content and happy in their worse than bestial servitude is no proof of their being so in many cases their torpid acquiescence and insensibility is an aggravation or rather the emphasis of their misery the dead signposts of their bondage the antesepulchral escutcheons of their unutterable wretchedness  whether the period is now that america shall stand forth high and respectable on the scale of nations or an hundred years hence it matters not nor does it affect our general argument whenever it happens great britain must yield the palm of empire and whether she yields it now or a century hence is a point of no material consequence to a true patriotic philosopher or philosophical briton who would aspire to have a standard beyond times and seasons  one thing however cannot escape present animadversion lest providence should mistake the proper crisis to call forth the americans to empire and independence lord n and his conclave have thought it meet to push them to the grand eclaircissement by anticipation backed by his myrmidons of the quill dalrymple shebbeare tucker johnson not forgetting his lordships goosefeather champion the rev john wesley m a that excellent philosopher critic and politician lord kaims has discovered so sagacious and prophetic a spirit with regard to america in his sketches of the history of man article progress of states that i cannot resist the temptation of inserting it here it was probably composed before our troubles began our northamerican colonies are in a prosperous condition increasing rapidly in population and opulence the colonies have the spirit of a free people and are inflamed with patriotism their population will equal that of britain and ireland in less than a century and they will then be a match for the mother country if they choose to be independent every advantage will be on their side as the attack must be by sea from a very great distance sketches of the history of man article progress of states book ii sketch iv   in truth our dispute with the colonies seems to be a quarrel of the ministers from official pique resentment and mortification rather than a war upon noble manly equitable principles and however it may cast up on the wheel of contingencies the disinvolution of which often times depend on mediums of discernment and tests of scrutiny seldom within the reach of mortals though the events of war have hitherto been mostly in favor of the americans the minister can never descend to his grave in peace should he not have previously made it up with his god for fashions sake we will suppose a prime minister acknowledges a god for the slaughter of his creatures the robbery of their possessions and the destruction of their habitations  the casting vote of parliament or a privy council nay even the approbatory smile of his sovereign will not cannot acquit him at the tribunal of his maker perhaps not far off for want only and vindictively imbruing his hands in the blood of fellow men  not merely fellow men but fellow christians  not merely fellow christians but fellow protestants  for what  because the descendants of britons would not prove themselves less than britons or unworthy of the name by submitting to be amerced and dragooned like slaves into subjection unmindful of their parentage and unconscious of the image of god freedom in their foreheads  it may likewise be remarked here that kings however at present surrounded with sycophants and flatterers pledging themselves he is right whose reigns have been marked with superserviceable war and stained with unnecessary blood the blood of their equals in every respect except a crown which the most worthless and abandoned oftentimes wear generally die unlamented and are seldom recalled to mind by posterity a discerning impartial equitable because an uncloseted and unpensioned posterity but to be execrated  vice weakness folly first seduced mankind body alas triumphant over the mind to choose that thing of pageantry and straw we call a king laws guardian without law when good kings more than humanly excel bad  are the representatives of  hell all the palladiums of the state seem to be giving way one by one insomuch that very soon it will have nothing to exhibit but the effigies or mummy of what it once has been the dead lion kicked and insulted by every longeared animal passing by of a particular species that knows to trudge on humble and submiss in the trammels of a minister or hold up its obscene mouth in the house to bray for a pension  a system of corruption has pervaded the entire body politic as certainly to consume and destroy it as a putrifactive taint the human circulating with its juices and debilitating its solids from the premier to the meanest clerk in office from the court at st jamess down to the poorest country village the fatal infection prevails and diffuses itself the first minister and confidant of royalty bribed for his talents and oratory and the fortyshilling freeholder bribed for his vote at elections a constitution thus supported in opposition to the faith truth and integrity of things which amounts to a defiance of heaven cannot last long and really the sooner it comes to an end provided its internal powers of restoration and reform are sunk beyond hope and expectation whatever may be the previous convulsion the better infinitely god the patron of virtue probity and rectitude not only authorizes the total destruction of such a system but will likewise propitiate and guarantee the renovation even our world put on its present beauteous and glorious form in consequence of a chaos nor would the deluvian period ever have happened but as a remedy for the irrecoverable wickedness and depravity of mankind before the flood the power that made and has all a long sustained a constitution if in the hands of unfaithful and arbitrary governors it counteracts its original purposes and has a certain unequivocal tendency to overthrow the personal freedom of the subject for the guardianship of which it was alone conceived and elaborated such a power i say may and ought to unmake and break it to pieces in order to throw the materials into a more perfect mold to produce a more perfect impression the people the aggregate powergiving body of the state are the almighty and unresponsible cause here alluded to as alone adequate to such an effect  a political constitution is like a clock or a watch as being of artificial structure and durability without any imputable guilt or feeling of remorse the artist takes the latter machinery asunder when the wheels and springs have been obstructed or worn down beyond repair and substitutes new in their place the former piece of machinery though of the highest order of human device and fabrication must likewise be taken asunder as often as its defects become irreparable and its wastes unsuppliable neither is there delinquency or any cause for compunction in the one case more than the other indeed as they differ preeminently in excellence and value the care the accurate inspection the delicate demur the deliberative matureness of final judgment should in an equal degree be preeminent respecting the one instance above the other by the unquestionable analogy between the first and the last staring them in the face in all free states the executive servants of government the official members of the empire are kept in order and long effectually prevented from running into the excesses of tyranny and aristocraticism the whole position is rational and perfectly consistent with itself  kings and statesmen without the people to feed clothe and defend them should be nothing more reputable or stable in their high situations than corks blown about by the winds on the surface of the waters or buoys cut away from their anchors kings and ministers of state while they so unaccountably idolize themselves and accept of idolatry from all around them the abject homage paid them deserves no other name think not of the above humiliating circumstance which reduces them from their receptoffices of incense to the butterfly deprived of his wings or the master be disarmed of his sting  the elected representative magistratical departments of society have presumed so extravagantly on their derived and adventitious greatness have taken such gigantic strides in office toward despotism that they must indeed be brought to their proper level prostrate in submission at the footstool of their creators  the people  by the people i would not be understood to mean a riotous mob a tumult at the marketcross or a county insurrection from which at all times good god deliver us but the honorable and respectable yeomanry of the realm the middle class of citizens and country gentry whose wealth in the gross is the principal wealth of the nation and support of government and whose education principles studies and manners qualify and entitle them to direct the lowest orders of society and control the highest should these to any dangerous length exceed their delegated trust or those discover a forwardness to rush into hasty association and violent insurgency  nothing can be a stronger proof of our degeneracy infatuation and ripeness for some revolution that will severely punish while it brings us to our senses and reforms us than two considerations which shall now be mentioned with brevity but pointedness while the british empire is in the state of being rent like a garment from top to bottom while british glory has been brought under a total eclipse and british honor passes as a problem among the nations the sons of britain in a diseased trance of ignoble ambition are soliciting and procuring vain empty titles from the crown which in the absence of virtue are no more than the colors flying of a ship after its hulk has been eaten through and through with worms or her rudder cables and anchors lost in a storm the m  o  t  t after having brought his own into dispute and endangered the real honor of the nation by grasping at too much power and dominion and set one part of his sub  to rob and murder the other consoles himself with throwing away fictitious nominal honors the disposal of which was lodged with him by the people for a quite different purpose on men whose only merit consists in humouring and flattering him in par  s and priv  coun  s this consideration at once serves to point out the political disease of the times and its apparent eventual termination the other is this in the above recited melancholy situation of public affairs our nobles and gentry instead of being roused to selfreformation and hereby the only possible method recommending the fleets and armies of britain to the protection and blessing of heaven are hurrying into every scene of vice folly dissipation and debauchery horseraces cockfights gambling tables masquerades pantomimes farces and stews while the public teachers of the land the clergy either look on with total unconcern or actually partake themselves of such illtimed pleasures and amusements the lawnsleeve bishop and his powdered chaplain equally lost to a sense of honor and duty this is a fact notorious to every eye and in the face of the sun calls upon heaven to punish us as a nation and people god however brings good out of evil he has made us instruments to render a great continent wise at our expense to check the inhabitants in their career of luxury and recall them to the almost deserted paths of piety and virtue and hereby opened an immense future asylum for the good of all nations the distressed and persecuted of all regions  it is acknowledged in the midst of this black and dismal prospect the colonies defending themselves in a state of formidable revolt and france and spain ready to take advantage of our blundering and distracted councils our wretched national nakedness and imbecility that the fashionable routine of public worship like most other fashions on sundays and holidays goes regularly on but alas in this respect we are no better than the jews were of old scribes and pharisees hypocrites when christ delivered this prediction which was afterward literally accomplished master fee what manner of stones and what buildings are here jesus said unto him see thou those great buildings our cathedrals and churches there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down  it is likewise acknowledged that we have had a public fast day appointed by authority for great britain and ireland the priv  coun  of e  obliged though fomewhat unbecomely late to follow the example of the americans without the pure piety and virtuous patriotism of these determined continentalists but almighty god has condemned and reprobated for ever all such deceitful hypocritical service the mere flourish of ambitious temporizing ecclesiastics imposing on the facile unexamining spirit of their s  the mere rant of a party the mere hueandcry of a mercenary political establishment here follow the words of inspiration which ought to strike all k  s priv  coun  s proclam  s right and most rev bishops dumb for ever behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard in high is it such a fast as i have chosen  a day for a man to afflict his soul  is to bow down his head as a bullrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him  is not this the fast that i have chosen  to loose the bands of wickedness  to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke  to conclude the whole  however unfashionable unpopular and uncourtly the introduction of scripture into a political tract i cannot help transcribing here another striking passage from the most venerable book in the world from which it appears that the ordinary business of life going on in its accustomed progressive channel added to the most soothing and flattering ideas of homesecurity instead of forming a barrier against overwhelming general calamities rather tend to create suspicions of their approach when a nation has lost its internal character of integrity temperance truth virtue justice and clemency notwithstanding our present seeming tranquillity and safety in great britain and ireland it is certain that the effort toward overturning the principles of our once happy and envied constitution has been made the stroke of despotism struck in america  the americans are britons by descent as well as we in spirit our equals in genuine patriotism our superiors every article of freedom we enjoy they have an equal right to enjoy therefore ministerial oppression exerting itself there is the same thing with regard to the safety and stability of the empire at large as if it had been exerted here tyranny failing in its attempts on the other side the atlantic we shall be safe at home should it however succeed we shall as surely be undone with the satisfaction indeed the exquisite satisfaction of being the last indulgently that shall be devoured by the hideous monster  but what an act of folly and madness not to be alarmed when our neighbors house is on fire because the flames have not as yet catched hold of our own  these are the words of a personage above all kings and legislators whatsoever  they did eat they drank  they married wives  they were given in marriage  until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat  they drank  they bought  they sold  they planted  they builded  but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all  finis
