approved and praised unenvied by the muse he loved a pope  dialogues upon the usefulness of ancient medals dialogue i cynthio eugenius and philander had retired together from the town to a country village that lies upon the thames their design was to pass away the heats of the summer among the fresh breezes that rise from the river d the agreeable mixture of shades and fountains  which the whole country naturally abounds hey were all three very well versed in the poer parts of learning and had traveled into the ost refined nations of europe so that they ere capable of entertaining themselves on a thousand different subjects without running into the common topics of defaming public parties or particular persons as they were intimate friends they took the freedom to dissent from one another in discourse or upon occasion to speak a latin sentence without fearing the imputation of pedantry or illbreeding  they were one evening taking a walk together in the fields when their discourse accidentally fell upon several unprofitable parts of learning it was cynthios humor to run down every thing that was rather for ostentation than use he was still preferring good sense to arts and sciences and often took a pleasure to appear ignorant that he might the better turn to ridicule those that valued themselves on their books and studies though at the same time one might very well see that he could not have attacked many parts of learning so successfully had not he borrowed his assistances from them after having rallied a set or two of virtuosos he fell upon the medallists  these gentlemen says he value themselves upon being critics in rust and will undertake to tell you the different ages of it by its color they are possessed with a kind of learned avarice and are for getting together hoards of such money only as was current among the greeks and latins there are several of them that are better acquainted with the faces of the antonines than of the stuarts and would rather choose to count out a sum in sesterces than in pounds sterling i have heard of one in italy that used to swear by the head of otho nothing can be pleasanter than to see a circle of these virtuosos about a cabinet of medals descanting upon the value rarity and authenticalness of the several pieces that lie before them one takes up a coin of gold and after having well weighed the figures and inscription ells you very gravely if it were brass it would be invaluable another falls a ringing a pescenius niger and judiciously distinguishes the ound of it to be modern a third desires you o observe well the toga on such a reverse and asks you whether you can in conscience believe the sleeve of it to be of the true roman cut  i must confess says philander the knowledge of medals has most of those disadvantages that can ender a science ridiculous to such as are not well versed in it nothing is more easy than to represent as impertinences any parts of learning that have no immediate relation to the happiness or convenience of mankind when a man spends his whole life among the stars and planets or lays out a twelvemonth on the spots in the sun however noble his speculations may be they are very apt to fall unto burlesque but it is still more natural to augh at such studies as are employed on low and vulgar objects what curious observations have been made on spiders lobsters and cocklehells yet the very naming of them is almost sufficient to turn them into raillery it is no wonder therefore that the science of medals which s charged with so many unconcerning parts of knowledge and built on such mean materials should appear ridiculous to those that have not taen the pains to examine it  eugenius was very attentive to what philander said on the subject of medals he was one that ndeavoured rather to be agreeable than shining in conversation for which reason he was more beloved though not so much admired as cynthio i must confess says he i find my self very much inclined to speak against a sort of study that i know nothing of i have however one strong prejudice in favor of it that philander has thought it worth his while to employ some time upon it i am glad then says cynthio that i have thrown him on a science of which i have long wished to hear the usefulness there says philander you must excuse me at present you do not know but it may have its usefulness but should i endeavor to convince you of it i might fail in my attempt and so render my science still more contemptible on the contrary says cynthio we are already so persuaded of the unprofitableness of your science that you can but leave us where you find us but if you succeed you increase the number of your party well says philander in hopes of making two such considerable proselytes i am very well content to talk away an evening with you on the subject but on this condition that you will communicate your thoughts to me freely when you dissent from me or have any difficulties that you think me capable of removing to make use of the liberty you give us says eugenius i must tell you what i believe surprises all beginners as well as my self we are apt to think your medallists a little fantastical in the different prices they set upon their coins without any regard to the ancient value or the metal of which they are composed a silver medal for example shall be more esteemed than a golden one and a piece of brass than either to answer you says philander it he language of a medallist you are not to look upon a cabinet of medals as a treasure of money but of knowledge nor must you fancy any charms in gold but in the figures and inscriptions at adorn it the intrinsic value of an old coin does not consist in its metal but its erudition it is the device that has raised the species so that at present an as or an obolus may carry a higher price than a denarius or a dram and a piece of money that was not worth a penny fifteen hundred years ago may be now rated at fifty crowns or perhaps a hundred guineas i find says cynthio that to have a relish for ancient coins it is necessary to have a contempt of the modern but i am afraid you will never be able with all your medallic eloquence to persuade eugenius and my self that it is better to have a pocket full of othos and gordians than of jacouss or louis dors this however we shall be judges of when you have let us know the several uses of old coins  the first and most obvious one says philanr is the showing us the faces of all the great persons of antiquity a cabinet of medals is a collection of pictures in miniature juvenal calls them very humorously concisum argentum in titulos faciesque minutas sat   you here see the alexanders caesars pompeys rajans and the whole catalogue of heroes ho have many of them so distinguished themselves from the rest of mankind that we almost ook upon them as another species it is an areeable amusement to compare in our own thoughts the face of a great man with the character that authors have given us of him and to try if we can find out in his looks and features either the haughty cruel or merciful temper that discovers it self in the history of his actions we find too on medals the representations of ladies that have given occasion to whole volumes on the account only of a face we have here the pleasure to examine their looks and dresses and to survey at leisure those beauties that have sometimes been the happiness or misery of whole kingdoms nor do you only meet the faces of such as are famous in history but of several whose names are not to be found any where except on medals some of the emperors for example have had wives and some of them children that no authors have mentioned we are therefore obliged to the study of coins for having made new discoveries to the learned and given them information of such persons as are to be met with on no other kind of records you must give me leave says cynthio to reject this last use of medals i do not think it worth while to trouble my self with a persons name or face that receives all his reputation from the mint and would never have been known in the world had there not been such things as medals a mans memory finds sufficient employment on such as have really signalized themselves by their great actions without charging it self with the names of an insignificant people whose whole history is written on the edges of an old coin  if you are only for such persons as have made a noise in the world says philander you have on medals a long list of heathen deities distinguishd from each other by their proper titles and oraments you see the copies of several statues that have had the politest nations of the world fll down before them you have here too sevel persons of a more thin and shadowy nature s hope constancy fidelity abundance hoour virtue eternity justice moderation hapiness and in short a whole creation of the like maginary substances to these you may add the genies of nations provinces cities highways and the like allegorical beings in devices of this nature one sees a pretty poetical invention and may often find as much thought on the reverse of a medal as in a canto of spenser not to interrupt you says eugenius i fancy it is this use of medals that has recommended them to several historypainters who perhaps without this assistance would have found it very difficult to have invented such an airy species of beings when they are obliged to put a moral virtue into colors or to find out a proper dress for a passion i is doubtless for this reason says philander that painters have not a little contributed to bring the udy of medals in vogue for not to mention several others caraccio is said to have assisted aetine by designs that he took from the spintriae of tiberius raphael had thoroughly studied the figures on old coins patin tells us that lo run had done the same and it is well known at rubens had a noble collection of medals in his wn possession but i must not quit this head before i tell you that you see on medals not only the names and persons of emperors kings consuls proconsuls praetors and the like chaacters of importance but of some of the poets and of several who had won the prizes at the olympic games it was a noble time says cynthio when trips and cornish hugs could make a man immortal how many heroes would moorfields have furnished out in the days of old a fellow that can now only win a hat or a belt had he lived among the greeks might have had his face stamped upon their coins but these were the wise ancients who had more esteem for a milo than a homer and heapt up greater honors on pindars jockies than on the poet himself but by this time i suppose you have drawn up all your medallic people and indeed they make a much more formidable body than i could have imagined you have shown us all conditions sexes and ages emperors and empresses men and children gods and wrestlers nay you have conjured up persons that exist no where else but on old coins and have made our passions and virtues and vices visible i could never have thought that a cabinet of medals had been so well peopled but in the next place says philander as we see on coins the different faces of persons we see on them too their different habits and dresses according to the mode that prevailed in the several ages when the medals were stamped this is another use says cynthio that in my opinion contributes rather to make a man learned than wise and is neither capable of pleasing the understanding or imagination i know there are several supercilious critics that will treat an author with the greatest contempt imaginable if he fancies the old romans wore a girdle and are amazed at a mans ignorance who believes the toga had any sleeves to it till the declension of the roman empire now i would fain know the great importance of this kind of learning and why it should not be as noble a task to write upon a bib and hangingsleeves as on the bulla and praetexta the reason is that we are familiar with the names of the one and meet with the other no where but in learned authors an antiquary will scorn to mention a pinner or a nightrail a petticoat or a manteau but will talk as gravely as a father of the church on the vitta and peplus the stola and instita how would an old roman laugh were it possible for him to see the solemn dissertations that have been made on these weighty subjects to set them in their natural light let us fancy if you please that about a thousand years hence some profound author shall write a learned treatise on the habit of the present age distinguished into the following titles and chapters of the old british trowser of the ruff and collarbana the opinion of several learned me concerning the use of the shoulderknot such a one mistaken in his account of the surtout etc i must confess says eugenius interrupting him the knowledge of these affairs is in it self very lite improving but as it is impossible without it to understand several parts of your ancient authors it certainly has its use it is pity indeed there is not a nearer way of coming at it i have sometimes fancied it would not be an impertinent design to make a kind of an old roman wardrobe where you should see togas and tunicas the chlamys and trabea and in short all the different vests and ornaments that are so often mentioned in the greek and roman authors by this means a man would comprehend better and remember much longer the shape of an ancient garment than he possibly can from the help of tedious quotations and descriptions the design says philander might be very useful but after what models would you work sigonius for example will tell you that the vestis trabeat was of such a particular fashion scaliger is for another and dacier thinks them both in the wrong these are says cynthio i suppose the names of three roman tailors for is it possible men of learning can have any disputes of this nature may not we as well believe that hereafter the whole learned world will be divided upon the make of a modern pair of breeches and yet says eugenius the critics have fallen as fou upon each other for matters of the same moment but as to this point where the make of the garment is controverted let them if they can find cloth enough work after all the most probable fashions to enlarge the design i would have another room for the old roman instruments o war where you might see the pilum and the shield the eagles ensigns helmets batteringrams and trophies in a word all the ancient military furniture in the same manner as it might have been in an arsenal of old rome a third apartment should be a kind of sacristie for altars idols sacrificing instruments and other religious utensils not to be tedious one might make a magazine for all sorts of antiquities that would show a man in an afternoon more than he could earn out of books in a twelvemonth this would ut short the whole study of antiquities and perhaps  much more useful to universities than those ollections of whalebone and crocodileskins in which they commonly abound you will find it very difficult says cynthio to persuade those societies of learned men to fall in with your project they will tell you that things of this importance must not be taken on trust you ought to learn them among the classic authors and at the fountainhead pray consider what a figure a man would make in the republic of letters should he appeal to your universitywardrobe when they expect a sentence out of the re vestiaria or how do you think a man that has read vegetius will relish your roman arsenal in the mean time says philander you find on medals every thing that you could meet with in your magazine of antiquities and when you have built your arsenals wardrobes and sacristies it is from medals that you must fetch their furniture it is here too that you see the figures of several instruments of music mathematics and mechanics one might make an entire gally out of the plans that are to be met with on the reverses of several old coins nor are they only charged with things but with many ancient customs as sacrifices triumphs congiaries allocutions decursions lectierniums and a thousand other antiquated names d ceremonies that we should not have had so jst a notion of were they not still preserved on coins i might add under this head of antiquities that we find on medals the manner of spelng in the old roman inscriptions that is says cynthio we find that felix is never written with an oe dipthongue and that in augustuss days civis stood for cives with other secrets in orthography of the same importance  to come then to a more weighty use says philander it is certain that medals give a very great light to history in confirming such passages as are true in old authors in settling such as are told after different manners and in recording such as have been omitted in this case a cabinet of medals is a body of history it was indeed the best way in the world to perpetuate the memory of great actions thus to coin out the life of an emperor and to put every great exploit into the mint it was a kind of printing before the art was invented it is by this means that monsieur vaillant has disembroiled a history that was lost to the world before his time and out of a short collection of medals has given us a chronicle of the kings of syria for this too is an advantage medals have over books that they tell their story much quicker and sum up a whole volume in twenty or thirty reverses they are indeed the best epitomes in the world and let you see with one cast of an eye the substance of above a hundred pages another use of medals is that they not only show you the actions of an emperor but at the same time mark out the year in which they were performed every exploit has its date set to it a series of an emperors coins is his life digested into annals historians seldom break their relation with a mixture of chronology nor distribute the particulars of an emperors story into the several years of his reign or where they do it they often differ in their several periods here therefore it is much safer to quote a medal than an author for in this case ou do not appeal to a suetonius or a lampriius but to the emperor himself or to the whole ody of a roman senate besides that a coin is in no danger of having its characters altered by copiers and transcribers this i must confess says cynthio may in some cases be of great moment but considering the subjects on which your chronologers are generally employed i see but little use that rises from it for example what signifies it to the world whether such an elephant appeared in the amphitheatre in the second or the third year of domitian or what am i the wiser for knowing that trajan was in the fifth year of his tribuneship when he entertained the people with such a horserace or bullbaiting yet it is the fixing of these great periods that gives a man the first rank in the republic of letters and recommends him to the world for a person of various reading and profound erudition  you must always give your men of great reading leave to show their talents on the meanest subjects says eugenius it is a kind of shooting at rovers where a man lets fly his arrow without taking any aim to show his strength but there is one advantage says he turning to philander that seems to me very considerable although your medallists selom throw it into the account which is the great lp to memory one finds in medals for my own part i am very much embarrassed in the names and ranks of the several roman emperors and find it difficult to recollect upon occasion the different parts of their history but your medalsts upon the first naming of an emperor will immediately tell you his age family and life to remember where he enters in the succession they only consider in what part of the cabinet he lies and by runinng over in their thoughts such a particular drawer will give you an account of all the remarkable parts of his reign  i thank you says philander for helping me to an use that perhaps i should not have thought on but there is another of which i am sure you could not be but sensible when you were at rome i must own to you it surprised me to see my ciceroni so well acquainted with the busts and statues of all the great people of antiquity there was not an emperor or empress but he knew by sight and as he was seldom without medals in his pocket he would often show us the same face on an old coin that we saw in the statue he would discover a commodus through the disguise of the club and lions skin and find out such a one to be livia that was dressed up like a ceres let a bust be never so disfigured they have a thousand marks by which to decipher it they will know a zenobia by the sitting of her diadem and will distinguish the faustinas by their different way of tying up their hair oh sir says cynthio they will go a great deal farther they will give you the name and titles of a statue that has lost his nose and ears or if there is but half a beard remaining will tell you at first sight who was the owner of it now i must confess to you i used to fancy they imposed upon me an emperor or empress at pleasure rather than appear ignorant  all this however is easily learnt from medals says philander where you may see likewise the plans of many the most considerable buildings of old rome there is an ingenious gentleman of our own nation extremely well versed in this stud who has a design of publishing the whole history of architecture with its several improvements and decays as it is to be met with on ancient coins he has assured me that he has observed all the nicety of proportion in the figures of the different orders that compose the buildings on the best preserved medals you here see the copies of such ports and triumphal arches as there are not the least traces of in the places where they once stood you have here the models of several ancient temples though the temples themselves and the gods that were worshipped in them are perished many hundred years ago or if there are still any foundations or ruins of former edifices you may learn from coins what was their architecture when they stood whole and entire these are buildings with the goths and vandals could not demolish that are infinitely more durable than stone or marble and will perhaps last as long as the earth it self they are in short so many real monuments of brass  quod non imber edax non aquilo impotens possit diruere aut innumerabilis annorum series and fuga temporum which eating showers nor northwinds feeble blast nor whirle of time nor flight of years can waste mr creech this is a noble panegyric on an old copper coin says cynthio but i am afraid a little malicious rust would demolish one of your braze edifices as effectually as a goth or vandal yo would laugh at me says philander should i mak you a learned dissertation on the nature of rusts i shall only tell you there are two or three sort of them which are extremely beautiful in the ey of an antiquary and preserve a coin better tha the best artificial varnish as for other kinds skilful medallist knows very well how to de with them he will recover you a temple o a triumphal arch out of its rubbish if i may  call it and with a few reparations of the gravin tool restore it to its first splendor and magnifcence i have known an emperor quite hid under a crust of dross who after two or three day cleansing has appeared with all his titles abo him as fresh and beautiful as at his first comi out of the mint i am sorry says eugenius did not know this last use of medals when i w at rome it might perhaps have given me a greater taste of its antiquities and have fixed in m memory several of the ruins that i have now fogotten for my part says cynthio i think the are at rome enough modern works of architectu to employ any reasonable man i never cou have a taste for old bricks and rubbish nor wou trouble my self about the ruins of augustuss place so long as i could see the vatican t borghese and the farnese as they now stand must own to you at the same time this is talki like an ignorant man were i in other compny i would perhaps change my style and t them that i would rather see the fragments  apollos temple than st peters i rememb when our antiquary at rome had led us a who day together from one ruin to another he at last brought us to the rotunda and this says he is the most valuable antiquity in italy notwithstanding it is so entire  the same kind of fancy says philander has formerly gained upon several of your medallists who were for hoording up such pieces of money only as had been half consumed by time or rust there were no coins pleased them more than those which had passed through the hands of an old roman clipper i have read an author of this taste that compares a ragged coin to a tattered colors but to come again to our subject as we find on medals the plans of several buildings that are now demolished we see on them too the models of many ancient statues that are now lost there are several reverses which are owned to be the representations of antique figures and i question not but there are many others that were formed on the like models though at present they lie under no suspicion of it the hercles farnese the venus of medicis the apollo in the belvidera and the famous marcus aurelius on horseback which are perhaps the four most beautiful statues extant make their appearance all of them on ancient medals though the figures that represent them were never thought to be the pies of statues till the statues themselves were discovered there is no question i think but t same reflection may extend it self to antique pctures for i doubt not but in the designs of several greek medals in particular one might often see the hand of an apelles or protogenes were we as well acquainted with their works as e are with titians or vandikes i might here make a much greater show of the usefulness of medals if i would take the method of others and prove to you that all arts and sciences receive a considerable illustration from this study i must however tell you that medals and the civil law as we are assured by those who are well read in both give a considerable light to each other and that several old coins are like so many maps for explaining of the ancient geography but besides the more solid parts of learning there are severa little intimations to be met with on medals tha are very pleasant to such as are conversant in thi kind of study should i tell you gravely tha without the help of coins we should never have known which was the first of the emperors tha wore a beard or rode in stirrups i might turt my science into ridicule yet it is certai there are a thousand little impertinencies of this nature that are very gratifying to curiosity though perhaps not very improving to the understanding to see the dress that such an empress delighte to be drawn in the titles that were most agreeabl to such an emperor the flatteries that he lay mo open to the honors that he paid to his chidren wives predecessors friends or colleague with the like particularities only to be met with o medals are certainly not a little pleasing to the inquisitive temper which is so natural to the min of man  i declare to you says cynthio you have astnished me with the several parts of knowledge that you have discovered on medals i cou never fancy before this evening that a coin cou have any nobler use in it than to pay a reckoing  you have not heard all yet says philander there is still an advantage to be drawn from medals which i am sure will heighten your esteem for them it is indeed an use that no body has hitherto dwelt upon if any of the antiquaries have touched upon it they have immediately quitted it without considering it in its full latitude light and extent not to keep you in suspense i think there is a great affinity between coins and poetry and that your medallist and critic are much nearer related than the world generally imagines a reverse often clears up the passage of an old poet as the poet often serves to unriddle a reverse i could be longer on this head but i fear i have already tired you nay says eugenius since you have gone so far with us we must beg you to finish your lecture especially since you are on a subject that i dare promise you will be very agreeable to cynthio who is so professed an admirer of the ancient poets i must only warn you that you do not charge your coins with more uses than they can bear it is generally the method of such as are in love with any particular science to discover all others in it who would imagine for example that architecture should comprehend the knowledge of histoy ethics music astronomy natural philosophy hysic and the civil law yet vitruvius will give ou his reasons such as they are why a good architect is master of these several arts and sciences sure says cynthio martial had never read vitruvius when he threw the crier and the architect into the same class duri si puer ingeni videtur preconem facias vel architectum if of dull parts the stripling you suspect a herald make him or an architect but to give you an instance out of a very celebrated discourse on poetry because we are on that subject of an authors finding out imaginary beauties in his own art i have observed vossius de viribus rythmi says he speaking of the natural propension that all men have to numbers and harmony that my barber ha often combed my head in dactyls an spondees that is with two short strokes and a lon one or with two long ones successively nay say he i have known him sometimes run even into pyrrhichiuss and anapoestuss this you will think perhaps a very extravagant fancy but i mus own i should as soon expect to find the prosodu in a comb as poetry in a medal before i endeavor to convince you of it says philander i mus confess to you that this science has its visionarie as well as all others there are several for example that will find a mystery in every tooth o neptunes trident and are amazed at the wisdom of the ancients that represented a thunderbol with three forks since they will tell you nothing could have better explained its triple quality of piercing burning and melting i have see a long discourse on the figure and nature of horn to show it was impossible to have found out a fitte emblem for plenty than the cornucopiae these a a sort of authors who scorn to take up with appearances and fancy an interpretation vulg when it is natural what could have been more proper to show the beauty and friendship of the three graces than to represent them naked an knitt together in a kind of dance it is thus they always appear in ancient sculpture whether on medals or in marble as i doubt not but horace alludes to designs of this nature when he describes them after the same manner  gratia junctis nuda sororibus  segnesque nodum solvere gratiae the sister graces hand in hand conjoined by loves eternal band several of your medallists will be here again astonished at the wisdom of the ancients that knew how to couch such excellent precepts of morality under visible objects the nature of gratitude they will tell you is better illustrated by this single device than by senecas whole book d beneficiis the three graces teach us three things i to remark the doing of a courtesy ii the return of it from the receiver iii the obligation of the receiver to acknowledge it the three graces are always hand in hand to show us that these three duties should be never separated they are naked to admonish us that gratitude should be returned with a free and open heart and dancing to show us that no virtue is more active than gratitude may not we here say with lucretius quae been and eximie quanquam disposta ferantur sunt long tamen a vera ratione repulsa it is an easy thing says eugenius to find out designs that never entered into the thoughts of the ulptor or the coiner i dare say the same gentlemen who have fixed this piece of morality on the three naked sisters dancing hand in hand would have found out as good a one for them had there been four of them sitting at a distance from each other and covered from head to foot it is here therefore says philander that the old poets step in to the assistance of the medallist when they give us the same though in words as the masters of the roman min have done in figures a man may see a metaphor or an allegory in picture as well as rea them in a description when therefore i confront a medal with a verse i only show yo the same design executed by different hands and appeal from one master to another of the sam age and taste this is certainly a much sure way than to build on the interpretations of a author who does not consider how the ancient used to think but will be still inventing mysteries and applications out of his own fancy t make my self more intelligible i find a shield o the reverse of an emperors coin designed as  compliment to him from the senate of rome meet with the same metaphor in ancient poets t express protection or defense i conclude therefore that this medal compliments the emper in the same sense as the old romans did the dictator fabius when they called him the bucler of rome put this reverse now if you pleas into the hands of a mystical antiquary he sha tell you that the use of the shield being to defen the body from the weapons of an enemy it ver aptly shadows out to us the resolution or cotinence of the emperor which made him pro to all the attacks of fortune or of pleasure  the next place the figure of the shield being round it is an emblem of perfection for aristotle has said the round figure is the most perfect it may likewise signify the immortal reputation that the emperor has acquired by his great actions rotundity being an emblem of eternity that has neither beginning nor end after this i dare not answer for the shields convexity that it does not cover a mystery nay there shall not be the least wrinkle or flourish upon it which will not turn to some account in this case therefore poema est pictura loquax poetry being in some respects an art of designing as well as painting or sculpture they may serve as comments on each other i am very well satisfied says eugenius by what you have said on this subject that the poets may contribute to the explication of such reverses as are purely emblematical or when the persons are of that shadowy allegorical nature you have before mentioned but i suppose there are many other reverses that represent things and persons of a more real existence in this case too says philander a poet lets you into the knowledge of a device better than a prosewriter as his descriptions are often more diffuse his story more naturally circumstanced and his language enriched with a greater variety of epithets so that you often meet with little hints and suggestions in a poet that give a great illustration to the customs actions ornaments and all kinds of antiquities that are to be met with on ancient coins i fancy says cynthio there is nothing more ridiculous than an antiquarys reading the greek or latin poets he never thinks of the beauty of the thought or language but is for searching into what he calls the erudition of the author he will turn you over all virgil to find out the figure of an old rostrum and has the greatest esteem imaginable for homer because has given us the fashion of a greek scepter it is indeed odd enough to consider how all kinds of readers find their account in the old poets not only your men of the more refined or solid parts of learning but even your alchymist and fortune tellers will discover the secrets of their art in homer and virgil this says eugenius is a prejudice of a very ancient standing read but plutarchs discourse on homer and you will see that the iliad contains the whole circle of arts and that thales and pythagoras stole all their philosophy out of this poets works one would be amazed to see what pains he takes to prove that homer understood all the figures in rhetoric before they were invented i do not question says philander were it possible for homer to read his praises in this author but he would be as much surprised as ever monsieur jordain was when he had found he had talked prose all his lifetime without ever knowing what it was but to finish the task you have set me we may observe that not only the virtues and the like imaginary persons but all the heathen divinities appear generally in the same dress among the poets that they wear in medals i must confess i believe both the one and the other took the mode from the ancient greek statuaries it will not perhaps be an improper transition to pass from the heathen gods to the several monsters of antiquity as chimaeras gorgons sphinxes and many others that make the same figure in verse as on coins it often happens too that the poet and the senate of rome have both chosen the same topic to flatter their emperor upon and have sometimes fallen upon the same thought it is certain they both of them lay upon the catch for a great action it is no wonder therefore that they were often engaged on one subject the medal and the poem being nothing else but occasional compliments to the emperor nay i question not but you may sometimes find certain passages among the poets that relate to the parcular device of a medal  i wonder says eugenius that your medallists have not been as diligent in searching the poets as the historians since i find they are so capable of enlightening their art i would have some body put the muses under a kind of contribution to furnish out whatever they have in them that bears any relation to coins though they taught us but the same things that might be learnt in other writings they would at least teach us more agreeably and draw several over to the study of medals that would rather be instructed in verse than in prose i am glad says philander to hear you of this opinion for to tell you truly when i was at rome i took occasion to buy up many imperial medals that have any affinity with passages of the ancient poets so that i have by me a sort of poetical cash which i fancy i could count over to you in latin and greek verse if you will drink a dish of tea with me tomorrow morning i will lay my whole collection before you i cannot tell says cynthio how the poets will succeed in the explication of coins t which they are generally very great strangers we are however obliged to you for preventing us with the offer of a kindness that you might well imagine we should have asked you  our three friends had been so intent on their discourse that they had rambled very far into the fields without taking notice of it philande first put them in mind that unless they turne back quickly they would endanger being benighted their conversation ran insensibly into other subjects but as i design only to report such part of it as have any relation to medals i shall leav them to return home as fast as they please with out troubling my self with their talk on the w thither or with their ceremonies at parting    dialogue ii some of the finest treatises of the most polite latin and greek writers are in dialogue as many very valued pieces of french italian and english appear in the same dress i have sometimes however been very much distasted at this way of writing by reason of the long prefaces and exordiums into which it often betrays an author there is so much time taken up in ceremony that before they enter on their subject the dialogue is half ended to avoid the fault i have found in others i shall not trouble my self nor my reader with the first salutes of our three friends nor with any part of their discourse over the teatable we will suppose the china dishes taken off and a drawer of medals supplying their room philander who is to be the hero in my dialogue takes it in his hand and addressing himself to cynthio and eugenius i will first of all says he show you an assembly of the most virtuous ladies that you have ever perhaps conversed with i do not know says cynthio regarding them what their virtue may be but methinks they are a little fantastical in their dress you will find says philander there is good sense in it they have not a single ornament that they cannot give a reason for i was going to ask you says eugenius in what country you find these ladies but i see they are some of those imaginary persons you told us of last night that inhabit old coins and appear no where else but on the reverse of a medal their proper country says philander is the breast of a good man for i think they are most of them the figures of virtues it is a great compliment methinks to the sex says cynthio that your virtues are generally shown in petticoats i can give no other reason for it says philander but because they chanced to be of the feminine gender in the learned languages first series figure i you find however something bold and masculine in the air and posture of the first figure which is that of virtue her self and agrees very well with the description we find of her in silius italicus virtutis dispar habitus frons hirta nec unquam composita mutata coma stans vultus et ore incessuque viro propior laetique pudoris celsa humeris niveae fulgebat stamine pallae sil it l    a different form did virtue wear rude from her forehead fell the unplaited hair with dauntless mien aloft she reared her head and next to manly was the virgins tread her height her sprightly blush the goddess show and robes unsullied as the falling snow virtue and honor had their temples bordering on each other and are sometimes both on the same coin fig   as in the following one of galba silius italicus makes them companions in the glorious equipage that he gives his virtue virtus loquitur mecum honor et lauds et laeto gloria vultu et decus et niveis victoria concolor alis ibid virtue speaks with me the foremost place let honor gain fame and the praises mingling in her train gay glory next and victory on high white like my self on snowy wings shall fly tu cujus placido posuere in pectore sedem blandus honos hilarisque tamen cum pondere virtus stat sil l   the head of honor is crowned with a laurel as martial has adorned his glory after the same manner which indeed is but another name for the same person mitte coronatas gloria maesta comas i find says cynthio the latins mean courage by the figure of virtue as well as by the word it self courage was esteemed the greatest perfection among them and therefore went under the name of virtue in general as the modern italians give the same name on the same account to the knowledge of curiosities should a roman painter at present draw the picture of virtue inead of the spear and paratonium that she bears n old coins he would give her a bust in one hand and a fiddle in the other  the next says philander fig   is a lady of a more peaceful character and had er temple at rome  salutato crepitat concordia nido she is often placed on the reverse of an imperi coin to show the good understanding betwee the emperor and the empress she has alway a cornucopiae in her hand to denote that plent is the fruit of concord after this short accou of the goddess i desire you will give me you opinion of the deity that is described in the folowing verses of seneca who would have he propitious to the marriage of jason and creus he mentions her by her qualities and not b her name  asperi martis sanguineas quae cohibet manus quae dat belligeris foedera gentibus et cornu retinet divite copiam sen med act   who sooths great mars the warrior god and checks his arm distained with blood who joins in leagues the jarring lands the horn of plenty fills her hands the description says eugenius is a copy of the figure we have before us and for the future in stead of any further note on this passage would have the reverse you have shown us stamped on the side of it the interpreters of seneca says philander will understand the precedent verses as a description of venus though in my opinion there is only the first of them that can aptly relate to her which at the same time agrees as wel with concord and that this was a goddess wh ed to interest her self in marriages we may see the following description   jamdudum post reclinis quaerit hymen thalamis intactum dicere carmen quo vatem mulcere queat dat juno verenda vincula et insigni geminat concordia taeda statii epithalamion silv li   already leaning at the door too long sweet hymen waits to raise the nuptial song her sacred bands majestic juno lends and concord with her flaming torch attends peace differs as little in her dress as in her character from concord fig   you may observe in both these figures that the vest is gathered up before them like an apron which you must suppose filled with fruits as well as the cornucopiae it is to this part of the dress that tibullus alludes at nobis pax alma veni spicamque teneto perfluat et pomis candidus ante sinus kind peace appear and in thy right hand hold the wheaten ear from thy white lap the overflowing fruits shall fall prudentius has given us the same circumstance in his description of avarice  avaritia gremio praecincta capaci prud psychomachia how proper the emblems of plenty are to peace may be seen in the same poet interea pax arva colat pax candida primum duxit araturos subjuga curva boves pax aluit vites et succos condidit uvae funderet ut nato testa paterna merum pace bidens vomerque vigent

medal of heliogabal inscribed fides exercitus that receives a great light from the preceding verses she is posted between two military ensigns for the good quality that the poet ascribes her of preserving the public peace by keeping the army true to its allegiance  i fancy says eugenius as you have discovered the age of this imaginary lady from the description that the poets have made of her you may and too the color of the drapery that she wore in the old roman paintings from that verse in horace te spes et albo rara fides colit velata panno  hor od    lib   sure hope and friendship clothed in white attend on thee  mr creech one would think says philander by this verse that hope and fidelity had both the same kind of dress it is certain hope might have a fair pretense to white in allusion to those that were candidates for an employ  quem ducit hiantem cretata ambitio  pers sat   and how properly the epithet of rara agrees with her you may see in the transparency of the next figure fig   she is here dressed in such a kind of vest as the atins call a multicium from the fineness of its issue your roman beaus had their summer a of such a light airy make quem tenues decuere togae nitidique capilli hor ep    lib   i that loved  curled powdered locks a fine and gaudy gow mr cree i remember says cynthio juvenal rallys crecus that was otherwise a brave rough fellow very

hand for i find your women on medals do nothin without a meaning besides i suppose there a moral precept at least couched under the figur she holds in her other hand she draws bac her garment says philander that it may not in cumber her in her march for she is always drawn in a posture of walking it being as natural for hope to press forward to her proper objects as for fear to fly from them  t canis in vacuo leporem cum gallicus arvo idit et hic praedam pedibus petit ille salutem lter inhaesuro similis jam jamque tenere perat et extento stringit vestigia rostro lter in ambiguo est an sit

more swiftly who was urged by love mr dryden this beautiful similitude is i think the prettiest emblem in the world of hope and fear in extremity a flower or blossom that you see in the right hand is a proper ornament for hope since they are these that we term in poetical language the hopes of the year  ere novo tunc herba nitens et roboris expers urget et insolida est et spe delectat agrestes

of contrary character and therefore in quite different posture as security is free from pursuits she is represented leaning carelessly on pillar horace has drawn a pretty metaphor from this posture  nullum me a labor reclinat otium no ease does lay me down from pain mr cree she rests her self on a pillar for the same reas as the poets often compare an obstinate resoltion or a great firmness of mind to a rock the is not to be moved by all the assaults of win or waves  non civium ardor prava jubentium no vultus instantis tyranni mente quatit solida neque auster dux inquietae turbidus adriae etc the man resolved and steady to his trust inflexible to ill and obstinately just may the rude rabbles insolence despise their senseless clamours and tumultuous cri the tyrants fierceness he beguiles and the stern brow and the harsh voice defies and with superior greatness smiles ot the rough whirlwind that deforms drias black gulf  etc mr creech i am apt to think it was on devices of this nature that horace had his eye in his ode to fortune it is certain he alludes to a pillar that figured out security or something very like it and till any body finds out another that will stand better in s place i think we may content our selves with this before us e dacus asper te profugi scythae rbesque gentesque et latium ferox regumque matres harharorum et purpurei metuunt tyranni

fair as to let you know the peace and felicity have their pillars in sever medals as well as security so that if you do  like one of them you may take the other  fig  0 the next figure is that of

nicely imitated him in this as well as his other beauties but our english libellers are for heng a man downright and for letting him see at istance that he is to look for no mercy i own to you says eugenius i have often admired this piece of art in the two satyrists you mention and have been surprised to meet with a man in satire that i never in the least expected to find there they have a particular way of hiding their ill nature and introduce a criminal rather to illustrate a precept or passage than out of any seeming design to abuse him our english poets on the contrary show a kind of malice prepense in their satires and instead of bringing in the person to give light to any part of the poem let you see they writ the whole poem on purpose to abuse the person but we must not leave the ladies thus pray what kind of headdress is that of piety  as chastity says philander appears in the habit of a roman matron in whom that virtue was supposed to reign in its perfection piety wears the dress of the vestal virgins fig    who were the greatest and most shining examples of it vittata sacerdos is you know an expression among the latin poets i do not question but you have seen in the duke of florences gallery a beautiful antique figure of a woman standing before an altar which some of the antiquaries call a piety and others a vestal virgin the woman altar and fire burning

says cynthio i cannot forbear  marking that of claudius which was the us roman habit one may see in this medal  well as in any antique statues that the old mans had their necks and arms bare and as m exposed to view as our hands and faces are at psent before i had made this remark i ha sometimes wondered to see the roman poe in their descriptions of a beautiful man so often mentioning the turn of his neck and arm that in our modern dresses lie out of sight  are covered under part of the clothing n to trouble you with many quotations hor speaks of both these parts of the body in the begining of an ode that in my opinion may be reconed among the finest of his book for the naralness of the thought and the beauty of the  pression dum tu lydia telephi cervicem roseam et cerea telephi laudas

by jealous heats with numberless resentments beats from my pale cheek the color flies and all the man within me dies it was probably this particular in the roman habit that gave virgil the thought in the following verse where remulus among other reproaches the he makes the trojans for their softness and effeacy upbraids them with the make of their tcas that had sleeves to them and did not leave the arms naked and exposed to the weat like that of the romans t tunicae manicas et habent ridimicula mitrae il lets us know in another place that the ins preserved their old language and habits

with such an impotent kind of revenge as what is the subject of this speech you may be sure says eugenius that virgil knew very well this was a trifling kind of request for the queen of the gods to make as we may find by jupiters way of accepting it olli subridens hominum rerumque repertor et germana jovis saturnique altera proles irarum tantos volvis sub pectore fluctus verum age et inceptum

trojans to their customs shall be tied i will my self their common rites provide the natives shall command the foreigners subside and shall be latium troy without a name and her lost sons forget from whence they came mr dryden i am apt to think virgil had a further view in this request of juno than what his commentators have discovered in it he knew very well that his aeneid was founded on a very doubtful story and that aeneass coming into italy was not universally received among the romans themselves he knew too that a main objection to this story was the great difference of customs language and habits among the romans and trojans to obviate therefore so strong an objection he makes this difference to arise from the forecast and praedetermination of the gods themselves but pray what is the name of the lady in the next medal methinks she is very particular in her quoiffure  fig   it is the emblem of fruitfulness says philander and was designed as a compliment to julia the wife of septimius severus who had the same number of children as you see on this coin her head is crowned with towers in allusion to cybele the mother of the gods and for the same reason that virgil compares

ensigns and is the mark of a roman colony where the medal was stamped by the way you must observe the wherever the romans fixed their standards they looked on that place as their country and thought themselves obliged to defend it with their lives for this reason their standards were always carried before them when they went to settle themselves in a colony this gives the meaning of a couple of verses in silius italicus that make a very farfetcht compliment to fabius  ocyus huc aquilas servataque signa referte hic patria est murique urbis stant pectore in un sil it li   fig    the following medal was stamped on trajans victory over the daci you see on it the figure of trajan presenting a little victory to rome between them lies the conquered province of dacia it may be worth while to observe the particularities in each figure we see abundance of persons on old coins that hold a little victory in one hand like this of trajan which is always the sign of a conquest i ave sometimes fancied virgil alludes to this ustom in a verse that turnus speaks  non adeo has exosa manus victoria fugit virg aen li    if you consent he shall not be refused nor find a hand to victory unused mr dryden the emperors standing in a gown and making  present of his dacian victory to the city of rome agrees very well with claudians character of him   victura feretur gloria trajani non tam quod

mart li    epig   o rome thou goddess of the earth to whom no rival ever had birth nor second ever shall rise the heap of arms she sits on signifies the peace that the emperor had procured her on old coins we often see an emperor a victory the city of rome or a slave sitting on a heap of arms which always marks out the peace that arose from such an action as gave occasion to the medal i think we cannot doubt but virgil copied out this circumstance from the ancient sculptors in that inimitable description he has given us of military fury shut up in the temple of janus and laden with chains claudentur belli portae furor impius intus saeva sedens super arma et centum vinctus ahenis post tergum nodis fremet horridus ore cruento virg aen li   janus himself before his fane shall wait and keep the dreadful issues of his gate with bolts and iron bars within remains imprisoned fury bound in brazen chains high on a trophy raised of useless arms he sits and threats the world with dire alarms mr dryden we are told by the old scholiast says eugenius that there was actually such a statue in the temple of janus as that virgil has here described which i am almost apt to believe since you assure s that this part of the design is so often met with on ancient medals but have you nothing o remark on the figure of the province her posture says philander is what we often meet with in the slaves and captives of old coins among the poets too sitting on the ground is a mark of misery or captivity multos illa dies incomtis maesta capillis sederat  propert li   o utinam ante tuos sedeam captiva penates id l   o might i sit a captive at thy gate   you have the same posture in an old coin that celebrates a victory of lucius verus over the parthians fig    the captives hands are

shepherds bring a captive greek in bands before the king mr dryden cui dedit invitas victa noverca manus ov de fast cum rudis urgenti brachia victa dedi proper l   we may learn from ovid that it was sometimes the custom to place a slave with his arms bound at the foot of the trophy as in the figure before us stentque super vinctos trunca trophaea viros ov ep ex ponto l   you see on his head the cap which the parthians and indeed most of the eastern nations wear on medals they had not probably the ceremony of veiling the bonnet in their salutations for in medals they still have it on their heads whether they are before emperors or generals kneeling sitting or standing martial has distinguished them by this cap as their chief characteristic  frustra blanditae venitis ad me attritis

ground all prostrate fling some pict before his barbarous king  cannot hear says cynthio without a kind of indignation the satirical reflections that martial as made on the memory of domitian it is certain so ill an emperor deserved all the reproaches that could be heaped upon him but he ould not deserve them of martial i must confess i am less scandalized at the flatteries the epirammatist paid him living than the ingratitude e showed him dead a man may be betrayed unto the one by an overstrained complaisance or y a temper extremely sensible of favors and obligations whereas the other can arise from nothing but a natural baseness and villainy of oul it does not always happen says philaner that the poet and the honest man meet together in the same person i think we need enlarge o farther on this medal unless you have a mind o compare the trophy on it with that of meentius in virgil  ingentem quercum decisis undique ramis constituit tumulo fulgentiaque induit arma mezenti ducis

besmeared with blood his brazen buckler on the left was seen trunchions of shivered lances hung between and on the right was placed his corslet bored and to the neck was tied his unavailing sword mr dryden fig    on the next medal you see the peace that vespasian procured the empire after having happily finished all its wars both at home and abroad the woman with the olive branch in her hand is the figure of peace  pignora pacis praetendens dextra ramum canentis olivae sil it li   with the other hand she thrusts a lighted torch under a heap of armor that lies by an altar this alludes to a custom among the ancient romans of gathering up the armor that lay scattered on the field of battle and burning it as an offering to one of their deities it is to this custom that virgil refers and silius italicus has described at large  qualis eram cum primam aciem praeneste sub ipsa stravi scutorumque incendi victor acervos virg aen li   such as i was beneath praenestes walls then when i made the foremost foes retire and set whole heaps of conquered shields on fire mr dryden ast tibi bellipotens sacrum constructus acervo ingenti mons armorum consurgit ad astra ipse manu celsam pinum

pile the flaming torch he tossed in smouldring smoke the light of heaven is lost but when the fire increase of fury gains the blaze of glory gilds the distant plains as for the heap of arms and mountain of arms that the poet mentions you may see them on two coins of marcus aurelius fig    0 de sarmatis and de germanis allude perhaps to the form of words that might be used at the setting fire to them  ausonio de nomine those who will not allow of the interpretation i have put on these two last medals may think it an objection that there is no torch or fire near them to signify any such allusion but they may consider that on several imperial coins we meet with the figure of a funeral pile without any thing to denote the burning of it though indeed there is on some of them a flambeau sticking out on each side to let us know it was to be consumed to ashes  you have been so intent on the burning of the arms says cynthio that you have forgotten the pillar on your   th medal you may find the history of it says philander in ovid de fastis it was from this pillar that the spear was tossed at the opening of a war for which reason the little figure on the top of it holds a spear in its hand and peace turns her back upon it  prospicit a templo summum brevis area circum est ibi non parvae parva columna notae hinc solet hasta manu belli praenuncia mitti in regem et gentes cum placet arma capi ov de fast li   where the high fane the ample cirque commands a little but a noted pillar stands from hence when rome the distant kings defies in form the wardenouncing javelin flies fig    the different interpretations that have been made on the next medal seem to be forced and unnatural i will therefore give you my own opinion of it the vessel is here represented as stranded the figure before it seems to come in to its assistance and to lift it off the shallows for we see the water scarce eaches up to the knees though it is the figure of a man standing on firm ground his attendants and the good office he is employed upon resemble those the poets often attribute to neptune homer tells us that the whales leaped up at their gods approach as we see in the medal the two small figures that stand naked among the waves are seadeities of an inferior rank who are supposed to assist their sovereign in the succor he gives the distressed vessel cymothoe simul et triton adnixus acuto detrudunt naves scopulo levat ipse tridenti et vastas aperit syrtes et temperat aequor virg aen li   cymothoe triton and the seagreen train of beauteous nymphs the daughters of the main

et thetis et magnis nereus socer erigit ulnis val flac li   the interpreters of this medal have mistaken these two figures for the representation of two persons that are drowning but as they are both naked and drawn in a posture rather of triumphing over the waves than of sinking under them so we see abundance of waterdeities on other medals represented after the same manner ite deae virides liquidosque advertite vultus et vitreum teneris crinem redimite corymbis vest nihil tectae quales emergitis altis fontibus et visu satyros torquetis amantes statius de balneo etrusci lib   haste haste ye naiads with attractive art new charms to every native grace impart with opening flourets bind your seagreen hair unveiled and naked let your limbs appear so from the springs the satyrs see you rise and drink eternal passion at their eyes after having thus far cleared our way to the medal i take the thought of the reverse to be this the stranded vessel is the commonwealth of rome that by the tyranny of domitian and the insolence of the praetorian guards under nerva was quite run aground and in danger of perishing some of those embarked in it endeavor at her recovery but it is trajan that by the adoption of nerva stems the tide to her relief and like another neptune shoves her off the quicksands your device says eugenius hangs very well together but is not it liable to the same exceptions that you made us last night to such explications as have nothing but the writers imagination to support them to show you says philander that the construction i put on this medal is conformable to the fancies of the old romans you may observe that horace represents at length the commonwealth of rome under the figure of a ship in the allegory that you meet with in the fourteenth ode of his first book o navis referent in mare te novi fluctus  and shall the raging waves again bear thee back into the main mr creech nor was any thing more usual than to represent a god in the shape and dress of an emperor  apelleae cuperent te scribere cerae optassetque novo similem te ponere templo atticus elei senior jovis et tua mitis ora taras tua sidereas imitantia flammas lumina contempto mallet rhodos aspera phaebo statius de equo domitiani syl   now had apelles lived he would sue to grace his glowing tablets with thy godlike face phidias a sculptor for the powers above had wished to place thee with his ivory jove rhodes and tarentum that with pride survey the thundrer this and that the god of day each famed colossus would exchange for thee and own thy form the loveliest of the three for the thought in general you have just the same metaphorical compliment to theodosius in claudian as the medal here makes to trajan nulla relicta foret romani nominis umbra ni pater ille tuus jamjam ruitura subisset pondera turbatamque ratem certaque levasset naufragium commune manu  claudian de   to cons honorii had not thy sire deferred the impending fate and with his solid virtue propd the state sunk in oblivions shade the name of rome an empty name had scarce survived her doom halfwreckd she was till his auspicious hand resumed the rudder and regained the land i shall only add that this medal was stamped in honor of trajan when he was only caesar as appears by the face of itsari traiano  fig    the next is a reverse of marcus aurelius we have on it a minerva mounted on a monster that ausonius describes in the following verses illa etiam thalamos per trina aenigmata querens qui bipes et quadrupes foret et tripes omnia solus terruit aoniam volucris leo virgo triformis sphinx volucris pennis pedibusfera front puella to form the monster sphinx a triple kind man bird and beast by nature were combined with feathered fans she winged the aerial space and on her feet the lionclaws disgrace the bloomy features of a virginface over pale aonia pannic horror ran while in mysterious speech she thus began what animal when yet the morn is new walks on four legs infirm at noon on two but day declining to the western skies he needs a third a third the night supplies the monster says cynthio is a sphinx but for her meaning on this medal i am not o edipus enough to unriddle it i must confess says philander the poets fail me in this particular there is however a passage in pausanias that i will repeat to you though it is in prose since i know no body else that has explained the medal by it the athenians says he drew a sphinx on the armor of pallas by reason of the strength and sagacity of this animal the sphinx therefore signifies the same as minerva herself who was the goddess of arms as well as wisdom and describes the emperor as one of the poets expresses it  studiis florentem utriusque minervae whom both minervas boast tadopt their own the romans joined both devices together to make the emblem the more significant as indeed they could not too much extol the learning and military virtues of this excellent emperor who was the best philosopher and greatest general of his age  we will close up this series of medals with one that was stamped under tiberius to the memory of augustus fig    over his head you see the star that his father julius caesar was supposed to have been changed into ecce dionaei processit caesaris astrum virg ecl   see caesars lamp is lighted in the skies mr dryden  micat inter omnes julium sidus velut

it soared a comet grew above the lunar sphere it took its flight and shot behind it a long trail of light mr welsted virgil draws the same figure of augustus on aeneass shield as we see on this medal the commentators tell us that the star was engraven on augustuss helmet but we may be sure virgil means such a figure of the emperor as he used o be represented by in the roman sculpture and ch a one as we may suppose this to be that we ave before us hinc augustus agens italos in praelia caesar cum patribus populoque penatibus et magnis diis stans celsa in puppi geminas cui tempora flammas laeta

letalia tela diel de piscibus captis aus eid  0 caligo terrae scinditur percussa solis spiculo prud him   i have now given you a sample of such emblematical medals as are unriddled by the latin poets and have shown several passages in the latin poets that receive an illustration from medals some of the coins we have had before us have not been explained by others as many of them have been explained in a different manner there are indeed others that have had very near the same explication put upon them but as this explication has been supported by no authority it can at best be looked upon but as a probable conjecture it is certain says eugenius there cannot be any more authentic illustrations of roman medals especially of those that are full of fancy than such as are drawn out of the latin poets for as there is a great affinity between designing and poetry so the latin poets and the designers of the roman medals lived very near one another were acquainted with the same customs conversant with the same objects and bred up to the same relish for wit and fancy but who are the ladies that we are next to examine these are says philander so many cities nations and provinces that present themselves to you under the shape of women what you take for a fine lady at first sight when you come to look into her will prove a town a country or one of the four parts of the world in short you have now afric spain france italy and several other nations of the earth before you this is one of the pleasantest maps says cynthio that i ever saw your geographers now and then fancy a country like a leg or a head a bear or a dragon but i never before saw them represented like women i could not have thought your mountains seas and promontories could have made up an assembly of such wellshaped persons this therefore says philander is a geography particular to the medallists the poets however have sometimes given into it and furnish us with very ood lights for the explication of it third series fig   the first lady you see on the list is africa she carries an elephants tooth y her side dentibus ex illis quos mittit porta syenes et mauri celeres et mauro obscurior indus et

my opinion have a great deal of poetry in them i have often wondered at mr dryden for passing so severe a censure on this author he fancies the description of a wreck that you have already cited is too good for persius and that he might be helped in it by lucan who was one of his contemporaries for my part says cynthio i am so far from mr drydens opinion in this particular that i fancy persius a better poet than lucan and that had he been engaged on the same subject he would at least in his expressions and descriptions have outwrit the pharsalia he was indeed employed on subjects that seldom led him into any thing like description but where he has an occasion of showing himself we find very few of the latin poets that have given a greater beauty to their expressions his obscurities are indeed sometimes affected but they generally arise from the remoteness of the customs persons and things he alludes to as satyr is for this reason more difficult to be understood by those that are not of the same age with it than any other kind of poetry loveverses and heroics deal in images that are ever fixed and settled in the nature of things but a thousand ideas enter into satyr that are as changeable and unsteady as the mode or the humors of mankind  our three friends had passed away the whole morning among their medals and latin poets philander told them it was now too late to enter on another series but if they would take up with such a dinner as he could meet with at his lodgings he would afterward lay the rest of his medals before them cynthio and eugenius were both of them so well pleased with the novelty of the subject that they would not refuse the offer philander made them  dialogue iii  causa est discriminis hujus concisum argentum in titulos faciesque minutas juv sat    a parallel between the ancient and modern medals philander used every morning to take a walk in a neighboring wood that stood on the borders of the thames it was cut through by abundance of beautiful allies which erminating on the water looked like so many ainted views in perspective the banks of the iver and the thickness of the shades drew into them all the birds of the country that at sunrising filled the wood with such a variety of notes as made the prettiest confusion imaginable i know in descriptions of this nature the scenes are generally supposed to grow out of the authors imagination and if they are not charming in all their parts the reader never imputes it to the want of sun or soil but to the writers barrenness of invention it is ciceros observation on the planetree that makes so flourishing a figure in one of platos dialogues that it did not draw its nourishment from the fountain that ra by it and watered its roots but from the richness of the style that describes it for my own part as i design only to fix the scene of the following dialogue i shall not endeavor to give it any other ornaments than those which nature has bestowed upon it  philander was here enjoying the cool of the morning among the dews that lay on every thing about him and that gave the air such a freshness as is not a little agreeable in the hot part of the year he not been here long before he was joined by cynthio and eugenius cynthio immediately fell upon philander for breaking his nights rest you have so filled my head says he with old coins that i have had nothing but figures and inscriptions before my eyes if i chanced to fall into a little slumber it was immediately interrupted with the vision of a caduceus or a cornucopiae you will make me believe says philander that you begin to be reconciled to medals they say it is a sure sign a man loves money when he is used to find it in his dreams there is certainly says eugenius something like avarice in the study of medals the more a man knows of them the more he desires to know there is one subject in particular that cynthio as well as my self has a mind to engage you in we would fain know how the ancient and modern medals differ from one another and which of them deserves the preference you have a mind to engage me in a subject says philander that is perhaps of a larger extent than you imagine to examine it thoroughly it would be necessary to take them in pieces and to speak of the difference that shows it self in their metals in the occasion of stamping them in the inscriptions and in the figures that adorn them since you have divided your subject says cynthio be so kind as to enter on it without any further preface  we should first of all says philander consider the difference of the metals that we find in ancient and modern coins but as this speculation is more curious than improving i believe you will excuse me if i do not dwell long upon it one may understand all the learned part of this science without knowing whether there were coins of iron or lead among the old romans and if a man is well acquainted with the device of a medal i do not see what necessity there is of being able to tell whether the medal it self be of copper or corinthian brass there is however so great a difference between the antique and modern medals that i have seen an antiquary lick an old coin among other trials to distinguish the age of it by its taste i remember when i laughed at him for it he told me with a great deal of vehemence there was as much difference between the relish of ancient and modern brass as between an apple and a turnep it is pity says engenius but they found out the smell too of an ancient medal they would then be able to judge of it by all the senses the touch i have heard gives almost as good evidence as the sight and the ringing of a medal is i know a very common experiment but i suppose this last proof you mention relates only to such coins as are made of your baser sorts of metal and here says philander we may observe the prudence of the ancients above that of the moderns in the care they took to perpetuate the memory of great actions they knew very well that silver and gold might fall into the hands of the covetous or ignorant who would not respect them for the device they bore but for the metal they were made of nor were their apprehensions illfounded for it is not easily imagined how many of these noble monuments of history have perished in the goldsmiths hands before they came to be collected together by the learned men of these two or three last centuries inscriptions victories buildings and a thousand other pieces of antiquity were melted down in those barbarous ages that thought figures and letters only served to spoil the gold that was charged with them your medallists look on this destruction of coins as on the burning of the alexandrian library and would be content to compound for them with almost the loss of a vatican to prevent this in some measure the ancients placed the greatest variety of their devices on their brass and copper coins which are in no fear of falling into the clippers hands nor in any danger of melting till the general conflagration on the contrary our modern medals are most in silver or gold and often in a very small number of each i have seen a golden one at vienna of philip the second that weighed two and twenty pound which is probably singular in its kind and will not be able to keep it self long out of the furnace when it leaves the emperors treasury i remember another in the king of prussias collection that has in it three pound weight of gold the princes who struck these medals says eugenius seem to have designed them rather as an ostentation of their wealth than of their virtues they fancied probably it was a greater honor to appear in gold than in copper and that a medal receives all its value from the rarity of the metal i think the next subject you proposed to speak of were the different occasions that have given birth to ancient and modern medals  before we enter on this particular says philander i must tell you by way of preliminary that formerly there was no difference between money and medals an old roman had his purse full of the same pieces that we now preserve in cabinets as soon as an emperor had done any thing remarkable it was immediately stamped on a coin and became current through his whole dominions it was a pretty contrivance says cynthio to spread abroad the virtues of an emperor and make his actions circulate a fresh coin was a kind of a gazette that published the latest news of the empire i should fancy your roman bankers were very good historians it is certain says eugenius they might find their profit and instruction mixed together i have often wondered that no nation among the moderns has imitated the ancient romans in this particular i know no other way of securing these kinds of monuments and making them numerous enough to be handed down to future ages but where statesmen are ruled by a spirit of faction and interest they can have no passion for the glory of their country nor any concern for the figure it will make among posterity a man that talks of his nations honor a thousand years hence is in very great danger of being laughed at we shall think says cynthio you have a mind to fall out with the government because it does not encourage medals but were all your ancient coins that are now in cabinets once current money it is the most probable opinion says philander that they were all of them such excepting those we call medalions these in respect of the other coins were the same as modern medals in respect of modern money they were exempted from all commerce and had no other value but what was set upon them by the fancy of the owner they are supposed to have been struck by emperors for presents to their friends foreign princes or ambassadors however that the smallness of their number might not endanger the loss of the devices they bore the romans took care generally to stamp the subject of their medalions on their ordinary coins that were the running cash of the nation as if in england we should see on our halfpenny and farthing pieces the several designs that show themselves in their perfection on our medals  if we now consider continued philander the different occasions or subjects of ancient and modern medals we shall find they both agree in recording the great actions and successes in war allowing still for the different ways of making it and the circumstances that attended it in past ages and in the present i shall instance one i do not remember in any old coin to have seen the taking of a town mentioned as indeed there were few conquerors could signalize themselves that way before the invention of powder and fortifications a single battle often deciding the fate of whole kingdoms our modern medals give us several sieges and plans of fortified towns that show themselves in all their parts to a great advantage on the reverse of a coin it is indeed a kind of justice says eugenius that a prince owes to posterity after he has ruined or defaced a strong place to deliver down to them a model of it as it stood whole and entire the coin repairs in some measure the mischiefs of his bombs and cannons in the next place says philander we see both on the ancient and modern medals the several noble pieces of architecture that were finished at the time when the medals were stamped i must observe however to the honor of the latter that they have represented their buildings according to the rules of perspective this i remember to have seen but in very few of the plans on ancient coins which makes them appear much less beautiful than the modern especially to a mathematical eye thus far our two setts of medals agree as to their subject but old coins go farther in their compliments to their emperor as they take occasion to celebrate his distinguishing virtues not as they showed themselves in any particular action but as they shone out in the general view of his character this humor went so far that we see neros fidling and commoduss skill in fencing on several of their medals at present you never meet with the king of frances generosity nor the emperors devotion recorded after this manner again the romans used to register the great actions of peace that turned to the good of the people as well as those of war the remission of a debt the taking off a duty the giving up a tax the mending a port or the making a highway were not looked upon as improper subjects for a coin they were glad of any opportunity to encourage their emperors in the humor of doing good and knew very well that many of these acts of beneficence had a wider and more lasting influence on the happiness and welfare of a people than the gaining a victory or the conquest of a nation in england perhaps it would have looked a little odd to have stamped a medal on the abolishing of chimneymoney in the last reign or on the giving a hundred thousand pound a year toward the carrying on a war in this i find says eugenius had we struck in with the practice of the ancient romans we should have had medals on the fitting up our several docks on the making of our rivers navigable on the building our men of war and the like subjects that have certainly very well deserved them the reason why it has been neglected says philander may possibly be this our princes have the coining of their own medals and perhaps may think it would look like vanity to erect so many trophies and monuments of praise to their own merit whereas among the ancient romans the senate had still a watchful eye on their emperor and if they found any thing in his life and actions that might furnish out a medal they did not fail of making him so acceptable an offering it is true their flatteries betray often such a baseness of spirit as one would little expect to find among such an order of men and here by the way we may observe that you never find any thing like satyr or raillery on old coins  whatever victories were got on foreign enemies or the several pretenders to the empire obtained over one another they are recorded on coins without the least bitterness or reflection the emperors often jested on their rivals or predecessors but their mints still maintained their gravity they might publish invectives against one another in their discourses or writings but never on their coins had we no other histories of the roman emperors but those we find on their money we should take them for the most virtuous race of princes that mankind were ever blessed with whereas if we look into their lives they appear many of them such monsters of lust and cruelty as are almost a reproach to human nature medals are therefore so many compliments to an emperor that ascribe to him all the virtues and victories he himself pretended to were you to take from hence all your informations you would fancy claudius as great a conqueror as julius caesar and domitian a wiser prince than his brother titus tiberius on his coins is all mercy and moderation caligula and nero are fathers of their country galba the patron of public liberty and vitellius the restorer of the city of rome in short if you have a mind to see the religious commodus the pious caracalla and the devout heliogabalus you may find them either in the inscription or device of their medals on the contrary those of a modern make are often charged with irony and satyr our kings no sooner fall out but their mints make war upon one another and their malice appears on their medals one meets sometimes with very nice touches of raillery but as we have no instance of it among the ancient coins i shall leave you to determine whether or no it ought to find a place there i must confess says cynthio i believe we are generally in the wrong when we deviate from the ancients because their practice is for the most part grounded upon reason but if our forefathers have thought fit to be grave and serious i hope their posterity may laugh without offense for my part i cannot but look on this kind of raillery as a refinement on medals and do not see why there may not be some for diversion at the same time that there are others of a more solemn and majestic nature as a victory may be celebrated in an epigram as well as in an heroic poem had the ancients given place to raillery on any of their coins i question not but they would have been the most valued parts of a collection besides the entertainment we should have found in them they would have shown us the different state of wit as it flourished or decayed in the several ages of the roman empire there is no doubt says philander but our forefathers if they had pleased could have been as witty as their posterity but i am of opinion they industriously avoided it on their coins that they might not give us occasion to suspect their sincerity had they run into mirth or satyr we should not have thought they had designed so much to instruct as to divert us i have heard says eugenius that the romans stamped several coins on the same occasion if we follow their example there will be no danger of deceiving posterity since the more serious sort of medals may serve as comments on those of a lighter character however it is the raillery of the moderns cannot be worse than the flattery of the ancients but hitherto you have only mentioned such coins as were made on the emperor i have seen several of our own time that have been made as a compliment to private persons there are pieces of money says philander that during the time of the roman emperors were coined in honor of the senate army or people i do not remember to have seen in the upper empire the face of any private person that was not some way related to the imperial family sejanus has indeed his consulship mentioned on a coin of tiberius as he has the honor to give a name to the year in which our savior was crucified we are now come to the legend or inscription of our medals which as it is one of the more essential parts of them it may deserve to be examined more at length you have chosen a very short text to enlarge upon says cynthio i should as soon expect to see a critique on the posie of a ring as on the inscription of a medal  i have seen several modern coins says philander that have had part of the legend running round the edges like the decus et tutamen in our milled money so that a few years will probably wear out the action that the coin was designed to perpetuate the ancients were too wise to register their exploits on so nice a surface i should fancy says eugenius the moderns may have chosen this part of the medal for the inscription that the figures on each side might appear to a greater advantage i have observed in several old coins a kind of confusion between the legend and the device the figures and letters were so mingled together that one would think the coiner was hard put to it on what part of the money to bestow the several words of his inscription you have found out something like an excuse says philander for your milled medals if they carried the whole legend on their edges but at the same time that they are lettered on the edges they have other inscriptions on the face and the reverse your modern designers cannot contract the occasion of the medal into an inscription that is proper to the volume they write upon so that having scribbled over both sides they are forced as it were to write upon the margin the first fault therefore that i shall find with a modern legend is its diffusiveness you have sometimes the whole side of a medal overrun with it one would fancy the author had a design of being ciceronian in his latin and of making a round period i will give you only the reverse of a coin stamped by the present emperor of germany on the raising of the siege of vienna vienna avstria    ivlii ab achmete ii obsessa   sept ex insperato ab eo deserta est i should take this says cynthio for the paragraph of a gazette rather than the inscription of a medal i remember you represented your ancient coins as abridgements of history but your modern if there are many of them like this should themselves be epitomized compare with this says philander the brevity and comprehensiveness of those legends that appear on ancient coins salus generis humani tellus stabilita gloria orbis terrae pacator orbis restitutor orbis terrarum gaudium reipublicae hilaritas pouli romani bono reipub nati roma renacens libertas restituta saeculum aureum puellae faustinianae rex parthis datus victoria germanica fides mutua asia subacta judaea capta amor mutuus genetrix orbis sideribus recepta genio senatus fides exercitus providentia senatus restitutori hispaniae adventui aug britanniae regna adsignata adlocutio discipulina augusti felicitas publica rex armenis datus what a majesty and force does one meet with in these short inscriptions are not you amazed to see so much history gathered into so small a compass you have often the subject of a volume in a couple of words  if our modern medals are so very prolix in their prose they are every whit as tedious in their verse you have sometimes a dull epigram of four lines this says cynthio may be of great use to immortalize punns and quibbles and to let posterity see their forefathers were a parcel of blockheads a coin i find may be of great use to a bad poet if he cannot become immortal by the goodness of his verse he may by the durableness of the metal that supports it i shall give you an instance says philander from a medal of gustavus adolphus that will stand as an eternal monument of dullness and bravery miles ego christi christo duce sterno tyrannos haereticos simul et calco meis pedibus parcere christicolis me debellare feroces papicolas christus dux meus en animat   it is well says cynthio you tell us this is a medal of the great gustavus i should have taken it for some one of his gothic predecessors does it not bring into your mind alexander the greats being accompanied with a chaerilus in his persian expedition if you are offended at the homeliness of this inscription says philander what would you think of such as have neither sense nor grammar in them i assure you i have seen the face of many a great monarch hemmed in with false latin but it is not only the stupidity and tediousness of these inscriptions that i find fault with supposing them of a moderate length and proper sense why must they be in verse we should be surprised to see the title of a serious book in rhyme yet it is every whit as ridiculous to give the subject of a medal in a piece of an hexameter this however is the practice of our modern medallists if you look into the ancient inscriptions you see an air of simplicity in the words but a great magnificence in the thought on the contrary in your modern medals you have generally a trifling thought wrapped up in the beginning or end of an heroic verse where the sense of an inscription is low it is not in the power of dactyls and spondees to raise it where it is noble it has no need of such affected ornaments i remember a medal of philip the second on charles le quints resigning to him the kingdom of spain with this inscription ut quiescat atlas the device is a hercules with the sphere on his shoulders notwithstanding the thought is poetical i dare say you would think the beauty of the inscription very much lost had it been  requiescat ut atlas to instance a medal of our own nation after the conclusion of the peace with holland there was one stamped with the following legend  redeant commercia flandris the thought is here great enough but in my opinion it would have looked much greater in two or three words of prose i think truly says eugenius it is ridiculous enough to make the inscription run like a piece of a verse when it is not taken out of an old author but i would fain have your opinion on such inscriptions as are borrowed from the latin poets i have seen several of this sort that have been very prettily applied and i fancy when they are chosen with art they should not be thought unworthy of a place in your medals  which ever side i take says philander i am like to have a great party against me those who have formed their relish on old coins will by no means allow of such an innovation on the contrary your men of wit will be apt to look on it as an improvement on ancient medals you will oblige us however to let us know what kind of rules you would have observed in the choice of your quotations since you seem to lay a stress on their being chosen with art you must know then says eugenius i do not think it enough that a quotation tells us plain matter of fact unless it has some other accidental ornaments to set it off indeed if a great action that seldom happens in the course of human affairs is exactly described in the passage of an old poet it gives the reader a very agreeable surprise and may therefore deserve a place on a medal  again if there is more than a single circumstance of the action specified in the quotation it pleases a man to see an old exploit copied out as it were by a modern and running parallel with it in several of its particulars  in the next place when the quotation is not only apt but has in it a turn of wit or satyr it is still the better qualified for a medal as it has a double capacity of pleasing  but there is no inscription fitter for a medal in my opinion than a quotation that besides its aptness has something in it lofty and sublime for such an one strikes in with the natural greatness of the soul and produces a high idea of the person or action it celebrates which is one of the principal designs of a medal  it is certainly very pleasant says eugenius to see a verse of an old poet revolting as it were from its original sense and siding with a modern subject but then it ought to do it willingly of its own accord without being forced to it by any change in the words or the punctuation for when this happens it is no longer the verse of an ancient poet but of him that has converted it to his own use  you have i believe by this time exhausted your subject says philander and i think the criticisms you have made on the poetical quotations that we so often meet with in our modern medals may be very well applied to the mottos of books and other inscriptions of the same nature but before we quit the legends of medals i cannot but take notice of a kind of wit that flourishes very much on many of the modern especially those of germany when they represent in the inscription the year in which they were coined as to mention to you another of gustavus adolphus chr is it us dvx ergo tr ivmph us if you take the pains to pick out the figures from the several words and range them in their proper order you will find they amount to      the year in which the medal was coined for do not you observe some of the letters distinguish themselves from the rest and top it over their fellows these you must consider in a double capacity as letters and as ciphers your laborious german wits will turn you over a whole dictionary for one of these ingenious devices you would fancy perhaps they were searching after an apt classical term but instead of that they are looking out a word that has an l an m or a d in it when therefore you see any of these inscriptions you are not so much to look in them for the thought as for the year of the lord there are foreign universities where this kind of wit is so much in vogue that as you praise a man in england for being an excellent philosopher or poet it is an ordinary character among them to be a great chronogrammatist these are probably says cynthio some of those mild provinces of acrostic land that mr dryden has assigned to his anagrams wings and altars we have now done i suppose with the legend of a medal i think you promised us in the next place to speak of the figures  as we had a great deal of talk on this part of a coin replied philander in our discourse on the usefulness of ancient medals i shall only just touch on the chief heads wherein the ancient and the modern differ in the first place the romans always appear in the proper dress of their country insomuch that you see the little variations of the mode in the drapery of the medal they would have thought it ridiculous to have drawn an emperor of rome in a grecian cloak or a phrygian mitre on the contrary our modern medals are full of togas and tunicas trabeas and paludamentums with a multitude of the like antiquated garments that have not been in fashion these thousand years you see very often a king of england or france dressed up like a julius caesar one would think they had a mind to pass themselves upon posterity for roman emperors the same observation may run through several customs and religions that appear in our ancient and modern coins nothing is more usual than to see allusions to roman customs and ceremonies on the medals of our own nation nay very often they carry the figure of a heathen god if posterity takes its notions of us from our medals they must fancy one of our kings paid a great devotion to minerva that another was a professed worshipper of apollo or at best that our whole religion was a mixture of paganism and christianity had the old romans been guilty of the same extravagance there would have been so great a confusion in their antiquities that their coins would not have had half the uses we now find in them we ought to look on medals as so many monuments consigned over to eternity that may possibly last when all other memorials of the same age are worn out or lost they are a kind of present that those who are actually in being make over to such as lie hid within the depths of futurity were they only designed to instruct the three or four succeeding generations they are in no great danger of being misunderstood but as they may pass into the hands of a posterity that ie many removes from us and are like to act their part in the world when its governments manners and religions may be quite altered we ought to take a particular care not to make any false reports in them or to charge them with any devices that may look doubtful or unintelligible  i have lately seen says eugenius a medallic history of the present king of france one might expect methinks to see the medals of that nation in the highest perfection when there is a society pensioned and set apart on purpose for the designing of them  we will examine them if you please says philander in the light that our foregoing observations have set them but on this condition that you do not look on the faults i find in them any more than my own private opinion in the first place then i think it is impossible to learn from the french medals either the religion custom or habits of the french nation you see on some of them the cross of our savior and on others hercules his club in one you have an angel and in another a mercury i fancy says cynthio posterity would be as much puzzled on the religion of louis le grand were they to learn it from his medals as we are at present on that of constantine the great it is certain says philander there is the same mixture of christian and pagan in their coins nor is there a less confusion in their customs for example what relation is there between the figure of a bull and the planting of a french colony in america the romans made use of this type in allusion to one of their own customs at the sending out of a colony but for the french a ram a hog or an elephant would have been every whit as significant an emblem then can any thing be more unnatural than to see a king of france dressed like an emperor of rome with his arms stripped up to the elbows a laurel on his head and a chlamys over his shoulders i fancy says eugenius the society of medallists would give you their reasons for what they have done you your self allow the legend to be latin and why may not the customs and ornaments be of the same country as the language especially since they are all of them so universally understood by the learned i own to you says philander if they only design to deliver down to posterity the several parts of their great monarchs history it is no matter for the other circumstances of a medal but i fancy it would be as great a pleasure and instruction for future ages to see the dresses and customs of their ancestors as their buildings and victories besides i do not think they have always chosen a proper occasion for a medal there is one struck for example on the english failing in their attempts on dunkirk when in the last reign they endeavored to blow up a fort and bombard the town what have the french here done to boast of a medal however you have with this inscription dvnkirka illaesa not to cavil at the two ks in dunkirka or the impropriety of the word illaesa he whole medal in my opinion tends not so much to the honor of the french as of the engish  quos opimus fallere et effugere est triumphus i could mention a few other faults or at least what i take for such but at same time must be forced to allow that this series of medals is the most perfect of any among the moderns in the beauty of the work the aptness of the device and the propriety of the legend in these and other particulars the french medals come nearer the ancients than those of any other country as indeed it is to this nation we are indebted for the best lights that have been given to the whole science in general  i must not here forget to mention the medallic history of the popes where there are many coins of an excellent workmanship as i think they have none of those faults that i have spoken of in the preceding set they are always romancatholic in the device and in the legend which are both of them many times taken out of the holy scriptures and therefore not unsuitable to the character of the prince they represent thus when innocent xi lay under terrible apprehensions of the french king he put out a coin that on the reverse of it had a ship tossed on the waves to represent the church before it was the figure of our savior walking on the waters and st peter ready to sink at his feet the inscription if i remember was in latin help lord or else i perish this puts me in mind says cynthio of a pasquinade that at the same ime was fixed up at rome ad galli cantum petrus flet but methinks under this head of the figures on ancient and modern coins we might expect to hear your opinion on the difference that appears in the workmanship of each you must know then says philander that till about the end of the third century when there was a general decay in all the arts of designing i do not remember to have seen the head of a roman emperor drawn with a full face they always appear in profil to use a french term of art which gives us the view of a head that in my opinion has something in it very majestic and at the same time suits best with the dimensions of a medal besides that it shows the nose and eyebrows with the several prominencies and fallings in of the features much more distinctly than any other kind of figure in the lower empire you have abundance of broad gothic faces like so many full moons on the side of a coin among the moderns too we have of both sorts though the finest are made after the antique in the next place you find the figures of many ancient coins rising up in a much more beautiful relief than those on the modern this too is a beauty that fell with the grandeur of the roman emperors so that you see the face sinking by degrees in the several declensions of the empire till about constantines time it lies almost even with the surface of the medal after this it appears so very plain and uniform that one would think the coiner looked on the flatness of a figure as one of the greatest beauties in sculpture i fancy says eugenius the sculptors of that age had the same relish as a greek priest that was buying some religious pictures at venice among others he was shown a noble piece of titian the priest having well surveyed it was very much scandalized at the extravagance of the relief as he termed it you know says he our religion forbids all idolatry we admit of no images but such as are drawn on a smooth surface the figure you have here shown me stands so much out to the eye that i would no sooner suffer it in my church than a statue i could recommend your greek priest says philander to abundance of celebrated painters on this side of the alps that would not fail to please him we must own however that the figures on several of our modern medals are raised and rounded to a very great perfection but if you compare them in this particular with the most finished among the ancients your men of art declare universally for the latter  cynthio and eugenius though they were well pleased with philanders discourse were glad however to find it at an end for the sun began to gather strength upon them and had pierced the shelter of their walks in several places philander had no sooner done talking but he grew sensible of the heat himself and immediately proposed to his friends the retiring to his lodgings and getting a thicker shade over their heads they both of them very readily closed with the proposal and by that means give me an opportunity of finishing

                           the present tate of the war and the cessity of an augmentation considered  preface the author of the following essay has endeavored to draw into one continued scheme the whole state of the present war and the methods that appear to him the most proper or bringing it to a happy conclusion  after having considered that the french are the constant and most dangerous enemies to the british ation and that the danger from them is now greaer than ever and will still increase till their present union with spain be broken he sets forth he several advantages which this union has already given france and taken from great britain in reation to the west indies the woollen manufacture the trade of the levant and the naval power of the two nations  he shows how these advantages will still rise higher after a peace notwithstanding our present conquests with new additions should be confirmed to us as well because the monarchy of spain would not be weakened by such concessions as because no guarantee could be found sufficient to secure them to us for which reasons he lays it down as a fixed rule that no peace is to be made without an entire disunion of the french and spanish monarchies  that this may be brought about he endeavors to prove from the progress we have already made toward it and the successes w have purchased in the present war which are very considerable if well pursued but of no effect if we acquiesce in them  in order to complete this disunion in which we have gone so far he would not have us rely upon exhausting the french treasury attempts on the spanish indies descents on france but chiefly upon outnumbring them in troops france being already drained of her best supplies and the confederates masters of much greater forces for multitude and strength both in men and horse and provided with generals of greater fame and abilities  he then considers the wrong measures we have hitherto taken in making too small levies after a successful campaign in regulating their number by that of the enemies forces and hiring them of our confederates showing at the same time the inconveniences we suffer from such hired troops and several advantages we might receive from employing those of our own nation  he further recommends this augmentation of our forces to prevent the keeping up a standing body of them in times of peace to enable us to make an impression on the enemy in the present posture of the war and to secure our selves against a prince who is now at the head of a powerful army and has not yet declared himself  in the last place he answers by several considerations those two popular objections that we furnish more toward the war than the rest of the allies and that we are not able to contribute more than we do already  these are the most material heads of the following essay in which there are many other subordinate reflections that naturally grow out of so copious a subject  november   0   the present state of the war and the necessity of an augmentation considered the french are certainly the most implacable and the most dangerous enemies of the british nation their form of government their religion their jealousy of the british power as well as their prosecutions or commerce and pursuits of universal monarchy will fix them for ever in their animosities and aversions toward us and make them catch at all opportunities of subverting our constitution destroying our religion ruining our trade and sinking the figure which we make among the nations of europe not to mention the particular ties of honor that lie on their present king to impose on us a prince who must prove fatal to our country if he ever reigns over us  as we are thus in a natural state of war if i may so call it with the french nation it is our misfortune that they are not only the most inveterate but most formidable of our enemies and have the greatest power as well as the strongest inclination to ruin us no other state equals them in the force of their fleets and armies in the nearness and convenience of their situation and in the number of friends and wellwishers which it is to be feared they have among us  for these reasons our wars with france have always affected us in our most tender interests and concerned us more than those we have had with any other nation but i may venture to say this kingdom was never yet engaged in a war of so great consequence as that which now lies upon our hands our all is at stake and irretrievably lost if we fail of success at other times if a war ended in a dishonorable peace or with equal loss we could comfort our selves with the hopes of a more favorable juncture that might set the balance right or turn it to our advantage we had still the prospect of forming the same alliance or perhaps strengthening it with new confederacies and by that means of trying our fortune a second time in case the injustice or ambition of the enemy forced us into the field at present if we make a drawn game of it or procure but moderate advantages we are in a condition which every british heart must tremble at the thought of there are no second trials no wars in reserve no new schemes of alliance to which we can have recourse should the french king be able to bear down such an united force as now makes head against him at a time when spain affords him no greater assistance what will he do when the trade of the levant lies at his mercy when the whole kingdom of spain is supplied with his manufactures and the wealth of the indies flows into his coffers and what is yet worse when this additional strength must arise in all its particulars from a proportionable decay in the states that now make war upon him it is no wonder therefore that our late king of glorious memory who by the confession of his greatest enemies was a prince that perfectly understood the interests of europe should in his last speech recommend to his parliament the declaring war against france in those memorable words you have yet an opportunity by gods blessing to secure to you and your posterity the quiet enjoyment of your religion and liberties if you are not wanting to your selves but will exert the ancient vigor of the english nation but i tell you plainly my opinion is if you do not lay hold on this occasion you have no reason to hope for another  we have already a dreadful proof of the increase of power that accrues to france from its conjunction with spain so expensive a war as that which the french monarchy has been carrying on in so many and so remote parts at once must long since have drained and exhausted all its substance had there not been several secret springs that swelled their treasury from time to time in proportion as the war has sunk it the kings coffers have been often reduced to the lowest ebb but have still been seasonably refreshed by frequent and unexpected supplies from the spanish america we hear indeed of the arrival but of very few ships from those parts but as in every vessel there is stowage for immense treasures when the cargo is pure bullion or merchandise of as great a value so we find by experience they have had such prodigious sums of money conveyed to them by these secret channels that they have been enabled to pay more numerous armies than they ever had on foot before and that at a time when their trade fails in all its other branches and is distressed by all the arts and contrivances of their neighboring nations during the last four years by a modest computation there have been brought into breast above six millions of pounds sterling in bullion what then shall we suppose would be the effect of this correspondence with america might the wealth of those parts come to them on squadrons of men of war and fleets of galeons if these little bycurrents that creep into the country by stealth have so great a force how shall we stem the whole torrent when it breaks in upon us with its full violence and this certainly will be our case unless we find a means to dissolve the union between france and spain i have dwelt the longer on this consideration because the present war has already furnished us with the experiment and sensibly convinced us of the increase of power which france has received from its intercourse with the spanish west indies  as there are many who look upon every thing which they do not actually see and feel as b probability and speculation i shall only touch on those other reasons of which we have already had some experience for our preventing this coalition of interests and designs in the two monarchies  the woollen manufacture is the british strength the staple commodity and proper growth of our country if this fails us our trade and estates must sink together and all the cash of the nation be consumed on foreign merchandise the french at present gain very much upon us in this great article of our trade and since the accession of the spanish monarchy supply with cloth of their own making the very best mart we had in europe and what a melancholy prospect have we if ever a peace gives them leave to enrich their manufacture with mixtures of spanish wool to multiply the hands employed in it to improve themselves in all the niceties of the art and to vend their wares in those places where was the greatest consumption of our woollen works and the most considerable gain for the british merchant notwithstanding our many seasonable recruits from portugal and our plantations we already complain of our want of bullion and must at last be reduced to the greatest exigencies if this great source be dried up and our traffic with spain continue under its present discouragement  the trade of the levant must likewise flourish or decay in our hands as we are friends or enemies of the spanish monarchy the late conquest of naples will very little alter the case though sicily should follow the fate of her sister kingdom the streights mouth is the key of the levant and will be always in the possession of those who are kings of spain we may only add that the same causes which straiten the british commerce will naturally enlarge the french and that the naval force of either nation will thrive or languish in the same degree as their commerce gathers or loses strength and if so powerful and populous a nation as that of france become superior to us by sea our whole is lost and we are no more a people the consideration of so narrow a channel betwixt us of such numbers of regular troops on the enemys side of so small a standing force on our own and that too in a country destitute of all such forts and strong places as might stop the progress of a victorious army has something in it so terrifying that one does not care for setting it in its proper light let it not therefore enter into the heart of any one that has the least zeal for his religion or love of liberty that has any regard either to the honor or safety of his country or a well wish for his friends or posterity to think of a peace with france till the spanish monarchy be entirely torn from it and the house of bourbon disabled from ever giving the law to europe  let us suppose that the french king would grant us the most advantageous terms we can desire without the separation of the two monarchies they must infallibly end in our destruction should he secure to us all our present acquisitions should he add two or three frontiertowns to what we have already in flanders should he join the kingdoms of sicily and sardinia to milan and naples should he leave king charles in the peaceable possession of catalonia should he make over to great britain the town and harbor of cadiz as well as that of gibraltar and at the same time resign his conquests in portugal it would all be of no effect toward the common safety of europe while the bulk of the spanish continent and the riches of america remain in the possession of the bourbon family  boccalini when he weighs the states of europe in his political balance after having laid france ill one scale throws spain into the other which wanted but very little of being a counterpoise the spaniards upon this says he begun to promise themselves the honor of the balance reckoning that if spain of it self weighed so well they could not fail of success when the several parts of the monarchy were lumped in the same scale their surprise was very great when upon the throwing in of naples they saw the scale rise and was greater still when they found that milan and flanders had the same effect the truth of it is these parts of the spanish monarchy are rather for ornament than strength they furnish out viceroyalties for the grandees and posts of honor for the noble families but in a time of war are encumbrances to the main body of the kingdom and leave it naked and exposed by the great number of hands they draw from it to their defense should we therefore continue in the possession of what we have already made our selves masters with such additions as have been mentioned we should have little more than the excrescencies of the spanish monarchy the strength of it will still join it self to france and grow the closer to it by its disunion from the rest and in this case the advantages which must arise to that people from their intimate alliance with the remaining part of the spanish dominions would in a very few years not only repair all the damages they have sustained in the present war but fill the kingdom with more riches than it has yet had in its most flourishing periods  the french king has often entered on several expensive projects on purpose to dissipate the wealth that is continually gathering in his coffers in times of peace he has employed immense sums on architecture gardening waterworks painting statuary and the like to distribute his treasures among his people as well as to humor his pleasures and his ambition but if he once engrosses the commerce of the spanish indies whatever quantities of gold and silver stagnate in his private coffers there will be still enough to carry on the circulation among his subjects by this means in a short space of time he may heap up greater wealth than all the princes of europe joined together and in the present constitution of the world wealth and power are but different names for the same thing let us therefore suppose that after eight or ten years of peace he has a mind to infringe any of his treaties or invade a neighboring state to revive the pretensions of spain upon portugal or attempt the taking those places which were granted us for our security what resistance what opposition can we make to so formidable an enemy should the same alliance rise against him that is now in war with him what could we hope for from it at a time when the states engaged in it will be comparatively weakened and the enemy who is now able to keep them at a stand will have received so many new accessions of strength  but i think it is not to be imagined that in such a conjuncture as we here suppose the same confederates or any other of equal force could be prevailed upon to join their arms and endeavor at the pulling down so exorbitant a power some might be bought into his interests by money others drawn over by fear and those that are liable to neither of these impressions might not think their own interest so much concerned as in the present war or if any appeared in a disposition to enter into such a confederacy they might be crushed separately before they could concert measures for their mutual defense  the keeping together of the present alliance can be ascribed to nothing else but the clear and evident conviction which every member of it is under that if it should once break without having had its effect they can never hope for another opportunity of reuniting or of prevailing by all the joint efforts of such an union let us therefore agree on this as a fixed rule and an inviolable maxim never to lay down our arms against france till we have utterly disjoined her from the spanish monarchy let this be the first step of a public treaty the basis of a general peace  had the present war indeed run against us and all our attacks upon the enemy been vain it might look like a degree of frenzy or a mixture of obstinacy and despair to be determined on so impracticable an undertaking but on the contrary we have already done a great part of our work and are come within view of the end that we have been so long driving at we remain victorious in all the seats of war in flanders we have got into our hands several open countries rich towns and fortified places we have driven the enemy out of all his alliances dispossessed him of his strong holds and ruined his allies in germany we have not only recovered what the beginning of the war had taken from us but possessed ourselves of the kingdom of naples the duchy of milan and the avenue of france in italy the spanish war has given us a haven for our ships and the most populous and wealthy province of that kingdom in short we have taken all the outlying parts of the spanish monarchy and made impressions upon the very heart of it we have beaten the french from all their advanced posts in europe and driven them into their last entrenchments one vigorous push on all sides one general assault will force the enemy to cry out for quarter and surrender themselves at discretion another blenheim or ramillies will make the confederates masters of their own terms and arbitrators of a peace  but notwithstanding the advantages already gained are very considerable if we pursue them they will be of no effect unless we improve them toward the carrying of our main point the enemy staggers if you follow your blow he falls at your feet but if you allow him respite he will recover his strength and come upon you with greater fury we have given him several repeated wounds that have enfeebled him and brought him low but they are such as time will heal unless you take advantage from his present weakness to redouble your attacks upon him it was a celebrated part in caesars character and what comes home to our present purpose that he thought nothing at all was done while any thing remained undone in short we have been tugging a great while against the stream and have almost weathered our point a stretch or two more will do the work but if instead of that we slacken our arms and drop our oars we shall be hurried back in a moment to the place from whence we first set out  after having seen the necessity of an entire separation of the kingdoms of france and spain our subject naturally leads us into the consideration of the most proper means for effecting it  we have a great while flattered our selves with the prospect of reducing france to our own terms by the want of money among the people and the exigencies of the public treasury but have been still disappointed by the great sums imported from america and the many new expedients which the court has found out for its relief a long consumptive war is more likely to break the grand alliance than disable france from maintaining sufficient armies to oppose it an arbitrary government will never want money so long as the people have it and so active a people will always have it whilst they can send what merchandises they please to mexico and peru the french since their alliance with spain keep thirty ships in constant motion between the western ports of france and the south seas of america the king himself is an adventurer in this traffic and besides the share that he receives out of the gains of his subjects has immense sums that come directly from it into his own hands  we may further consider that the french since their abandoning bavaria and italy have very much retrenched the expense of the war and lay out among themselves all the money that is consumed in it  many are of opinion that the most probable way of bringing france to reason would be by the making an attempt upon the spanish west indies and by that means to cut off all communication with this great source of riches or turn the current of it into our own country this i must confess carries so promising an appearance that i would by no means discourage the attempt but at the same time i think it should be a collateral project rather than our principal design such an undertaking if well concerted and put into good hands would be of infinite advantage to the common cause but certainly an enterprise that carries in it the fate of europe should not turn upon the uncertainty of winds and waves and be liable to all the accidents that may befall a naval expedition  others there are that have long deceived themselves with the hopes of an insurrection in france and are therefore for laying out all our strength on a descent these i think do not enough consider the natural love which the gross of mankind have for the constitution of their fathers a man that is not enlightened by travel or reflection grows as fond of arbitrary power to which he has been used from his infancy as of cold climates or barren countries in which he has been born and bred besides there is a kind of sluggish resignation as well as poorness and degeneracy of spirit in a state of slavery that we meet with but very few who will be at the pains or danger of recovering themselves out of it as we find in history instances of persons who after their prisons have been flung open and their fetters struck off have chosen rather to languish in their dungeons than stake their miserable lives and fortunes upon the success of a revolution i need not instance the general fate of descents the difficulty of supplying men and provisions by sea against an enemy that has both at hand and without which it is impossible to secure those conquests that are often made in the first onsets of an invasion for these and other reasons i can never approve the nursing up commotions and insurrections in the enemys country which for want of the necessary support are likely to end in the massacre of our friends and the ruin of their families  the only means therefore for bringing france to our conditions and what appears to me in all human probability a sure and infallible expedient is to throw in multitudes upon them and overpower them with numbers would the confederacy exert it self as much to annoy the enemy as they themselves do for their defense we might bear them down with the weight of our armies and in one summer overset the whole power of france  the french monarchy is already exhausted of its best and bravest subjects the flower of the nation is consumed in its wars the strength of their armies consists at present of such as have saved themselves by flight from some or other of the victorious confederates and the only proper persons to recruit them are but the refuse of those who have been already picked out for the service marshall de vauban though infinitely partial in his calculations of the power of france reckons that the number of its inhabitants was two millions less at the peace of ryswick than in the beginning of the war that was there concluded and though that war continued nine years and this has as yet lasted but six yet considering that their armies are more strong and numerous that there has been much more action in the present war and that their losses sustained in it have been very extraordinary we may by a moderate computation suppose that the present war has not been less prejudicial than the foregoing one in the ravage which it has made among the people there is in france so great a disproportion between the number of males and females and among the former between those who are capable of bearing arms and such as are too young sickly or decrepit for the service and at the same time such vast numbers of ecclesiastics secular and religious who live upon the labors of others that when the several trades and professions are supplied you will find most of those that are proper for war absolutely necessary for filling up the laborious part of life and carrying on the underwork of the nation they have already contributed all their superfluous hands and every new levy they make must be at the expense of their farms and vineyards their manufactures and commerce  on the contrary the grand alliance have innumerable sources of recruits not only in britain and ireland the united provinces and flanders but in all the populous parts of germany that have little trade or manufactures in proportion to the number of their inhabitants we may add that the french have only switzerland besides their own country to recruit in and we know the difficulties they meet with in getting thence a single regiment whereas the allies have not only the same resource but may be supplied for money from denmark and other neutral states in short the confederates may bring to the field what forces they please if they will be at the charge of them but france let her wealth be what it will must content herself with the product of her own country  the french are still in greater streights for supplies of horse than men the breed of their country is neither so good nor numerous as what are to be found in most of the countries of the allies they had last summer about threescore thousand in their several armies and could not perhaps bring into the field thirty thousand more if they were disposed to make such an augmentation  the french horse are not only few but weak in comparison of ours their cavalry in the battle of blenheim could not sustain the shock of the british horse for this reason our late way of attacking their troops sword in hand is very much to the advantage of our nation as our men are more robust and our horses of a stronger make than the french and in such attacks it is the weight of the forces supposing equal courage and conduct that will always carry it the english strength turned very much to account in our wars against the french of old when we used to gall them with our long bows at a greater distance than they could shoot their arrows this advantage we lost upon the invention of firearms but by the present method our strength as well as bravery may again be of use to us in the day of battle  we have very great encouragement to send what numbers we are able into the field because our generals at present are such as are likely to make the best use of them without throwing them away on any fresh attempts or illconcerted projects the confederate armies have the happiness of being commanded by persons who are esteemed the greatest leaders of the present age and are perhaps equal to any that have preceded them there is a sort of resemblance in their characters a particular sedateness in their conversation and behavior that qualifies them for council with a great intrepidity and resolution that fits them for action they are all of them men of concealed fire that does not break out with noise and heat in the ordinary circumstances of life but shows it self sufficiently in all great enterprises that require it it is true the general upon the rhine has not had the same occasions as the others to signalize himself but if we consider the great vigilance activity and courage with the consummate prudence and the nice sense of honor which appears in that princes character we have great reason to hope that as he purchased the first success in the present war by forcing into the service of the confederates an army that was raised against them in the very heart of the empire he will give one of the finishing strokes to it and help to conclude the great work which he so happily begun the sudden check that he gave to the french army the last campaign and the good order he established in that of the germans look like happy presages of what we may expect from his conduct i shall not pretend to give any character of the generals on the enemies side but i think we may say this that in the eyes of their own nation they are inferior to several that have formerly commanded the french armies if then we have greater numbers than the french and at the same time better generals it must be our own fault if we will not reap the fruit of such advantages  it would be loss of time to explain any farther our superiority to the enemy in numbers of men and horse we see plainly that we have the means in our hands and that nothing but the application of them is wanting let us only consider what use the enemy would make of the advantage we have mentioned if it fell on their side and is it not very strange that we should not be as active and industrious for our security as they would certainly be for our destruction but before we consider more distinctly the method we ought to take in the prosecution of the war under this particular view let us reflect a little upon those we have already taken in the course of it for these six years past  the allies after a successful summer are too apt upon the strength of it to neglect their preparations for the ensuing campaign while the french leave no art nor stratagem untried to fill up the empty spaces of their armies and swell them to an equal bulk with those of the confederates by this means our advantage is lost and the fate of europe brought to a second decision it is now become an observation that we are to expect a very indifferent year after a very successful one blenheim was followed by a summer that makes no noise in the war ramillies turin and barcelona were the parents of our last campaign so many dreadful blows alarmed the enemy and raised their whole country up in arms had we on our side made proportionable preparations the war by this time had been brought to a happy issue if after having gained the great victories of blenheim and ramillies we had made the same efforts as we should have done had we lost them the power of france could not have withstood us  in the beginning of the winter we usually get what intelligence we can of the force which the enemy intends to employ in the campaigns of the succeeding year and immediately cast about for a sufficient number of troops to face them in the field of battle this i must confess would be a good method if we were engaged in a defensive war we might maintain our ground with an equal number of forces but our business is not only to secure what we are already in possession of we are to wrest the whole spanish monarchy out of the hands of the enemy and in order to it to work our way into the heart of his country by dint of arms we should therefore put forth all our strength and without having an eye to his preparations make the greatest push that we are able on our own side we are told that the enemy at present thinks of raising threescore thousand men for the next summer if we regulate our levies in that view we do nothing let us perform our utmost as they do and we shall overwhelm them with our multitudes we have it in our power at least to be four times as strong as the french but if ten men are in war with forty and the latter detach only an equal number to the engagement what benefit do they receive from their superiority  it seems therefore to be the business of the confederates to turn to their advantage their apparent odds in men and horse and by that means to outnumber the enemy in all rencounters and engagements for the same reason it must be for the interest of the allies to seek all opportunities of battle because all losses on the opposite side are made up with infinitely more difficulty than on ours besides that the french do their business by lying still and have no other concern in the war than to hold fast what they have already got into their hands  the miscarriage of the noblest project that ever was formed in europe can be ascribed to nothing else but our want of numbers in the several quarters of the war if our armies on all sides had begun to busy and insult the enemy at the same time that the forces marched out of piemont toulon had been at present in the hands of the duke of savoy but could that prince ever have imagined that the french would have been at liberty to detach whole armies against him or will it appear credible to posterity that in a war carried on by the joint force of so many populous and powerful nations france could send so great a part of its troops to one seat of the war without suffering in any of the rest whereas it is well known that if the duke of savoy had continued before toulon eight days longer he had been attacked by an army of sixty thousand men which was more than double the number of his own and yet the enemy was strong enough every where else to prevent the confederates from making any impression upon them however let us fall into the right measures and we may hope that the stroke is only deferred the duke of savoy has secured a passage into dauphiny and if the allies make such efforts in all parts as we may reasonably expect from them that prince may still make himself master of the french dominions on the other side of the rhone  there is another part of our conduct which may perhaps deserve to be considered as soon as we have agreed with the states general upon any augmentation of our forces we immediately negotiate with some or other of the german princes who are in the same confederacy to furnish out our quota in mercenaries this may be doubly prejudicial to the alliance first as it may have an ill influence on the resolutions of those princes in the diet of the empire who may be willing to settle as small a quota as they can for themselves that they may have more troops to hire out and in the next place as it may hinder them from contributing the whole quota which they have settled this actually happened in the last campaign when we are told the germans excused themselves for their want of troops upon the rhine as having already put most of their forces into the british and dutch service such an excuse indeed is very unjust but it would be better to give them no occasion of making it and on such occasions to consider what men are apt to do as well as what they may do with reason  it might therefore be for our advantage that all the foreign troops in the british pay should be raised in neutral countries switzerland in particular if timely applied to might be of great use to us no only in respect of the reinforcements which we might draw from thence but because such a draught of forces would lessen the number of those that might otherwise be employed in the french service the bulk of our levies should nevertheless be raised in our own country it being impossible for neutral states to furnish both the british and dutch with a sufficient number of effective men besides that the british soldiers will be more at the disposal of their general and act with greater vigor under the conduct of one for whom they have so just a value and whom they do not consider only as their leader but as their countryman we may likewise suppose that the soldiers of a neutral state who are not animated by any national interest cannot fight for pay with the same ardour and alacrity as men that fight for their prince and country their wives and children  it may likewise be worth while to consider whether the military genius of the english nation may not fall by degrees and become inferior to that of our neighboring states if it has no occasion to exert it self minds that are altogether set on trade and profit often contract a certain narrowness of temper and at length become incapable of great and generous resolutions should the french ever make an unexpected descent upon us we might want soldiers of our own growth to rise up in our defense and might not have time to draw a sufficient number of troops to our relief from the remote corners of germany it is generally said that if king charles ii had made war upon france in the beginning of his reign he might have conquered it by the many veterans which were scattered up and down this kingdom and had been inured to service in the civil wars it is to be hoped we shall never have such another nursery of soldiers but if the present war gives a more military turn to all other nations of europe than to our own it is to be feared we may lose in strength what we gain in number we may apply the same consideration nearer home if all our levies are made in scotland or ireland may not those two parts of the british monarchy after the disbanding of the present army be too powerful for the rest in case of a revolt though god be thanked we are not in any danger of one at present however as these considerations do not concern the more essential part of our design it is sufficient to have mentioned them  the sparing of our selves in so important a conjuncture when we have but this single opportunity left for the preserving every thing that is precious amongst us is the worst sort of management that we can possibly fall into the good husbandry of one age may intail an endless expense upon all posterity we must venture the sacrificing a part of our lives and fortunes at present if we will effectually secure both for the future the british kingdom is so well stocked with people and so much abounds in horse that we have power enough in our own hands did we make our outmost use of it to humble france and in a campaign or two to put an end to the war  there is not a more disagreeable thought to the people of great britain than that of a standing army but if a peace be made before the disunion of france and spain there are few perhaps that will not think the maintaining a settled body of numerous forces indispensable for the safety of our country we have it therefore in our choice to raise such a strong reinforcement of troops as at present may be sufficient in conjunction with those of the allies for breaking the strength of the enemy or when the peace is concluded to keep on foot such an army as will be necessary for preventing his attempts upon us  it is to be hoped that those who would be the most zealous against keeping up a constant body of regular troops after a general peace will the most distinguish themselves for the promoting an augmentation of those which are now on foot and by that means take care that we shall not stand in need of such an expedient  we are indeed obliged by the present situation of our affairs to bring more troops into the field than we have yet done as the french are retired within their lines and have collected all their strength into a narrow compass we must have greater numbers to charge them in their intrenchments and force them to a battle we saw the last campaign that an army of fourscore thousand of the best troops in europe with the duke of marlborough at the head of them could do nothing against an enemy that were too numerour to be assaulted in their camps or attacked in their strong holds  there is another consideration which deserves our utmost attention we know very well that there is a prince at the head of a powerful army who may give a turn to the war in which we are engaged if he thinks fit to side with either party i cannot presume to guess how far our ministers may be informed of his designs but unless they have very strong assurances of his falling in with the grand alliance or not opposing it they cannot be too circumspect and speedy in taking their precautions against any contrary resolution we shall be unpardonable if after such an expense of blood and treasure we leave it in the power of any single prince to command a peace and make us accept what conditions he thinks fit it is certain according to the posture of our affairs in the last campaign this prince could have turned the balance on either side but it is to be hoped the liberties of europe will not depend any more on the determination of one mans will i do not speak this because i think there is any appearance of that princes uniting himself to france on the contrary as he has an extraordinary zeal for the reformed religion and great sentiments of honor i think it is not improbable we should draw him over to the confederacy if we press him to it by proper motives his love for religion and his sense of glory will both have their effect on a prince who has already distinguished himself by being a patron of protestants and guarantee of the westphalian treaty and if his interest has any part in his actions the allies may make him greater offers than the french king can do in the present conjuncture there are large extents of dominion in the forfeited principalities of the empire doubtful successions to which the king of sweden seems to have very just pretensions and at the same time a great title not yet disposed of and a seat of war on the moselle where none of our generals have signalized themselves it would be presumption to be particular in any proposals on such an occasion it is enough to have shown in general that there are fair opportunities of which the wisdom of the confederates may make use  common sense will direct us when we see so warlike a prince at the head of so great an army hovering on the borders of our confederates either to obtain his friendship or secure our selves against the force of his arms we are sure whatever numbers of troops we raise we shall have no hands but what will turn to account nay we are certain that extraordinary funds and augmentations for one or two campaigns may spare us the expense of many years and put an end to axes and levies for a whole age whereas a long parsimonious war will drain us of more men and money and in the end may prove ineffectual  there is still a great popular objection which will be made to every thing that can be urged on this subject and indeed it is such a one as falls so much in with the prejudices and little passions of the multitude that when it is turned and set off to advantage by illdesigning men it throws a damp on the public spirit of the nation and gives a check to all generous resolutions for its honor and safety in short we are to be told that england contributes much more than any other of the allies and that therefore it is not reasonable she should make any addition to her present efforts if this were true in fact i do not see any tolerable color for such a conclusion supposing among a multitude embarked in the same vessel there are several that in the fury of a tempest will rather perish than work for their preservation would it not be madness in the rest to stand idle and rather choose to sink together than do more than comes to their share since we are engaged in a work so absolutely necessary for our welfare the remissness of our allies should be an argument for us to redouble our endeavors rather than slacken them if we must govern our selves by example let us rather imitate the vigilance and activity of the common enemy than the supineness and negligence of our friends  we have indeed a much greater share in the war than any other part of the confederacy the french king makes at us directly keeps a king by him to set over us and has very lately augmented the salary of his court to let us see how much he has that design at his heart few of the nations in war with him should they ever fall into his hands would lose their religion or form of government or interfere at present with him in matters of commerce the dutch who are likely to be the greatest losers after the britains have but little trade to the levant in comparison with ours have no considerable plantations or commerce in the west indies or any woollenmanufactures for spain not to mention the strong barrier they have already purchased between france and their own country  but after all every nation in the confederacy makes the same complaint and fancies it self the greatest sufferer by the war indeed in to common a pressure let the weight be never so equally distributed every one will be most sensible of that part which lies on his own shoulders we furnish without dispute more than any other branch of the alliance but the question is whether others do not exert themselves in proportion according to their respective strength the emperor the king of prussia the elector of hanover as well as the states of holland and the duke of savoy seem at least to come up to us the greatest powers in germany are borrowing money where they can get it in order to maintain their stated quotas and go thorough their part of the expense and if any of the circles have been negligent they have paid for it much more in their late contributions than what would have furnished out their shares in the common charges of the war  there are others who will object the poverty of the nation and the difficulties it would find in furnishing greater supplies to the war than it does at present to this we might answer that if the nation were really as poor as this objection makes it it should be an argument for enforcing rather than diminishing our present efforts against france the sinking our taxes for a few years would be only a temporary relief and in a little time occasion far greater impositions than those which are now laid upon us whereas the seasonable expense of part of our riches will not only preserve the rest but by the right use of them procure vast additions to our present stock it may be necessary for a person languishing under an ill habit of body to lose several ounces of blood notwithstanding it will weaken him for a time in order to put a new ferment into the remaining mass and draw into it fresh supplies  but we can by no means make this concession to those who so industriously publish the nations poverty our country is not only rich but abounds in wealth much more than any other of the same extent in europe france notwithstanding the goodness of its climate the fertility of its soil the multitude of its inhabitants its convenient harbors both for the ocean and mediterranean and its present correspondence with the west indies is not to compare with great britain in this particular i shall transcribe word for word the passage of a late celebrated french author which will lay this matter in its full light and leave the reader to make the counterpart of the parallel between the two nations  according to all the inquiries that i have been able to make during several years in which i have applied my self to this sort of remarks i have observed that about a tenth part of the people of this kingdom are reduced to beggary and are actual beggars that among the nine other parts five are not in a condition to give alms or relief to those aforementioned being very near reduced themselves to the same miserable condition of the four other remaining parts three are very uneasy in their circumstances and embarrassed with debts and lawsuits in the tenth part i reckon the soldiers lawyers ecclesiastics merchants and substantial citizens which cannot make up more than a hundred thousand families and i believe i should not be mistaken if i should say that there are not above ten thousand of these families who are very much at their ease and if out of these ten thousand we should take the men that are employed in public business with their dependents and adherents as also those whom the king supports by his bounty with a few merchants the number of those who remain will be surprizingly little dixme royale  what a dreadful account is this of nineteen millions of people for so many the author reckons in that kingdom how can we see such a multitude of souls cast under so many subdivisions of misery without reflecting on the absurdity of a form of government that sacrifices the ease and happiness of so many reasonable beings to the glory of one of their fellow creatures but this is not our affair at present  if we run over the other nations of europe that have any part in the present war we shall only pass through so many different scenes of poverty spain portugal and savoy are reduced to great extremities germany is exhausted to the last degree in many parts of it and in others plundered of all she had left holland indeed flourishes above the rest in wealth and plenty but if we consider the infinite industry and penuriousness of that people the coarseness of their food and raiment their little indulgences of pleasure and excess it is no wonder that notwithstanding they furnish as great taxes as their neighbors they make a better figure under them in a common wealth there are not so many overgrown estates as in monarchies the wealth of the country is so equally distributed that most of the community are at their ease though few are placed in extraordinary points of splendour and magnificence but notwithstanding these circumstances may very much contribute to the seeming prosperity of the united provinces we know they are indebted many millions more than their whole republic is worth and if we consider the variety of taxes and impositions they groan under at a time when their private dissentions run high and some of the wealthiest parts of the government refuse to bear their share in the public expense we shall not think the condition of that people so much to be envied as some amongst us would willingly represent it  nor is great britain only rich as she stands in comparison with other states but is really so in her own intrinsic wealth she had never more ships at sea greater quantities of merchandise in her warehouses larger receipts of customs or more numerous commodities rising out of her manufactures than she has at present in short she sits in the midst of a mighty affluence of all the necessaries and conveniences of life if our silver and gold diminishes our public credit continues unimpaired and if we are in want of bullion it lies in our own power to supply our selves the old roman general when he heard his army complain of thirst showed them the springs and rivers that lay behind the enemys camp it is our own case the rout of a spanish army would make us masters of the indies  if prince eugene takes upon him the command of the confederate forces in catalonia and meets with that support from the alliance which they are capable of giving him we have a fair prospect of reducing spain to the entire obedience of the house of austria the silesian fund to the immortal reputation of those generous patriots who were concerned in it enabled that prince to make a conquest of italy at a time when our affairs were more desperate there than they are at present in the kingdom of spain  when our parliament has done their utmost another publickspirited project of the same nature which the common enemy could not foresee nor prepare against might in all probability set king charles upon the throne for which he has so long contended one pitched battle would determine the fate of the spanish continent  let us therefore exert the united strength of our whole island and by that means put a new life and spirit into the confederates who have their eyes fixed upon us and will abate or increase their preparations according to the example that s set them we see the necessity of an augmentation if we intend to bring the enemy to reason or rescue our country from the miseries that may befall it and we find our selves in a condition of making such an augmentation as by the blessing of god cannot but prove effectual if we carry it on vigorously we shall gain for our selves and our posterity a long a glorious and a lasting peace but if we neglect so fair an opportunity we may be willing to employ all our hands and all our treasures when it will be too late and shall be tormented with one of the most melancholy reflections of an afflicted heart that it was once in our power to have made our selves and our children happy  of the christian religion  of the christian religion section i i general division of the following discourse with regard to pagan and jewish authors who mention particulars relating to our savior  ii not probable that any such should be mentioned by pagan writers who lived at the same time from the nature of such transactions  iii especially when related by the jews  iv and heard at a distance by those who pretended to as great miracles as their own  v besides that no pagan writers of that age lived in judaea or its confines  vi and because many books of that age are lost  vii an instance of one record proved to be authentic  viii a second record of probable though not undoubted authority  i that i may lay before you a full state of the subject under our consideration and methodize the several particulars that i touched upon in discourse with you i shall first take notice of such pagan authors as have given their testimony to the history of our savior reduce these authors under their respective classes and show what authority their testimonies carry with them secondly i shall take notice of jewish authors in the same light  ii there are many reasons why you should not expect that matters of such a wonderful nature should be taken notice of by those eminent pagan writers who were contemporaries with jesus christ or by those who lived before his disciples had personally appeared among them and ascertained the report which had gone abroad concerning a life so full of miracles  supposing such things had happened at this day in switzerland or among the grisons who make a greter figure in europe than judaea did in the roman empire would they be immediately believed by those who live at a great distance from them or would any certain account of them be transmitted into foreign countries within so short a space of time as that of our saviors public ministry such kinds of news though never so true seldom gain credit till some time after they are transacted and exposed to the examination of the curious who by laying together circumstances attestations and characters of those who are concerned in them either receive or reject what at first none but eyewitnesses could absolutely believe or disbelieve in a case of this sort it was natural for men of sense and learning to treat the whole account as fabulous or at farthest to suspend their belief of it until all things stood together in their full light  iii besides the jews were branded not only for superstitions different from all the religions of the pagan world but in a particular manner ridiculed for being a credulous people so that whatever reports of such a nature came out of that country were looked upon by the heathen world as false frivolous and improbable  iv we may further observe that the ordinary practice of magic in those times with the many pretended prodigies divinations apparitions and local miracles among the heathens made them less attentive to such news from judaea till they had time to consider the nature the occasion and the end of our saviors miracles and were awakened by many surprising events to allow them any consideration at all  v we are indeed told by st matthew that the fame of our savior during his life went throughout all syria and that there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee judaea decapolis idumaea from beyond jordan and from tire and sidon now had there been any historians of those times and places we might have expected to have seen in them some account of those wonderful transactions in judaea but there is not any single author extant in any kind of that age in any of those countries  vi how many books have perished in which possibly there might have been mention of our savior look among the romans how few of their writings are come down to our times in the space of two hundred years from our saviors birth when there was such a multitude of writers in all kinds how small is the number of authors that have made their way to the present age  vii one authentic record and that the most authentic heathen record we are pretty sure is lost i mean the account sent by the governor of judaea under whom our savior was judged condemned and crucified it was the custom in the roman empire as it is to this day in all the governments of the world for the praefects and viceroys of distant provinces to transmit to their sovereign a summary relation of every thing remarkable in their administration that pontius pilate in his account would have touched on so extraordinary an event in judaea is not to be doubted and that he actually did we learn from justin martyr who lived about a hundred years after our saviors death resided made converts and suffered martyrdom at rome where he was engaged with philosophers and in a particular manner with crescens the cynick who could easily have detected and would not fail to have exposed him had he quoted a record not in being or made any false citation out of it would the great apologist have challenged crescens to dispute the cause of christianity with him before the roman senate had he forged such an evidence or would crescens have refused the challenge could he have triumphed over him in the detection of such a forgery to which we must add that the apology which appeals to this record was presented to a learned emperor and to the whole body of the roman senate this father in his apology speaking of the death and suffering of our savior refers the emperor for the truth of what he says to the acts of pontius pilate which i have here mentioned tertullian who wrote his apology about fifty years after justin doubtless referred to the same record when he tells the governor of rome that the emperor tiberius having received an account out of palestine in syria of the divine person who had appeared in that country paid him a particular regard and threatened to punish any who should accuse the christians nay that the emperor would have adopted him among the deities whom they worshipped had not the senate refused to come into his proposal tertullian who gives us this history was not only one of the most learned men of his age but what adds a greater weight to his authority in this case was eminently skilful and well read in the laws of the roman empire nor can it be said that tertullian grounded his quotation upon the authority of justin martyr because we find he mixes it with matters of fact which are not related by that author eusebius mentions the same ancient record but as it was not extant in his time i shall not insist upon his authority in this point if it be objected that this particular is not mentioned in any roman historian i shall use the same argument in a parallel case and see whether it will carry any force with it ulpian the great roman lawyer gathered together all the imperial edicts that had been made against the christians but did any one ever say that there had been no such edicts because they were not mentioned in the histories of those emperors besides who knows but this circumstance of tiberius was mentioned in other historians that have been lost though not to be found in any still extant has not suetonius many particulars of this emperor omitted by tacitus and herodian many that are not so much as hinted at by either as for the spurious acts of pilate now extant we know the occasion and time of their writing and that had there not been a true and authentic record of this nature they would never have been forged  viii the story of agbarus king of edessa relating to the letter which he sent to our savior and to that which he received from him is a record of great authority and though i will not insist upon it may venture to say that had we such an evidence for any fact in pagan history an author would be thought very unreasonable who should reject it i believe you will be of my opinion if you will peruse with other authors who have appeared in vindication of these letters as genuine the additional arguments which have been made use of by the late famous and learned dr grabe in the second volume of his spicilegium  section ii i what facts in the history of our savior might be taken notice of by pagan authors  ii what particular facts are taken notice of and by what pagan authors  iii how celsus represented our saviors miracles  iv the same representation made of them by other unbelievers and proved unreasonable  v what facts in our saviors history not to be expected from pagan writers  i we now come to consider what undoubted authorities are extant among pagan writers and here we must premise that some parts of our saviors history may be reasonably expected from pagans i mean such parts as might be known to those who lived at a distance from judaea as well as to those who were the followers and eyewitnesses of christ  ii such particulars are most of these which follow and which are all attested by some one or other of those heathen authors who lived in or near the age of our savior and his disciples that augustus caesar had ordered the whole empire to be censed or taxed which brought our saviors reputed parents to bethlehem this is mentioned by several roman historians as tacitus suetonius and dion that a great light or a new star appeared in the east which directed the wise men to our savior this is recorded by chalcidius that herod the king of palestine so often mentioned in the roman history made a great slaughter of innocent children being so jealous of his successor that he put to death his own sons on that account this character of him is given by several historians and this cruel fact mentioned by macrobius a heathen author who tells it as a known thing without any mark of doubt upon it that our savior had been in egypt this celsus though he raises a monstrous story upon it is so far from denying that he tells us our savior learned the arts of magic in that country that pontius pilate was governor of judaea that our savior was brought in judgment before him and by him condemned and crucified this is recorded by tacitus that many miraculous cures and works out of the ordinary course of nature were wrought by him this is confessed by julian the apostate porphyry and hierocles all of them not only pagans but professed enemies and persecutors of christianity that our savior foretold several things which came to pass according to his predictions this was attested by phlegon in his annals as we are assured by the learned origin against celsus that at the time when our savior died there was a miraculous darkness and a great earthquake this is recorded by the same phlegon the trallian who was likewise a pagan and freeman to adrian the emperor we may here observe that a native of trallium which was not situate at so great a distance from palestine might very probably be informed of such remarkable events as had passed among the jews in the age immediately preceding his own times since several of his countrymen with whom he had conversed might have received a confused report of our savior before his crucifixion and probably lived within the shake of the earthquake and the shadow of the eclipse which are recorded by this author that christ was worshipped as a god among the christians that they would rather suffer death than blaspheme him that they received a sacrament and by it entered into a vow of abstaining from sin and wickedness conformable to the advice given by st paul that they had private assemblies of worship and used to join together in hymns this is the account which pliny the younger gives of christianity in his days about seventy years after the death of christ and which agrees in all its circumstances with the accounts we have in holy writ of the first state of christianity after the crucifixion of our blessed savior that st peter whose miracles are many of them recorded in holy writ did many wonderful works is owned by julian the apostate who therefore represents him as a great magician and one who had in his possession a book of magical secrets left him by our savior that the devils or evil spirits were subject to them we may learn from porphyry who objects to christianity that since jesus had begun to be worshipped aesculapius and the rest of the gods did no more converse with men nay celsus himself affirms the same thing in effect when he says that the power which seemed to reside in christians proceeded from the use of certain names and the invocation of certain demons origin remarks on this passage that the author doubtless hints at those christians who put to flight evil spirits and healed those who were possessed with them a fact which had been often seen and which he himself had seen as he declares in another part of his discourse against celsus but at the same time he assures us that this miraculous power was exerted by the use of no other name but that of jesus to which were added several passages in his history but nothing like any invocation to demons  iii celsus was so hard set with the report of our saviors miracles and the confident attestations concerning him that though he often intimates he did not believe them to be true yet knowing he might be silenced in such an answer provides himself with another retreat when beated out of this namely that our savior was a magician thus he compares the feeding of so many thousands at two different times with a few loaves and fishes to the magical feasts of those egyptian impostors who would present their spectators with visionary entertainments that had in them neither substance nor reality which by the way is to suppose that a hungry and fainting multitude were filled by an apparition or strengthened and refreshed with shadows he knew very well that there were so many witnesses and actors if i may call them such in these two miracles that it was impossible to refute such multitudes who had doubtless sufficiently spread the fame of them and was therefore in this place forced to resort to the other solution that it was done by magic it was not enough to say that a miracle which appeared to so many thousand eyewitnesses was a forgery of christs disciples and therefore supposing them to be eyewitnesses he endeavors to show how they might be deceived  iv the unconverted heathens who were pressed by the many authorities that confirmed our saviors miracles as well as the unbelieving jews who had actually seen them were driven to account for them after the same manner for to work by magic in the heathen way of speaking was in the language of the jews to cast out devils by beelzebub the prince of the devils our savior who knew that unbelievers in all ages would put this perverse interpretation on his miracles has branded the malignity of those men who contrary to the dictates of their own hearts started such an unreasonable objection as a blasphemy against the holy ghost and declared not only the guilt but the punishment of so black a crime at the same time he condescended to show the vanity and emptiness of this objection against his miracles by representing that they evidently tended to the destruction of those powers to whose assistance the enemies of his doctrine then ascribed them an argument which if duly weighed renders the objection so very frivolous and groundless that we may venture to call it even blasphemy against common sense would magic endeavor to draw off the minds of men from the worship which was paid to stocks and stones to give them an abhorrence of those evil spirits who rejoiced in the most cruel sacrifices and in offerings of the greatest impurity and in short to call upon mankind to exert their whole strength in the love and adoration of that one being from whom they derived their existence and on whom only they were taught to depend every moment for the happiness and continuance of it was it the business of magic to humanize our natures with compassion forgiveness and all the instances of the most extensive charity would evil spirits contribute to make men sober chaste and temperate and in a word to produce that reformation which was wrought in the moral world by those doctrines of our savior that received their sanction from his miracles nor is it possible to imagine that evil spirits would enter into a combination with our savior to cut off all their correspondence and intercourse with mankind and to prevent any for the future from addicting themselves to those rites and ceremonies which had done them so much honor we see the early effect which christianity had on the minds of men in this particular by that number of books which were filled with the secrets of magic and made a sacrifice to christianity by the converts mentioned in the acts of the apostles we have likewise an eminent instance of the inconsistency of our religion with magic in the history of the famous aquila this person who was a kinsman of the emperor trajan and likewise a man of great learning notwithstanding he had embraced christianity could not be brought off from the studies of magic by the repeated admonitions of his fellow christians so that at length they expelled him their society as rather choosing to lose the reputation of so considerable a proselyte than communicate with one who dealt in such dark and infernal practices besides we may observe that all the favorers of magic were the most professed and bitter enemies to the christian religion not to mention simon magus and many others i shall only take notice of those two great persecutors of christianity the emperors adrian and julian the apostate both them initiated in the mysteries of divination and skilled in all the depths of magic i shall only add that evil spirits cannot be supposed to have concurred in the establishment of a religion which triumphed over them drove them out of the places they possessed and divested them of their influence on mankind nor would i mention this particular though it be unanimously reported by all the ancient christian authors did it not appear from the authorities above cited that this was a fact confessed by heathens themselves  v we now see what a multitude of pagan testimonies may be produced for all those remarkable passages which might have been expected from them and indeed of several that i believe do more than answer your expectation as they were not subjects in their own nature so exposed to public notoriety it cannot be expected they should mention particulars which were transacted amongst the disciples only or among some few even of the disciples themselves such as the transfiguration the agony in the garden the appearance of christ after his resurrection and others of the like nature it was impossible for a heathen author to relate these things because if he had believed them he would no longer have been a heathen and by that means his testimony would not have been thought of so much validity besides his very report of facts so favorable to christianity would have prompted men to say that he was probably tainted with their doctrine we have a parallel case in hecataeus a famous greek historian who had several passages in his book conformable to the history of the jewish writers which when quoted by josephus as a confirmation of the jewish history when his heathen adversaries could give no other answer to it they would need suppose that hecataeus was a jew in his heart though they had no other reason for it but because his history gave greater authority to the jewish than the egyptian records  section iii i introduction to a second list of pagan authors who give testimony of our savior  ii a passage concerning our savior from a learned athenian  iii his conversion from paganism to christianity makes his evidence stronger than if he had continued a pagan  iv of another athenian philosopher converted to christianity  v why their conversion instead of weakening strengthens their evidence in defense of christianity  vi their belief in our saviors history founded at first upon the principles of historical faith  vii their testimonies extended to all the particulars of our saviors history  viii as related by the four evangelists  i to this list of heathen writers who make mention of our savior or touch upon any particulars of his life i shall add those authors who were at first heathens and afterward concerted to christianity upon which account as i shall here show their testimonies are to be looked upon as the more authentic and in this list of evidences i shall confine my self to such learned pagans as came over to christianity in the three first centuries because those were the times in which men had the best means of informing themselves of the truth of our saviors history and because among the great number of philosophers who came in afterward under the reigns of christian emperors there might be several who did it partly out of worldly motives  ii let us now suppose that a learned heathen writer who lived within  0 years of our saviors crucifixion after having shown that false miracles were generally wrought in obscurity and before few or no witnesses speaking of those which were wrought by our savior has the following passage but his works were always seen because they were true they were seen by those who were healed and by those who were raised from the dead nay these persons who were thus healed and raised were seen not only at the time of their being healed and raised but long afterward nay they were seen not only all the while our savior was upon earth but survived after his departure out of this world nay some of them were living in our days  iii i dare say you would look upon this as a glorious attestation for the cause of christianity had it come from the hand of a famous athenian philosopher these forementioned words however are actually the words of one who lived about sixty years after our saviors crucifixion and was a famous philosopher in athens but it will be said he was a convert to christianity now consider this matter impartially and see if his testimony is not much more valid for that reason had he continued a pagan philosopher would not the world have said that he was not sincere in what he writ or did not believe it for if so would not they have told us he would have embraced christianity this was indeed the case of this excellent man he had so thoroughly examined the truth of our saviors history and the excellency of that religion which he taught and was so entirely convinced of both that he became a proselyte and died a martyr  iv aristides was an athenian philosopher at the same time famed for his learning and wisdom but converted to christianity as it cannot be questioned that he perused and approved the apology of quadratus in which is the passage just now cited he joined with him in an apology of his own to the same emperor on the same subject this apology though now lost was extant in the time of ado viennensis a d   0 and highly esteemed by the most learned athenians as that author witnesses it must have contained great arguments for the truth of our saviors history because in it he asserted the divinity of our savior which could not but engage him in the proof of his miracles  v i do allow that generally speaking a man is not so acceptable and unquestioned an evidence in facts which make for the advancement of his own party but we must consider that in the case before us the persons to whom we appeal were of an opposite party till they were persuaded of the truth of those very facts which they report they bear evidence to a history in defense of christianity the truth of which history was their motive to embrace christianity they attest facts which they had heard while they were yet heathens and had they not found reason to believe them they would still have continued heathens and have made no mention of them in their writings  vi when a man is born under christian parents and trained up in the profession of that religion from a child he generally guides himself by the rules of christian faith in believing what is delivered by the evangelists but the learned pagans of antiquity before they became christians were only guided by the common rules of historical faith that is they examined the nature of the evidence which was to be met with in common fame tradition and the writings of those persons who related them together with the number concurrence veracity and private characters of those persons and being convinced upon all accounts that they had the same reason to believe the history of our savior as that of any other person to which they themselves were not actually eyewitnesses they were bound by all the rules of historical faith and of right reason to give credit to this history this they did accordingly and in consequence of it published the same truths themselves suffered many afflictions and very often death it self in the assertion of them when i say that an historical belief of the acts of our savior induced these learned pagans to embrace his doctrine i do not deny that there were many other motives which conduced to it as the excellency of his precepts the fulfilling of prophecies the miracles of his disciples the irreproachable lives and magnanimous sufferings of their followers with other considerations of the same nature but whatever other collateral arguments wrought more or less with philosophers of that age it is certain that a belief in the history of our savior was one motive with every new convert and that upon which all others turned as being the very basis and foundation of christianity  vii to this i must further add that as we have already seen many particular facts which are recorded in holy writ attested by particular pagan authors the testimony of those i am now going to produce extends to the whole history of our savior and to that continued series of actions which are related of him and his disciples in the books of the new testament  viii this evidently appears from their quotations out of the evangelists for the confirmation of any doctrine or account of our blessed savior nay a learned man of our nation who examined the writings of the most ancient fathers in another view refers to several passages in irenaeus tertullian clemens of alexandria origin and cyprian by which he plainly shows that each of these early writers ascribe to the four evangelists by name their respective histories so that there is not the least room for doubting of their belief in the history of our savior as recorded in the gospels i shall add that three of the five fathers here mentioned and probably four were pagans converted to christianity as they were all of them very inquisitive and deep in the knowledge of heathen learning and philosophy  section iv i character of the times in which the christian religion was propagated  ii and of many who embraced it  iii three eminent and early instances  iv multitudes of learned men who came over to it  v belief in our saviors history the first motive to their conversion  vi the names of several pagan philosophers who were christian converts  i it happened very providentially to the honor of the christian religion that it did not take its rise in the dark illiterate ages of the world but at a time when arts and sciences were at their height and when there were men who made it the business of their lives to search after truth and sift the several opinions of philosophers and wise men concerning the duty the end and chief happiness of reasonable creatures  ii several of these therefore when they had informed themselves of our saviors history and examined with unprejudiced minds the doctrines and manners of his disciples and followers were so struck and convinced that they professed themselves of that sect notwithstanding by this profession in that juncture of time they bid farewell to all the pleasures of this life renounced all the views of ambition engaged in an uninterrupted course of severities and exposed themselves to public hatred and contempt to sufferings of all kinds and to death itself  iii of this sort we may reckon those three early converts to christianity who each of them was a member of a senate famous for its wisdom and learning joseph the arimathean was of the jewish sanhedrim dionysius of the athenian areopagus and flavius clemens of the roman senate nay at the time of his death consul of rome these three were so thoroughly satisfied of the truth of the christian religion that the first of them according to all the reports of antiquity died a martyr for it as did the second unless we disbelieve aristides his fellowcitizen and contemporary and the third as we are informed both by roman and christian authors  iv among those innumerable multitudes who in most of the known nations of the world came over to christianity at its first appearance we may be sure there were great numbers of wise and learned men beside those whose names are in the christian records who without doubt took care to examine the truth of our saviors history before they would leave the religion of their country and of their forefathers for the sake of one that would not only cut them off from the allurements of this world but subject them to every thing terrible or disagreeable in it tertullian tells the roman governors that their corporations councils armies tribes companies the palace senate and courts of judicature were filled with christians as arnobius asserts that men of the finest parts and learning orators grammarians rhetoricians lawyers physicians philosophers despising the sentiments they had been once fond of took up their rest in the christian religion  v who can imagine that men of this character did not thoroughly inform themselves of the history of that person whose doctrines they embraced for however consonant to reason his precepts appeared how good soever were the effects which they produced in the world nothing could have tempted men to acknowledge him as their god and savior but their being firmly persuaded of the miracles he wrought and the many attestations of his divine mission which were to be met with in the history of his life this was the groundwork of the christian religion and if this failed the whole superstructure sunk with it this point therefore of the truth of our saviors history as recorded by the evangelists is every where taken for granted in the writings of those who from pagan philosophers became christian authors and who by reason of their conversion are to be looked upon as of the strongest collateral testimony for the truth of what is delivered concerning our savior  vi besides innumerable authors that are lost we have the undoubted names works or fragments of several pagan philosophers which show them to have been as learned as any unconverted heathen authors of the age in which the lived if we look into the greatest nurseries of learning in those ages of the world we find in athens dionysius quadratus aristides athenagoras and in alexandria dionysius clemens ammonius arnobius and anatolius to whom we may add origin for though his father was a christian martyr he became without all controversy the most learned and able philosopher of his age by his education at alexandria in that famous seminary of arts and sciences  section v i the learned pagans had means and opportunities of informing themselves of the truth of our saviors history  ii from the proceedings  iii the characters sufferings  iv and miracles of the persons who published it  v how these first apostles perpetuated their tradition by ordaining persons to succeed them  vi how their successors in the three first centuries preserved their tradition  vii that five generations might derive this tradition from christ to the end of the third century  viii four eminent christians that delivered it down successively to the year of our lord      ix the faith of the four abovementioned persons the same with that of the churches of the east of the west and of egypt  x another person added to them who brings us to the year     and that many other lists might be added in as direct and short a succession  xi why the tradition of the three first centuries more authentic than that of any other age proved from the conversation of the primitive christians  xii from the manner of initiating men into their religion  xiii from the correspondence between the churches  xiv from the long lives of several of christs disciples of which two instances  i it now therefore only remains to consider whether these learned men had means and opportunities of informing themselves of the truth of our saviors history for unless this point can be made out their testimonies will appear invalid and their enquiries ineffectual  ii as to this point we must consider that many thousands had seen the transactions of our savior in judaea and that many hundred thousands had received an account of them from the mouths of those who were actually eyewitnesses i shall only mention among these eyewitnesses the twelve apostles to whom we must add st paul who had a particular call to this high office though many other disciples and followers of christ had also their share in the publishing this wonderful history we learn from the ancient records of christianity that many of the apostles and disciples made it the express business of their lives traveled into the remotest parts of the world and in all places gathered multitudes about them to acquaint them with the history and doctrines of their crucified master and indeed were all christian records of these proceedings entirely lost as many have been the effect plainly evinces the truth of them for how else during the apostles lives could christianity have spread itself with such an amazing progress through the several nations of the roman empire how could it fly like lightning and carry conviction with it from one end of the earth to the other  iii heathens therefore of every age sex and quality born in the most different climates and bred up under the most different institutions when they saw men of plain sense without the help of learning armed with patience and courage instead of wealth pomp or power expressing in their lives those excellent doctrines of morality which they taught as delivered to them from our savior averring that they had seen his miracles during his life and conversed with him after his death when i say they saw no suspicion of falsehood treachery or worldly interest in their behavior and conversation and that they submitted to the most ignominious and cruel deaths rather than retract their testimony or even be silent in matters which they were to publish by their saviors especial command there was no reason to doubt of the veracity of those facts which they related or of the divine mission in which they were employed  iv but even these motives to faith in our savior would not have been sufficient to have brought about in so few years such an incredible number of conversions had not the apostles been able to exhibit still greater proofs of the truths which they taught a few persons of an odious and despised country could not have filled the world with believers had they not shown undoubted credentials from the divine person who sent them on such a message accordingly we are assured that they were invested with the power of working miracles which was the most short and the most convincing argument that could be produced and the only one that was adapted to the reason of all mankind to the capacities of the wise and ignorant and could overcome every cavil and every prejudice who would not believe that our savior healed the sick and raised the dead when it was published by those who themselves often did the same miracles in their presence and in his name could any reasonable person imagine that god almighty would arm men with such powers to authorize a lie and establish a religion in the world which was displeasing to him or that evil spirits would lend them such an effectual assistance to beat down vice and idolatry  v when the apostles had formed many assemblies in several parts of the pagan world who gave credit to the glad tidings of the gospel that upon their departure the memory of what they had related might not perish they appointed out of these new converts men of the best sense and of the most unblemished lives to preside over these several assemblies and to inculcate without ceasing what they had heard from the mouths of these eyewitnesses  vi upon the death of any of those substitutes to the apostles and disciples of christ his place was filled up with some other person of eminence for his piety and learning and generally a member of the same church who after his decease was followed by another in the same manner by which means the succession was continued in an uninterrupted line irenaeus informs us that every church preserved a catalogue of its bishops in the order that they succeeded one another and for an example produces a catalogue of those who governed the church of rome in that character which contains eight or nine persons though but at a very small remove from the times of the apostles  indeed the lists of bishops which are come down to us in other churches are generally filled with greater numbers than one would expect but the succession was quick in the three first centuries because the bishop very often ended in the martyr for when a persecution arose in any place the first fury of it fell upon this order of holy men who abundantly testified by their deaths and sufferings that they did not undertake these offices out of any temporal views that they were sincere and satisfied in the belief of what they taught and that they firmly adhered to what they had received from the apostles as laying down their lives in the same hope and upon the same principles none can be supposed so utterly regardless of their own happiness as to expire in torment and hazard their eternity to support any fables and inventions of their own or any forgeries of their predecessors who had presided in the same church and which might have been easily detected by the tradition of that particular church as well as by the concurring testimony of others to this purpose i think it is very remarkable that there was not a single martyr among those many heretics who disagreed with the apostolical church and introduced several wild and absurd notions into the doctrines of christianity they durst not stake their present and future happiness on their own chimerical imaginations and did not only shun persecution but affirmed that it was unnecessary for their followers to bear their religion through such fiery trials  vii we may fairly reckon that this first age of apostles and disciples with that second generation of many who were their immediate converts extended itself to the middle of the second century and that several of the third generation from these last mentioned which was but the fifth from christ continued to the end of the third century did we know the ages and numbers of the members in every particular church which was planted by the apostles i doubt not but in most of them there might be found five persons who in a continued series would reach through these three centuries of years that is till the    th from the death of our savior  viii among the accounts of those very few out of innumerable multitudes who had embraced christianity i shall single out four persons eminent for their lives their writings and their sufferings that were successively contemporaries and bring us down as far as to the year of our lord     st john who was the beloved disciple and conversed the most intimately with our savior lived till anno dom  00 polycarp who was the disciple of st john and had conversed with others of the apostles and disciples of our lord lived till anno dom     though his life was shortened by martyrdom irenaeus who was the disciple of polycarp and had conversed with many of the immediate disciples of the apostles lived at the lowest computation of his age till the year  0  when he was likewise cut off by martyrdom in which year the great origin was appointed regent of the catechetick school in alexandria and as he was the miracle of that age for industry learning and philosophy he was looked upon as the champion of christianity till the year     when if he did not suffer martyrdom as some think he did he was certainly actuated by the spirit of it as appears in the whole course of his life and writings nay he had often been put to the torture and had undergone trials worse than death as he conversed with the most eminent christians of his time in egypt and in the east brought over multitudes both from heresy and heathenism and left behind him several disciples of great fame and learning there is no question but there were considerable numbers of those who knew him and had been his hearers scholars or proselytes that lived till the end of the third century and to the reign of constantine the great  ix it is evident to those who read the lives and writings of polycarp irenaeus and origin that these three fathers believed the accounts which are given of our savior in the four evangelists and had undoubted arguments that not only st john but many others of our saviors disciples published the same accounts of him to which we must subjoin this further remark that what was believed by these fathers on this subject was likewise the belief of the main body of christians in those successive ages when they flourished since polycarp cannot but be looked upon if we consider the respect that was paid him as the representative of the eastern churches in this particular irenaeus of the western upon the same account and origin of those established in egypt  x to these i might add paul the famous hermit who retired from the decian persecution five or six years before origens death and lived till the year     i have only discovered one of those channels by which the history of our savior might be conveyed pure and unadulterated through those several ages that produced those pagan philosophers whose testimonies i make use of for the truth of our saviors history some or other of these philosophers came into the christian faith during its infancy in the several periods of these three first centuries when they had such means of informing themselves in all the particulars of our saviors history i must further add that though i have here only chosen this single link of martyrs i might find out others among those names which are still extant that delivered down this account of our savior in a successive tradition till the whole roman empire became christian as there is no question but numberless series of witnesses might follow one another in the same order and in as short a chain and that perhaps in every single church had the names and ages of the most eminent primitive christians have been transmitted to us with the like certainty  xi but to give this consideration more force we must take notice that the tradition of the first ages of christianity had several circumstances peculiar to it which made it more authentic than any other tradition in any other age of the world the christians who carried their religion through so many general and particular persecutions were incessantly comforting and supporting one another with the example and history of our savior and his apostles it was the subject not only of their solemn assemblies but of their private visits and conversations our virgins says tatian who lived in the second century discourse over their distaffs on divine subjects indeed when religion was woven into the civil government and flourished under the protection of the emperors mens thoughts and discourses were as they are now full of secular affairs but in the three first centuries of christianity men who embraced this religion had given up all their interests in this world and lived in a perpetual preparation for the next as not knowing how soon they might be called to it so that they had little else to talk of but the life and doctrines of that divine person which was their hope their encouragement and their glory we cannot therefore imagine that there was a single person arrived at any degree of age or consideration who had not heard and repeated above a thousand times in his life all the particulars of our saviors birth life death resurrection and ascension  xii especially if we consider that they could not then be received as christians till they had undergone several examinations persons of riper years who flocked daily into the church during the three first centuries were obliged to pass through many repeated instructions and give a strict account of their proficiency before they were admitted to baptism and as for those who were born of christian parents and had been baptized in their infancy they were with the like care prepared and disciplined for confirmation which they could not arrive at till they were found upon examination to have made a sufficient progress in the knowledge of christianity  xiii we must further observe that there was not only in those times this religious conversation among private christians but a constant correspondence between the churches that were established by the apostles or their successors in the several parts of the world if any new doctrine was started or any fact reported of our savior a strict enquiry was made among the churches especially those planted by the apostles themselves whether they had received any such doctrine or account of our savior from the mouths of the apostles or the tradition of those christians who had preceded the present members of the churches which were thus consulted by this means when any novelty was published it was immediately detected and censured  xiv st john who lived so many years after our savior was appealed to in these emergencies as the living oracle of the church and as his oral testimony lasted the first century many have observed that by a particular providence of god several of our saviors disciples and of the early converts of his religion lived to a very great age that they might personally convey the truth of the gospel to those times which were very remote from the first publication of it of these besides st john we have a remarkable instance in simeon who was one of the seventy sent forth by our savior to publish the gospel before his crucifixion and a near kinsman of the lord this venerable person who had probably heard with his own ears our saviors prophecy of the destruction of jerusalem presided over the church established in that city during the time of its memorable siege and drew his congregation out of those dreadful and unparalled calamities which befell his countrymen by following the advice our savior had given when they should see jerusalem encompassed with armies and the roman standards or abomination of desolation set up he lived till the year of our lord  0  when he was martyred under the emperor trajan  section vi i the tradition of the apostles secured by other excellent institutions  ii but chiefly by the writings of the evangelists  iii the diligence of the disciples and first christian converts to send abroad these writings  iv that the written account of our savior was the same with that delivered by tradition  v proved from the reception of the gospel by those churches which were established before it was written  vi from the uniformity of what was believed in the several churches  vii from a remarkable passage in irenaeus  viii records which are now lost of use to the three first centuries for confirming the history of our savior  ix instances of such records  i thus far we see how the learned pagans might apprize themselves from oral information of the particulars of our saviors history they could hear in every church planted in every distant part of the earth the account which was there received and preserved among them of the history of our savior they could learn the names and characters of those first missionaries that brought to them these accounts and the miracles by which god almighty attested their reports but the apostles and disciples of christ to preserve the history of his life and to secure their accounts of him from error and oblivion did not only set aside certain persons for that purpose as has been already shown but appropriated certain days to the commemoration of those facts which they had related concerning him the first day of the week was in all its returns a perpetual memorial of his resurrection as the devotional exercises adapted to friday and saturday were to denote to all ages that he was crucified on the one of those days and that he rested in the grave on the other you may apply the same remark to several of the annual festivals instituted by the apostles themselves or at furthest by their immediate successors in memory of the most important particulars in our saviors history to which we must add the sacraments instituted by our lord himself and many of those rites and ceremonies which obtained in the most early times of the church these are to be regarded as standing marks of such facts as were delivered by those who were eyewitnesses to them and which were contrived with great wisdom to last till time should be no more these without any other means might have in some measure conveyed to posterity the memory of several transactions in the history of our savior as they were related by his disciples at least the reason of these institutions though they might be forgotten and obscured by a long course of years could not but be very well known by those who lived in the three first centuries and a means of informing the inquisitive pagans in the truth of our saviors history that being the view in which i am to consider them  ii but least such a tradition though guarded by so many expedients should wear out by the length of time the four evangelists within about fifty or as theodoret affirms thirty years after our saviors death while the memory of his actions was fresh among them consigned to writing that history which for some years had been published only by the mouth of the apostles and disciples the further consideration of these holy penmen will fall under another part of this discourse  iii it will be sufficient to observe here that in the age which succeeded the apostles many of their immediate disciples sent or carrried in person the books of the four evangelists which had been written by apostles or at least approved by them to most of the churches which they had planted in the different parts of the world this was done with so much diligence that when pantaenus a man of great learning and piety had traveled into india for the propagation of christianity about the year of our lord  00 he found among that remote people the gospel of st matthew which upon his return from that country he brought with him to alexandria this gospel is generally supposed to have been left in those parts by st bartholomew the apostle of the indies who probably carried it with him before the writings of the three other evangelists were published  iv that the history of our savior as recorded by the evangelists was the same with that which had been before delivered by the apostles and disciples will further appear in the prosecution of this discourse and may be gathered from the following considerations  v had these writings differed from the sermons of the first planters of christianity either in history or doctrine there is no question but they would have been rejected by those churches which they had already formed but so consistent and uniform was the relation of the apostles that these histories appeared to be nothing else but their tradition and oral attestations made fixed and permanent thus was the fame of our savior which in so few years had gone through the whole earth confirmed and perpetuated by such records as would preserve the traditionary account of him to afterages and rectify it if at at any time by passing through several generations it might drop any part that was material or contract any thing that was false or fictitious  vi accordingly we find the same jesus christ who was born of a virgin who had wrought many miracles in palestine who was crucified rose again and ascended into heaven i say the same jesus christ had been preached and was worshipped in germany france spain and great britain in parthia media mesopotamia armenia phrygia asia and pamphylia in italy egypt afric and beyond cyrene india and persia and in short in all the islands and provinces that are visited by the rising or setting sun the same account of our saviors life and doctrine was delivered by thousands of preachers and believed in thousands of places who all as fast as it could be conveyed to them received the same account in writing from the four evangelists  vii irenaeus to this purpose very aptly remarks that those barbarous nations who in his time were not possessed of the written gospels and had only learned the history of our savior from those who had converted them to christianity before the gospels were written had among them the same accounts of our savior which are to be met with in the four evangelists an uncontestible proof of the harmony and concurrence between the holy scripture and the tradition of the churches in those early times of christianity  viii thus we see what opportunities the learned and inquisitive heathens had of informing themselves of the truth of our saviors history during the three first centuries especially as they lay nearer one than another to the fountainhead beside which there were many uncontroverted traditions records of christianity and particular histories that then threw light into these matters but are now entirely lost by which at that time any appearance of contradiction or seeming difficulties in the history of the evangelists were fully cleared up and explained though we meet with fewer appearances of this nature in the history of our savior as related by the four evangelists than in the accounts of any other person published by such a number of different historians who lived at so great a distance from the present age  ix among those records which are lost and were of great use to the primitive christians is the letter to tiberius which i have already mentioned that of marcus aurelius which i shall take notice of hereafter the writings of hegesippus who had drawn down the history of christianity to his own time which was not beyond the middle of the second century the genuine sibylline oracles which in the first ages of the church were easily distinguished from the spurious the records preserved in particular churches with many other of the same nature  section vii i the sight of miracles in those ages a further confirmation of pagan philosophers in the christian faith  ii the credibility of such miracles  iii a particular instance  iv martyrdom why considered as a standing miracle  v primitive christians thought many of the martyrs were supported by a miraculous power  vi proved from the nature of their sufferings  vii how martyrs further induced the pagans to embrace christianity  i there were other means which i find had a great influence on the learned of the three first centuries to create and confirm in them the belief of our blessed saviors history which ought not to be passed over in silence the first was the opportunity they enjoyed of examining those miracles which were on several occasions performed by christians and appeared in the church more or less during these first ages of christianity these had great weight with the men i am now speaking of who from learned pagans became fathers of the church for they frequently boast of them in their writings as attestations given by god himself to the truth of their religion  ii at the same time that these learned men declare how disigenuous base and wicked it would be how much beneath the dignity of philosophy and contrary to the precepts of christianity to utter falsehoods or forgeries in the support of a cause though never so just in it self they confidently assert this miraculous power which then subsisted in the church nay tell us that they themselves had been eyewitnesses of it at several times and in several instances nay appeal to the heathens themselves for the truth of several facts they relate nay challenge them to be present at their assemblies and satisfy themselves if they doubt of it nay we find that pagan authors have in some instances confessed this miraculous power  iii the letter of marcus aurelius whose army was preserved by a refreshing shower at the same time that his enemies were discomfited by a storm of lightning and which the heathen historians themselves allow to have been supernatural and the effect of magic i say this letter which ascribed this unexpected assistance to the prayers of the christians who then served in the army would have been thought an unquestionable testimony of the miraculous power i am speaking of had it been still preserved it is sufficient for me in this place to take notice that this was one of those miracles which had its influence on the learned converts because it is related by tertullian and the very letter appealed to when these learned men saw sickness and frenzy cured the dead raised the oracles put to silence the demons and evil spirits forced to confess themselves no gods by persons who only made use of prayer and adjurations in the name of their crucified savior how could they doubt of their saviors power on the like occasions as represented to them by the traditions of the church and the writings of the evangelists  iv under this head i cannot omit that which appears to me a standing miracle in the three first centuries i mean that amazing and supernatural courage or patience which was shown by innumerable multitudes of martyrs in those slow and painful torments that were inflicted on them i cannot conceive a man placed in the burning iron chair at lions amid the insults and mockeries of a crowded amphitheatre and still keeping his seat or stretched upon a grate of iron over coals of fire and breathing out his soul among the exquisite sufferings of such a tedious execution rather than renounce his religion or blaspheme his savior such trials seem to me above the strength of human nature and able to overbear duty reason faith conviction nay and the most absolute certainty of a future state humanity unassisted in an extraordinary manner must have shaken off the present pressure and have delivered it self out of such a dreadful distress by any means that could have been suggested to it we can easily imagine that many persons in so good a cause might have laid down their lives at the gibbet the stake or the block but to expire leisurely among the most exquisite tortures when they might come out of them even by a mental reservation or an hypocrisy which was not without a possibility of being followed by repentance and forgiveness has something in it so far beyond the force and natural strength of mortals that one cannot but think there was some miraculous power to support the sufferer  v we find the church of smyrna in that admirable letter which gives an account of the death of polycarp their beloved bishop mentioning the cruel torments of other early martyrs for christianity are of opinion that our savior stood by them in a vision and personally conversed with them to give them strength and comfort during the bitterness of their longcontinued agonies and we have the story of a young man who having suffered many tortures escaped with life and told his fellow christians that the pain of them had been rendered tolerable by the presence of an angel who stood by him and wiped off the tears and sweat which ran down his face whilst he lay under his sufferings we are assured at least that the first martyr for christianity was encouraged in his last moments by a vision of that divine person for whom he suffered and into whose presence he was then hastening  vi let any man calmly lay his hand upon his heart and after reading these terrible conflicts in which the ancient martyrs and confessors were engaged when they passed through such new inventions and varieties of pain as tired their tormentors and ask himself however zealous and sincere he is in his religion whether under such acute and lingering tortures he could still have held fast his integrity and have professed his faith to the last without a supernatural assistance of some kind or other for my part when i consider that it was not an unaccountable obstinacy in a single man or in any particular set of men in some extraordinary juncture but that there were multitudes of each sex of every age of different countries and conditions who for near  00 years together made this glorious confession of their faith in the midst of tortures and in the hour of death i must conclude that they were either of another make than men are at present or that they had such miraculous supports as were peculiar to those times of christianity when without them perhaps the very name of it might have been extinguished  vii it is certain that the deaths and sufferings of the primitive christians had a great share in the conversion of those learned pagans who lived in the ages of persecution which with some intervals and abatements lasted near  00 years after our savior justin martyr tertullian lactantius arnobius and others tell us that this first of all alarmed their curiosity roused their attention and made them seriously inquisitive into the nature of that religion which could endue the mind with so much strength and overcome the fear of death nay raise an earnest desire of it though it appeared in all its terrors this they found had not been effected by all the doctrines of those philosophers whom they had thoroughly studied and who had been laboring at this great point the sight of these dying and tormented martyrs engaged them to search into the history and doctrines of him for whom they suffered the more they searched the more they were convinced till their conviction grew so strong that they themselves embraced the same truths and either actually laid down their lives or were always in a readiness to do it rather than depart from them  section viii i the completion of our saviors prophecies confirmed pagans in their belief of the gospel  ii origens observation on that of his disciples being brought before kings and governors  iii on their being persecuted for their religion  iv on their preaching the gospel to all nations  v on the destruction of jerusalem and ruin of the jewish economy  vi these arguments strengthened by what has happened since origens time  i the second of those extraordinary means of great use to the learned and inquisitive pagans of the three first centuries for evincing the truth of the history of our savior was the completion of such prophecies as are recorded of him in the evangelists they could not indeed form any arguments from what he foretold and was fulfilled during his life because both the prophecy and the completion were over before they were published by the evangelists though as origin observes what end could there be in forging some of these predictions as that of st peters denying his master and all his disciples forsaking him in the greatest extremity which reflects so much shame on the great apostle and on all his companions nothing but a strict adherence to truth and to matters of fact could have prompted the evangelists to relate a circumstance so disadvantageous to their own reputation as that father has well observed  ii but to pursue his reflections on this subject there are predictions of our savior recorded by the evangelists which were not completed till after their deaths and had no likelihood of being so when they were pronounced by our blessed savior such was that wonderful notice he gave them that they should be brought before governors and kings for his sake for a testimony against them and the gentiles mat  0   with the other like prophecies by which he foretold that his disciples were to be persecuted is there any other doctrine in the world says this father whose followers are punished can the enemies of christ say that he knew his opinions were false and impious and that therefore he might well conjecture and foretell what would be the treatment of those persons who should embrace them supposing his doctrines were really such why should this be the consequence what likelihood that men should be brought before kings and governors for opinions and tenets of any kind when this never happened even to the epicureans who absolutely denied a providence nor to the peripateticks themselves who laughed at the prayers and sacrifices which were made to the divinity are there any but the christians who according to this prediction of our savior being brought before kings and governors for his sake are pressed to their latest gasp of breath by their respective judges to renounce christianity and to procure their liberty and rest by offering the same sacrifices and taking the same oaths that others did  iii consider the time when our savior pronounced those words matt  0   whosoever shall confess me before men him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven had you heard him speak after this manner when as yet his disciples were under no such trials you would certainly have said within your self if these speeches of jesus are true and if according to his prediction governors and kings undertake to ruin and destroy those who shall profess themselves his disciples we will believe not only that he is a prophet but that he has received power from god sufficient to preserve and propagate his religion and that he would never talk in such a peremptory and discouraging manner were he not assured that he was able to subdue the most powerful opposition that could be made against the faith and doctrine which he taught  iv who is not struck with admiration when he represents to himself our savior at that time foretelling that his gospel should be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations or as st origin who rather quotes the sense than the words to serve for a conviction to kings and people when at the same time he finds that his gospel has accordingly been preached to greeks and barbarians to the learned and to the ignorant and that there is no quality or condition of life able to exempt men from submitting to the doctrine of christ as for us says this great author in another part of his book against celsus when we see every day those events exactly accomplished which our savior foretold at so great a distance that his gospel is preached in all the world matthew      that his disciples go and teach all nations matthew      and that those who have received his doctrine are brought for his sake before governors and before kings matthew  0   we are filled with admiration and our faith in him is confirmed more and more what clearer and stronger proofs can celsus ask for the truth of what he spoke  v origin insists likewise with great strength on that wonderful prediction of our savior concerning the destruction of jerusalem pronounced at a time as he observes when there was no likelihood nor appearance of it this has been taken notice of and inculcated by so many others that i shall refer you to what this father has said on the subject in the first book against celsus and as to the accomplishment of this remarkable prophecy shall only observe that whoever reads the account given us by josephus without knowing his character and compares it with what our savior foretold would think the historian had been a christian and that he had nothing else in view but to adjust the event to the prediction  vi i cannot quit this head without taking notice that origin would still have triumphed more in the foregoing arguments had he lived an age longer to have seen the roman emperors and all their governors and provinces submitting themselves to the christian religion and glorying in its profession as so many kings and sovereigns still place their relation to christ at the head of their titles  how much greater confirmation of his faith would he have received had he seen our saviors prophecy stand good in the destruction of the temple and the dissolution of the jewish economy when jews and pagans united all their endeavors under julian the apostate to baffle and falsify the prediction the great preparations that were made for rebuilding the temple with the hurricane earthquake and eruptions of fire that destroyed the work and terrified those employed in the attempt from proceeding in it are related by many historians of the same age and the substance of the story testified both by pagan and jewish writers as ammianus marcellinus and zemathdavid the learned chrysostom in a sermon against the jews tells them this fact was then fresh in the memories even of their young men that it happened but twenty years ago and that it was attested by all the inhabitants of jerusalem where they might still see the marks of it in the rubbish of that work from which the jews desisted in so great a fright and which even julian had not the courage to carry on this fact which is in it self so miraculous and so indisputable brought over many of the jews to christianity and shows us that after our saviors prophecy against it the temple could not be preserved from the plough passing over it by all the care of titus who would fain have prevented its destruction and that instead of being reedified by julian all his endeavors toward it did but still more literally accomplish our saviors prediction that not one stone should be left upon another  the ancient christians were so entirely persuaded of the force of our saviors prophecies and of the punishment which the jews had drawn upon themselves and upon their children for the treatment which the messiah had received at their hands that they did not doubt but they would always remain an abandoned and dispersed people an hissing and an astonishment among the nations as they are to this day in short that they had lost their peculiarity of being gods people which was now transferred to the body of christians and which preserved the church of christ among all the conflicts difficulties and persecutions in which it was engaged as it had preserved the jewish government and economy for so many ages whilst it had the same truth and vital principle in it notwithstanding it was so frequently in danger of being utterly abolished and destroyed origin in his fourth book against celsus mentioning their being cast out of jerusalem the place to which their worship was annexed deprived of their temple and sacrifice their religious rites and solemnities and scattered over the face of the earth ventures to assure them with a face of confidence that they would never be reestablished since they had committed that horrid crime against the savior of the world this was a bold assertion in the good man who knew how this people had been so wonderfully reestablished in former times when they were almost swallowed up and in the most desperate state of desolation as in their deliverance out of the babylonish captivity and the oppressions of antiochus epiphanes nay he knew that within less than a hundred years before his own time the jews had made such a powerful effort for their reestablishment under barchocab in the reign of adrian as shook the whole roman empire but he founded his opinion on a sure word of prophecy and on the punishment they had so justly incurred and we find by a long experience of   00 years that he was not mistaken nay that his opinion gathers strength daily since the jews are now at a greater distance from any probability of such a reestablishment than they were when origin wrote  section ix i the lives of primitive christians another means of bringing learned pagans into their religion  ii the change and reformation of their manners  iii this looked upon as supernatural by the learned pagans  iv and strengthened the accounts given of our saviors life and history  v the jewish prophecies of our savior an argument for the heathens belief  vi pursued  vii pursued  i there was one other means enjoyed by the learned pagans of the three first centuries for satisfying them in the truth of our saviors history which i might have flung under one of the foregoing heads but as it is so shining a particular and does so much honor to our religion i shall make a distinct article of it and only consider it with regard to the subject i am upon i mean the lives and manners of those holy men who believed in christ during the first ages of christianity i should be thought to advance a paradox should i affirm that there were more christians in the world during those times of persecution than there are at present in these which we call the flourishing times of christianity but this will be found an indisputable truth if we form our calculation upon the opinions which prevailed in those days that every one who lives in the habitual practice of any voluntary sin actually cuts himself off from the benefits and profession of christianity and whatever he may call himself is in reality no christian nor ought to be esteemed as such  ii in the times we are now surveying the christian religion showed its full force and efficacy on the minds of men and by many examples demonstrated what great and generous souls it was capable of producing it exalted and refined its proselytes to a very high degree of perfection and set them far above the pleasures and even the pains of this life it strengthened the infirmity and broke the fierceness of human nature it lifted up the minds of the ignorant to the knowledge and worship of him that made them and inspired the vicious with a rational devotion a strict purity of heart and an unbounded love to their fellow creatures in proportion as it spread through the world it seemed to change mankind into another species of beings no sooner was a convert initiated into it but by an easy figure he became a new man and both acted and looked upon himself as one regenerated and born a second time into another state of existence  iii it is not my business to be more particular in the accounts of primitive christianity which have been exhibited so well by others but rather to observe that the pagan converts of whom i am now speaking mention this great reformation of those who had been the greatest sinners with that sudden and surprising change which it made in the lives of the most profligate as having something in it supernatural miraculous and more than human origin represents this power in the christian religion as no less wonderful than that of curing the lame and blind or cleansing the leper many others represent it in the same light and looked upon it as an argument that there was a certain divinity in that religion which showed it self in such strange and glorious effects  iv this therefore was a great means not only of recommending christianity to honest and learned heathens but of confirming them in the belief of our saviors history when they saw multitudes of virtuous men daily forming themselves upon his example animated by his precepts and actuated by that spirit which he had promised to send among his disciples  v but i find no argument made a stronger impression on the minds of these eminent pagan converts for strengthening their faith in the history of our savior than the predictions relating to him in those old prophetic writings which were deposited among the hands of the greatest enemies to christianity and owned by them to have been extant many ages before his appearance the learned heathen converts were astonished to see the whole history of their saviors life published before he was born and to find that the evangelists and prophets in their accounts of the messiah differed only in point of time the one foretelling what should happen to him and the other describing those very particulars as what had actually happened this our savior himself was pleased to make use of as the strongest argument of his being the promised messiah and without it would hardly have reconciled his disciples to the ignominy of his death as in that remarkable passage which mentions his conversation with the two disciples on the day of his resurrection st luke chap    verse    to the end  vi the heathen converts after having traveled through all human learning and fortified their minds with the knowledge of arts and sciences were particularly qualified to examine these prophecies with great care and impartiality and without prejudice or prepossession if the jews on the one side put an unnatural interpretation on these prophecies to evade the force of them in their controversies with the christians or if the christians on the other side overstrained several passages in their applications of them as it often happens

the point so far as to think whatever excellent doctrine they had met with among pagan writers had been stole from their conversation with the jews or from the perusal of these writings which they had
