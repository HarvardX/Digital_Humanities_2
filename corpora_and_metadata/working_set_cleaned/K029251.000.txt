without being gratified for his time and trouble  the preface which for the better understanding of the book the reader is desired to peruse first this little book purely for want of leisure to look over and correct it in order for a second edition has been out of priot a considerable while neither should i have spared time now from my other affairs and private practice which indeed is sufficient to ingross all my thoughts had it not been very often called for since the first impression has been sold off and my self mush importuned to reprint it on account of the service the medicines prescibd in it have done daily do and are further likely to do those afflicted with the illnesses it treats of  in this second edition i have added altered and amended whatever the many observations i have made and my longer experience caused me to think necessary and have given every where very particular and more minute directions how the patients should manage themselves under the course of remedies i have advised to than was in the first edition so that as the censoriousness of the age we live in and no other reason made me determine when i first published this book not to set my name to it or be known as the author there will now be the less occasion for it  i designed to have added some very remarkable cases of persons that i have very lately cured of the several distempers the book treats of and that by the very medicines i have herein prescribed but considering that those additions would inhance the price of the book and that the cases inserted in the first edition are sufficient to illustrate the method recommended i resolved to let it remain in that respect just as it was before  when i first commenced physician i considered how and after what manner i could render my self serviceable to the public in my station and observing that few of our faculty had bent their study to gain a true knowledge of the cause and cure of female grievances under which abundance of women lived miserably laboring with afflicting weaknesses continually languishing and consuming by deplorable illnesses peculiar to that sex and at last forced to submit to death purely for want of proper advice and medicines for their distempers which i then thought as i soon after found might be easily cured by an ingenious physician if he rightly understood the true cause of them seriously weighing this i resolved to study the cure of the weaknesses and maladies incident only to women many of the gentlemen of our profession though most learned aind ingenious in other cases not rightly understanding female distempers because not inclined to study or practice that way whereby thousands of women i believe have lamentably suffered many years together and numbers gone to the grave many years sooner than they would have done had they been treated in a proper method and with the most efficacious medicines  i know it is a common thing for some gentlemen of our art to excuse their not practicing in those illnesses by alleging that women have their midwives to apply to in such cases but if they maturely considered the danger women are in from even the least degree of the weaknesses i have in this book treated of i am sure they would be of another opinion for indeed how can it be supposed that midwives though ingenious in their proper business should cure distempers of which they know not the cause but are truly ignorant of the whole matter being unacquainted with the medical art not in the least understanding the virtue of medicines or the reason of their different operations upon the blood and other fluids of the body so that if a woman is cured of weakness or illness by them it may be justly esteemed a mere chance and she has reason to thank god that instead of cure she did not meet with ruin having trusted her life to the unskilful which women would never do if they were sensible of the nature and danger of even their slightest indispositions if not managed rightly  thus when i first began to practice physic being convinced by these melancholy reflections that i could be very useful in my generation by studying and obtaining the perfect knowledge of the indispositions incident only to the female sex i resolved to endeavor to find out the real cause thereof and if possible a better and more certain method of cure than commonly practiced which with diligent study much application and careful observation i quickly obtained in such a measure that i thank god i have had very great success and have perfectly cured abundance of the female sex who had suffered many years under deplorable sickness and have also retrieved several from the edge of the grave who had been given over by all insomuch that many who through illness afflicting them have been reduced to mere skeletons and so weak as scarcely able to stand i have through the blessing of god restored to their perfect health and strength so as to become more brisk and well than ever and to conceive and bear children and that by the method and medicines inferred in this book which after many changes and experiments i have pitched upon and by unquessionable experience have found them absolutely effectual and do now wholly rely upon them in my private practice  but becoming still more and more sensible of the misery most women undergo at one time or other through illness afflicting them and considering that a great many of the female sex are unwilling to make known their private indispositions to men though that modesty often proves the loss of their lives and that those who do many times stay till too late to be cured or perhaps fall into the hands of practitioners that do not rightly understand their distempers or else apply to midwives for help commonly to their ruin i say thinking on the dismal misfortunes and calamitous circumstances that thus attend injure and often destroy many women in the prime of their age it put me upon undertaking something whereby i might be more generally useful to the world and in a greater degree serviceable to suffering women than i could be in private practice only therefore i chose to write this little book wherein i have practically treated in a familiar way and so as the meanest reader may understand of the symptoms nature cause and cure of the secret illnesses that women are subject to and have prescribed as before mentioned such medicines as will most certainty cure them without trouble whereby women who are not willing to make known their weaknesses and diseases may be acquainted with their distempers and know how to cure themselves safely and for a trifling charge by which means those who before were thought incapable of conceiving may be rendered fruitful and others be retrieved from the danger of death which most of the illnesses i have mentioned will certainly bring upon the patients if not timely cured  the medicines i have advised to are pleasant to take safe and easy in operation and being founded upon unerring experience are certainly to be depended upon as absolutely effectual for the weaknesses and illnesses they are mentioned to cure  and considering the trouble and difficulty most women would find to get the medicines made up and the hazard they would run in trusting to apothecaries boys that understand not the artful method of compounding medicines therefore that nothing might be wanting wherein i could render my self serviceable i have left a quantity of all the medicines mentioned in this book prepared with my own hand with the gentlewoman at the two blue posts near the square in haydonyard in the minories london where this book is also sold and intend always so to do for the benefit of the female sex while god grants me life and i here assure the world that i will never suffer the medicines to be sold elsewhere without first giving notice in another edition of this book so that all persons who have occasion for any of the medicines herein prescribed will by buying them there always be sure to have them right and well prepared upon which they may entirely rely for the cure of the illnesses they are appropriated to  and the better to prevent all abuses i have designedly concealed the chief chemical preparation in every prescription on which secret the virtue of each medicine mostly depends and without which would be almost insignificant but being regularly compounded or mixed according to art does so alter ferment and adapt all the ingredients in each prescribed remedy to the cure of the illness for which it is intended that were it discovered it would appear wonderful to all artists in physic  the reason of my thus concealing the most powerful ingredient of each medicine was that because women cannot make up the medicines themselves they must had i freely declared the whole have had them made up by an apothecary who very likely by reason of the dearness of the main ingredient in each would exact an extravagant price or else not make the medicines up right but put in one thing instead of another which many apothecaries too often do in making up chargeable prescriptions to the detriment of the patient and disadvantage of the physician  therefore to prevent any from being so grossly imposed upon and to remedy all inconveniences was it that i did not make known the chief ingredient in each prescription but appointed the medicines rightly prepared with great care and exactness to be sold at the place before mentioned and for the fixed easy prices set down in the catalogue of them at the end of the book which prices are as reasonable as the medicines can well be allowed for and much cheaper than they would be if rightly made up in small quanties by any other person were the specific preparation in each remedy known i having in this second edition carefully calculated the intrinsic value of them and for the sake of those whose circumstances may not be extraordinary lowered the price where there was room for it so that most of the medicines are now set down at a cheaper rate than they were in the first edition  now by this means all gentlewomen and others will be freed from trouble and besure of having the true preparation which will always prove effectual and that at an easy rate by only sending a servant or other person to the place aforesaid to ask for such or such a medicine by its name or number and by giving so much for it as in the catalogue is set down to be the price  those who live in the country may also order any friend in london or a carrier that comes to town to buy at the same place any of the medicines they have occasion for and so be supplied with them with ease  thus the main intent of writing this treatise was for the service and benefit of the female sex and therefore without studying artfully to embellish it with powerful rhetoric or a beautiful style i chose to let it appear in a plain dress so as to be perfectly understood by the meanest capacity which perhaps may give distaste to some of our learned critics who i did not design to please and whose censure i do not value being well assured that all men of ingenuity and candor who practice physic in whose hands it may chance to fall will applaud the undertaking for they will plainly perceive that an intent of being serviceable to my generation was the chief motive of it and will also find notwithstanding i have concealed the main ingredient in every prescription that the book will be of use to young practitioners in physic i having in a more concise manner discovered the signs nature causes and best and nearest method of cure of female grievances than perhaps they may elsewhere meet with and in the seventh chapter treating of barrenness have given such a clear and particular account of conception and generation as may serve to rectify the notions of several who have imbibed very absurd opinions concerning them  one thing i must inform my readers of which is that while i was writing this book i was often concerned that necessity obliged me to mention womens weaknesses so plainly as i found my self forced to do to be well understood by the female sex could i have made it intelligible otherwise i should have been heartily glad but that being impossible i have treated of all their indispositions with as much caution and modesty as i could and therefore hope none will make an ill use of it or in the least blame me on that account  i shall no longer detain my readers but hoping it will meet with a reception suitable to my good intention of writing it for the benefit of suffering women and leaving them to judge of it themselves subscribe my self their  faithful friend and humble servant august  0th      the contents chap i of the deficiency of the terms and green sickness in virgins page   chap ii of the immoderate flux or overflowing of the terms p    chap iii of the exceeding pain and uneasiness some women endure just upon the coming down of their courses and of the bad color and ill smell of the blood that flows from some persons as also of the disorders women in years are subject to when their courses begin to leave them page    chap iv of the piles page    chap v of the whites page    chap vi of the downfalling of the womb and fundament page    chap vii of barrenness with a clear and very particular account of conception and generation page    chap viii of miscarriage with directions how to cause speedy delivery in childbirth and also how to rectify the disorders of the lochia or childbed purgations p    a rational account of the natural weaknesses of women etc the introduction in treating of the natural weaknesses and distempers peculiarly incident to the female sex i shall begin with those occasioned by the irregularity of the menstrual flux or courses which begin to flow in young women when they are about fourteen years old and in some sooner about that age virgins begin to grow ripe and if in health to think of love the blood also at certain periods undergoes a new ferment and while that continues issues out through the blood vessels that open into the womb and this natural purgation or flux of blood is called the monthly terms or courses  when they first come down in maids they many times do not flow above once in two months or ten weeks but as the person grows more ripe and the blood and its natural ferment increases they come down oftener till the settled term of once a month is fixed and then they continue so constantly till forty forty five and sometimes till fifty years of age or longer except when illness being with child or suckling children hinders  they flow generally from first to last four five or six days and sometimes though very rarely seven and the quantity of blood that comes away during that time if the flux is regular and the person in perfect health is commonly as much as may be contained in the shell of a goose egg but in some women especially those of a strong body and sanguine complexion they flow in a larger quantity than in others if the terms flow constantly once a month and in a due quantity they generally preserve women in perfect health but if they do not or if there is any disorder in this flux women cannot be well cause the course of nature is then changed and her admirable order broke  the disorders this monthly purgation is liable to being several and very different i intend to treat of them and of the other indispositions women are particularly subject to in their order and under their respespective heads or chapters  chap i of the deficiency of the terms and green sickness in virgins the deficiency or suppression of the courses is when they flow too seldom or but little in quantity that is too sparingly as by drops etc or not at all the fault is either in the blood which is then too gross or thick occasioned by a bad stomach ill digestion of food colds grief etc or in the vessels of the womb through which the terms flow which then are obstructed by a viscous or tough humor  if the badness of the blood is the cause of the deficiency of the courses the person becomes pale and dull unwilling to stir about and is afflicted with loss of appetite loathing of food desire after things not fit to be eaten bad digestion pain in the stomach which in some patients is so violent by fits as hardly to be borne shortness of breath often swelling about the ankles sometimes vomiting and universal disorder also if any blood does flow it generally appears of a pale and wan color  if the fault be in the vessels of the womb the person then retains her usual color but at the time the courses ought to flow feels racking pains in the small of her back and about her loins weariness of her limbs and moving pains accompanied with a violent motion of the blood flushing in the face vapors headache and general uneasiness over the whole body and sometimes the blood issues out at the nose hemorrhoidveins etc  when the courses do not flow at all in maids and the obstruction is of long standing it is then called the green sickness but widows and sometimes married women are afflicted with this distemper the latter must take great care they do not mistake the stoppage of the monthly courses occasioned by their conceiving for this disease least by taking medicines to cure their fancied illness they should cause a miscarriage but if they have not their courses for three or four months together and become pale and wan with difficulty of breathing etc without growing bigger or having any signs of being with child they may then be assured that the deficiency or suppression of the terms is a distemper and not caused by impregnation or conception  if the deficiency or stoppage of the courses is not speedily remedied barrenness and very dangerous illnesses will be produced as cachexy asthma inflammation and ulceration of the lungs pleurisy hysteric fits dropsy etc  now to take off all or any of the above enumerated symptoms to prevent the dismal effects of this indisposition and to cure the deficiency or suppression of the courses whether in maids married women or widows such medicines must be given as will cleanse the stomach and first passages dissolve all viscous humors purify the blood and juices restore their natural ferment and effectually open all manner of obstructions in any part of the body after which such corroborating deobstructive remedies must be prescribed as will confirm the texture of the fluids strengthen the stomach and bowels create an appetite cause a good digestion and finally establish the blood in its natural florid state and thereby assuredly restore a good color to the face and perfect health to the body  in the first place therefore three or four days before the terms are expected or ought to flow the patient must take four of the following purging pills betimes in the morning fasting but if it be the first time of their stoppage and happens as sometimes it will after the courses have begun to appear then the purging pills must be taken the very next morning drinking water gruel posset drink barlywater warm ale or tea in the working and they will give four five or fix easy stools handsomely cleanse the stomach and bowels and do infinite good sometimes a dose alone will bring down the courses especially if the illness be but of short standing and occasioned only by obstruction of the wombvessels they are thus made no   the purging pills take of the best russia castor four grains opening saffron of steel two scruples pil cochia the greater two drams chemical oil of savin three drops of my mineral secret half a dram balsam of peru nine drops syrup of mugwort a sufficient quantity mix and make fifteen pills    a day or two after taking a dose of these purging pills if the courses do not come down the patient must begin the following pleasant opening powder taking full as much of it as will lie heaped upon a shilling betimes every morning and at three a clock every afternoon and also about eight a clock every evening for a complete month together either licking it up from a spoon by it self or mixing it with near half a spoonful of white wine or with a little of any pleasant syrup as she likes best and drinking a large glass of white wine or a draught of strong mace ale or which is better than either a large glass of bitter wine after each dose and walking about at least half an hour or more after it and it will open all manner of obstructions strengthen the stomach purify the blood rectify the juices take away all paleness dullness weariness difficulty of breathing pain in the stomach etc create an appetite cause a good digestion bring a good color into the face and make the patient brisk lively active and healthy to admiration it is made thus no   the opening powder take winters cinnamon cloves nutmegs of each one scruple compound powder of roots of cuckowpints one dram prepared steel half an ounce double resind loafsugar one ounce of my aperitive magistery half a dram mix and make a subtle powder according to art which keep in a warm dry place for use    but if the deficiency or suppression of the courses is of long standing or should prove stubborn and not to be removed after taking this powder for a whole month or thirty days together which will very seldom happen then it will be necessary to take another dose of the purging pills and a day or two after that the powder again in like order as before and so to continue it till the illness is effectually cured which will soon be observing all the while she is under this course to abstain from all fruit greens and herbs and also not to drink too freely of small liquors such as tea small beer etc but only what is just sufficient to quench drowth for small liquors being drank quickly after taking the powder or in too large a quantity at any time will not only prevent its having so good effect as otherwise it would but also cause a little sickishness at stomach  but if it any time the powder should happen to lie heavy on the stomach or make the patient a little sickish she may presently be relieved from that or any other inconvenience by drinking a large glass or two of good strong white wine  if the patient finds four of the purging pills work a little too much the first time she takes them then the next time she must take but three of them for a dose but if she finds four of them not purge enough then she must take five pills for the next dose  but if the patient by being long afflicted with this illness or by taking other medicines is brought into a very weak condition so as to be unfit to bear purging then she must not take the purging pills but begin with the opening powder and continue to take it constantly as directed before without taking the purging pills at all and during the time she is taking the powder to provoke the terms she must use moderate exercise almost continually such as walking abroad or riding on horseback stirring about house up and down stairs etc  and after the patient by taking the purging pills or opening powder or both has had her courses then to strengthen the womb and its vessels to establish the good texture of the blood and juices and to confirm her health effectually so that she may not relapse into the former disorder it will be highly needful for her to take the quantity of a large nutmeg of the following corroborating electuary from off the point of a knife every morning and at four a clock every afternoon for a fortnight three weeks or a month together as she finds proper drinking a glass of white wine or rather bitter wine after each dose it is thus made no   the corroborating electuary take of volatile salt of hartshorn ten grains russia castor fifteen grains compound powder of cuckowpints half a dram treacle of andromachus candid nutmegs candid ginger of each two scruples and five grains candid orangepeel candid angelica steel prepared with sulphur of each a dram conserve of roman wormwood two drams of my specific salt ten grains syrup of coral a sufficient quantity to make an electuary according to art    this electuary visibly revives and strengthens the whole body increases the blood and spirits comforts drives away melancholy and makes those robust and strong who before were weak and pining so altering the whole frame of nature for the beter that one would stand amazed at it  thus having briefly made known all that is necessary for the cure of the deficiency or stoppage of the terms whether in maids married women or widows i shall conclude this chapter with a letter i received while i was writing it from a gentleman in hartford whose daughter a young gentlewoman about seventeen years of age had never had the benefit of nature but was almost ruined by the green sickness being exceeding pale short breathed and hardly able to move about without any appetite to food but desirous of eating chalk cinders wall etc which she could scarcely be kept from her affectionate parents had taken the advice of several physicians and the young lady took a great many medicines to no purpose till she took my purging pills and opening powder before mentioned which happily cured her she chanced accidentally to take my medicines thus  her father being in london about six weeks ago was with several other elderly men and their wives invited by a worthy gentleman his friend to dine with him i being also desired made one of the company and after dinner among other discourse the gentlewomen happening to talk of the respective sicknesses they had suffered and of the indispositions several of their friends labored under the hartfordshire gentleman took that opportunity understanding i was a physician to acquaint me with his daughters illness as soon as he had done i was sent for away but heard afterward that the company proceeding on that topic the gentleman of the house and his wife were pleased to speak much to my advantage in respect to the great success that attended my practice in female distempers the hartfordshire gentleman went into the country the next morning and coming to his house found his wife who is about thirty six years of age exceeding ill with torturing pains in her back and sometimes in her head attended with flushing in her face feverish heat and universal uneasiness which was all occasioned by a suppression of the courses through a violent cold she got when they were just ready to flow it being the first time she had been afflicted in that manner she was the more surprised at it and as her husband came in was going to send for a physician near them under whose hands her daughter had for some time been but her husband mentioning what he had heard of my skill and both of them considering what little help their daughter had received from the prescriptions of all the physicians they had consulted concerning her resolved to send to me accordingly the gentleman wrote his wifes case in a letter and sent his servant on horseback with it immediately desiring me to advise to what i thought proper and send something by his man as soon as could be i considered the ladys case and being sensible that her indisposition and all the symptoms would be removed by provoking her courses which were only hindered from coming down by an obstruction the violent cold had caused in the vessels of the womb through which the blood flows i therefore sent her a box of my purging pills one dose of which i expected would remedy the whole matter but least the stoppage of the terms should prove stubborn as sometimes it will i sent her a pretty large quantity of my opening powder also with directions to take four of the purging pills betimes the next morning and if they did not accomplish the business to begin the opening powder the day following just as i have directed before in this chapter till her courses came down after which i wrote that it would be necessary for her to take my corroborating electuary to confirm her health and prevent a relapse for the future i informed the gentleman also that if one dose of the purging pills removed her illness then if he pleased to let his daughter take the pills and powder in the same manner as i directed his wife to take them i was satisfied they would cure her also they followed my advice and the medicines had the desired effect not only upon the gentlemans wife whom one dose of the pills set to rights but also upon his daughter and another young woman at hartford who were both cured as by the letter which the gentleman sent me with a very handsome gratification appears more particularly  hartford december      0 worthy sir i send this to return you my hearty thanks for the great service you have done my family one dose of your purging pills brought my wife into good order without taking the opening powder at all i should have wrote to you before now but that my wife receiving so much benefit was resolved that my daughter who had been ill with the green sickness a great while and had taken abundance of physic in vain as i told you when i was in london should take both your pills and opening powder as you advised in your letter and therefore i delayed writing till i could give you an account of the effect they had upon her she being tired with taking medicines was with much difficulty persuaded to take one dose of the purging pills which worked very well and being a little weak the next day she did not begin the opening powder till the day following but then continued it constantly for about three weeks after which she took another dose of the purging pills and the next day the opening powder again which she took for about tour days more and it brought the benefit of nature upon her since which she eats drinks and digests her victuals well looks something fresh and ruddy and is recovered to admiration my wife gave the remainder of the powder to a neighbors daughter who was in the same condition but so weak as not fit to take the purging pills and that alone has cured her in about a fortnight all but want of strength which she now daily recovers and begins to look brisk and have a good stomach now sir my wife and daughter and the young woman desire you to send the corroborating electuary that in your letter you informed me would be necessary for my wife to take after the other medicines to confirm health and prevent relapse and they believe by the excellent effects they have already found by your pills and powder that that will be all the physic they shall have occasion for   the rest of the letter contained nothing but an encomium on my skill and ability with thanks etc for my civility therefore i purposely omit it  chap ii of the immoderate flux or overflowing of the terms the courses are properly deemed immoderate when the blood flows from the wombvessels in too large a quantity or too long together or oftener than once a month in some women they continue many days together in others not longer than usual but then return often as once a fortnight or sooner and in some the flux is more in others less violent many women also as soon as the courses stop are afflicted with the whites or piles and sometimes with both  this illness or excessive flowing of the terms is generally caused by an evil ferment occasioned by sharp scorbutic salts in the blood and juices and sometimes by disorder of the wombvessels  the overflowing of the courses is most commonly accompanied with a burning feverish heat tearing pains in the small of the back pain and heat about the neck of the womb violent headache loss of appetite and languishing weakness of the whole body and if not speedily cured reduces the person exceedingly causing total barrenness lasting weakness pining consumption etc which terminate in death if not timely remedied  if the blood that comes away is of a bright red color and when taken upon linen and dry discovers a pale circle it shows that the blood is thin and waterish the vessels of the womb too lax or loose the patient very weak but not exceeding feverish but if it be of a deep red and easily clots it is then a sign of a redundancy of blood and that the person is very hot feverish and uneasy and if the blood in coming away causes a great itching and uneasiness of the parts it shows that the juices of the body are very full of sharp acrid salts  now to cure this indisposition revulsion by bleeding etc being first made such medicines must be prescribed as by their cooling absorbent and subastringent qualities will put a stop to the violent ferment of the blood allay thirst and heat take off the fever subdue all scorbutic acrid salts in the blood rectify the juices and strengthen the wombvessels by which means the courses will be quickly stopped and the patient wholly restored to perfect health and strength  for which end and effectually to prevent the aforementioned ill consequences the patient must first be let blood in the arm to the quantity of about nine or ten ounces and the very next morning about six a clock she must take the quantity of a very large wallnut or more of the following laxative electuary either by it self or dissolved in a little thin water gruel which she likes best and sleeping about an hour after it and if in about two hours after it is taken it should not move her to stool then it will be proper for her to take as much more of it so as to give her five or six stools water gruel barleywater or tea are liquors proper to be drank after it begins to operate no   the laxative electuary take extract of cassia new drawn lenitive electuary and cream of tartar of each six drams of my loosening confect six drams mix and make an electuary according to art    and the day after she has been purged with the laxative electuary she must begin the following cooling anodyne powder taking as much of it as will lie heaped upon a shilling in a little warm water gruel or other agreeable liquor betimes every morning and at four a clock every afternoon till all feverish heat and other symptoms are entirely taken off no   the cooling anodyne powder take of prunel stone one dram white amber prepared a dram and a half cooling species of gum tragacanth two drams of my anodyne salt three drams and a half mix and make a fine powder which keep for use    and besides this powder the patient mus take the quantity of a large nutmeg of the following pleasant specific electuary from the point of a knife at eleven a clock ever forenoon and at eight a clock every nigh till the flux is quite stopped the cure perfectly completed and the strength wholly restored minding not to eat any thing for a hour before or after each dose but drinkin a little of any agreeable liquor to wash  down it is thus made no   the specific electuary take balaustines troches of lemnian earth of each one scruple red coral prepared pomegranate peel of each half a dram earth of japan aromatic powder with roses of each two scruples confect of jacinth a dram juice of chermes berries marmalade of quinces of each two drams conserve of red roses three drams chemical oil of nutmegs three drops of my metalline absorbent powder two scruples syrup of quinces a sufficient quantity to make an electuary    these two medicines being taken according to the directions will immediately strike at the very cause of the illness allay the violent heat and thirst take off the fever rectify the blood and juices stop the immoderate flux strengthen the back and weakened vessels of the womb prevent the piles which are often caused by the common medicines given to stop the courses and will bring the patient into good order in a short time and by continuing of them for about a fortnight will perfectly restore her to health and strength and effectually prevent a relapse for the future  when the fever and all preternatural heat is perfectly extinguished the patient may leave off taking the cooling anodyne powder and take only the pleasant specific electuary as before directed so also if the patient should happen to be troubled with the colic or gripes she must omit the powder but constantly take the electuary till she is perfectly cured because it admirably strengthens the stomach back and weakened vessels brings the blood and juices into excellent order fortifies the spirits and firmly establishes health and vigor  if the patient while she is taking the pleasant specific electuary finds her self costive or hard bound then once in three or four days she must take a dose of the laxative or loosening electuary in the morning fasting as before directed omitting to take the other medicines that day and it will give three or four gentle stools and make the body pleasant and easy without griping making sick weakening or causing the least trouble or confinement  note whilst the patient is in this course it will be convenient for her to drink freely of tea or water gruel which will cool and dilute the blood quench thirst and do much good she mus also mind to abstain from all strong  inflaming liquors and from hot spiced food or very salt meats  note also that if the patient is reduced very low and is so exceeding weak and faint as not able to bear bleeding or gentle purging though that very rarely happens then she must have immediate recourse to the opening powder and pleasant specific electuary taking them as before directed omitting either first bleeding or purging or both as she finds most proper  thus these directions being followed and the medicines regularly taken the overflowing of the courses though never so bad will most certainly be cured an eminent instance or two of which occurring to my memory i judge the relation will be acceptable as well as serviceable to the reader and therefore will insert the particulars and so end this chapter  the first case i design to mention is of a gentlewoman about thirty who for six or eight months before had been afflicted with the flowing of her courses constantly once a fortnight in the same quantity that used to flow when she was in good order once a month and as soon as they went off she was exceedingly troubled with the piles for three or four days and after that with the whites to an excessive degree which always held her till her terms came down again this indisposition had reduced her to exceeding weakness her stomach was much out of order she was continually feverish had great pain in her head but a more violent pain in her back insomuch that she was hardly able to walk about house as soon as i was acquainted with her illness i found that her blood by the pale circle it discovered upon linen was poor waterish and very acrid which occasioned the feverish heat and all the other symptoms  and considering that her stomach and bowels were very foul i therefore first ordered her to take a very large dose of my laxative electuary the next morning to cleanse them which had very good effect and the day following i caused her to begin my cooling anodyne powder and pleasant specific electuary and take them as before directed for two days which took off all immoderate heat and stopped her courses after that i directed her to continue the pleasant specific electuary alone for a fortnight in order to absorb all sharp humors rectify her blood and strengthen her back and womb vessels but in three days time she sent me word that she believed she should be troubled with the piles being somewhat costive and a little pained when she went to stool i therefore ordered her to take a large dose of the laxative electuary again the next morning betimes and to omit the pleasant specific electuary that day and so to take the laxative one once every three or four days if she found her self costive and the pleasant specific electuary constantly the other days for the remainder of the fortnight or till she was quite well and had perfectly recovered her strength  accordingly she took the quantity of a large wallnut of the laxative electuary the next morning which gave her two or three loose stools and wholly freed her from all apprehensions of the piles and the next day she began the pleasant specific electuary again and thus by following directions as above she was soon perfectly cured has had her courses in regular order never in the least been troubled with the whites or piles but lived in good health and strength ever since it being now four months ago  the other case that occurs to my mind was of a young gentlewoman of about eighteen years of age of a jolly sanguine complexion to whom i was sent for about three months since till a little before tha time she had always enjoyed perfect health but then was taken of a sudden with a violent fever and an exceeding flux of the courses when i came to her she had had them for ten or twelve days upon her and they still continued to flow in an exceeding large quantity  her fever notwithstanding the great loss of blood she had suffered being very high i ordered her to bleed immediately in the arm which in some measure diverted the course of the blood i did not give her my laxative electuary she being very weak and her stomach and bowels not foul but presently sent her my cooling anodyne powder and pleasant specific electuary directing her to take both in the manner above ordered for about four days she had not taken above six doses of each but her feverish heat was overcome and her courses stopped on the fourth day she happened to be a little griped therefore i ordered her to leave off the cooling anodyne powder and take only the pleasant specific electuary which she did for two or three days longer and it perfectly cured her she only remaining a little weak occasioned by the exceeding flux she had labored under but she soon recovered her strength without any more medicines and has remained well ever since there was no absolute necessity for her to continue the pleasant specific electuary any longer because the sudden hot fermentation of her blood which was the cause of her illness being taken off by bleeding and the cooling medicines the effects of course ceased without much fear of returning but in the gentlewomans case first mentioned it was quite different for her illness being caused by acrid salts in her blood and having continued a long time it had much injur d the wombvessels which could not be strengthened sufficiently nor her blood have been rectified as it ought without taking the pleasant specific electuary for a fortnight or more and indeed could the young gentlewoman have been persuaded to have taken it for nine or ten days longer which she refused it would have been the better for her for she would have thereby recovered more strength in one day than without it she did in three it being so excellently powerful in restoring persons weakened by that illness  chap iii of the exceeding pain and uneasiness some women endure just upon the coming down of their courses and of the bad color and ill smell of the blood that flows from some persons as also of the disorders women in tears are subject to when their courses begin to leave them among the disorders of the courses the misery that some women undergo just upon their coming down every time they flow is none of the least it being very grievous and dangerous  they are commonly afflicted with violent shooting pains in the head pain in the back stomach and bowels not much unlike the colic with most racking misery about the region of the womb and sometimes palpitation of the heart vapors convulsions etc all which proceed from wind or from the smallness of the vessels of the womb or from their being full o blood and their openings obstructed with a viscous matter so as not freely to afford it passage suitable to its extraordinary ferment which plainly appears by this that when the courses come down freely the symptoms presently abate and go off  if this indisposition be not remedied there will in time follow a total suppression or stoppage of the terms to prevent which and cure this disorder carminative anodyne hysteric and deobstructive medicines must be prescribed such as will effectually expel wind allay pain correct the viscofity of the juices and open all obstructions so as to give immediate ease to the patient in the fit and entirely prevent the return of that indisposition for the future  therefore assuredly to prevent what may ensue and entirely to be freed from this difficulty of the courses or uneasy indisposition the patient must take as soon as she perceives the approaching flux of the terms and is in pain six or eight spoonfuls of the following hysteric julep and continue to take the like quantity every three four or five hours as there is occasion till the courses flow freely or without much pain but no longer minding to lie down upon the bed and be covered very warm immediately after taking it it is thus made no   the hysteric julep take mugwort water pennyroyal water and ruewater of each two ounces bryony water compound treacle water and strong cinnamon water of each one ounce syrup of mugwort one ounce spirit of salt armoniack a dram liquid laudanum forty drops of my specific tinctare two drams mix for an hysteric julep    this hysteric julep will absolutely take off all manner of pain and uneasiness cause pleasant rest and sleep support the patients spirits strengthen her stomach expel wind open all obstructions enlarge the vessels through which the blood flows banish all the symptoms and finally cure the disorder for the time present  but effectually to cure this indisposition so as not to be liable to it for the future the patient when the present fit of pain is overcome and as soon as her courses cease to flow must begin my pleasant opening powder prescribed in the first chapter of this book page   and take it constantly and exactly as there directed for a whole month six weeks or longer which will assuredly free her from any future return of pain and uneasiness at the time the terms begin to flow entirely prevent all ill consequences of that indisposition and absolutely establish health and strength  in some women the courses are of various and ugly colors the blood that flows being yellowish livid black etc and sometimes has a very nauseous smell which disorders are caused by the badness of the whole mass of blood or its particular corruption in the vessels of the womb the blood and juices therefore must be purified and the whole body cleansed by proper cathartick and alterative medicines as the case requires but these indispositions are safely and speedily remedied by the following uterine drops the patient taking eighty or ninety of them or more first shaking the vial in a glass of white wind every morning fasting and at five a clock every afternoon for three weeks or a month together minding not to eat any thing for half an hour before or after each dose but to walk about pretty much after taking them they are made thus no   the uterine drops take of tartarizd elixir of property half an ounce mynsichts tincture of steel two drams spirit of penny royal a dram of my specific essence half a dram mix according to art and keep them for use    these admirable uterine drops will rectify the stomach and blood purity all the juices and powerfully cleanse the womb they resist all manner of corruption and putrefaction in a wonderful degree keep the body in good order and rather loose than bound and so particularly correct and extirpate all foul humors without any the least disorder that they effectually cause the terms to be of a good color and free from any ill scent etc except the blood is exceedingly corrupted indeed in which case besides these drops some powerful catharticks must be also taken at due intervals therefore if the patient after taking the uterine drops as before directed for three weeks or a month should find the next time the courses flow that the blood is not brought to its due color or that its strong smell is not perfectly gone which will very seldom happen then she must once every four or five days as strength will permit take a dose of my purging pills prescribed in the first chapter of this book page   aforegoing taking them betimes in a morning as is there directed and the intervening days she must take the uterine drops also as above ordered continuing this course for a month or six weeks together which will assuredly purify the whole mass of blood cleanse the wombvessels strike at the root of all corruption and putrefaction bring the courses to their natural color and perfectly take away all offensive smell restoring the patient to pristine health and good order  and here it will not be amiss to touch upon the disorders that most women labor under when being between forty or fifty years of age their courses begin first to dodge and at last to leave them for then they are frequently troubled with a severe pain in the head and back and about the loins sometimes also with colic pains gripes and looseness at other times with vapors to a violent degree likewise feverish heats and wandering rheumatick pains etc to prevent and cure all which no method or medicines are more proper and beneficial than my purging pills to be taken a dose every four or five days as before said and my uterine drops the other days in the same dose and manner as above directed and so continue them for a month or six weeks together or longer which then will assuredly have the desired effect  and thus i have gone through the weaknesses and indispositions that often attend the female sex occasioned by the irregularity of the menstrual flux or courses and have set down in a plain intelligible manner the best method of cure so as every one suffering under those afflicting illnesses may without trouble or revealing their case certainly cure themselves with the greatest safety ease and expedition imaginable  chap iv of the piles this distemper being common to men as well as to women it may be thought strange that i treat of it here but considering that many of the fair sex do not care to acquaint physicians that they are afflicted with the piles it made me conclude that this chapter would prove as serviceable and be as acceptable to them as the others  the indisposition called the haemorrhoids or piles is miserably painful making the patient exceeding restless fretful and faint it is a swelling and soreness of the haemorrhoid veins just within and sometimes just without the fundament when they do not bleed they are called the blind piles and then they generally swell much and cause violent pain and inexpressible torture at going to stool the bleeding piles though very sore are not so bad or dangerous as the other except the flux is exceeding violent and continues long for then it induces fainting swooning loss of strength citron like color of the skin resembling the jaundise evil habit of the body consumption dropsy etc  the cause of this illness is most commonly a rarefaction and fermentation of the blood and humors as the feverish disposition of the patient at that time plainly shows so that a redundancy of blood stoppage of the terms either accidentally or by irregular methods colds etc often occasion the piles by hindering the usual secretions and thereby inflaming the blood and putting it into a great ferment when filling the haemorrhoid veins if they easily open it issues out and if they do not it there stagnates and swells them etc as before mentioned sometimes the piles are caused by hard riding or other violent exercise also severe purging etc but in those cases the illness commonly goes off by ease rest and temperate living  if the blind piles continue long the swelling may grow scirrhous and an ulcer or fistula difficult to cure may succeed  to prevent which and cure the piles proper alterative and cooling medicines must be given inwardly to allay the ferment of the blood reduce its discracy and thereby destroy the prime cause of the distemper whilst suitable intrinsic remedies are outwardly applied to discuss the tumor ease pain and perfectly heal and cure the affected part  if the patient be feverish or the pain and inflammation great bleeding in the arm to the quantity of about ten ounces will be absolutely necessary to divert the humors after which let as much of the following alterative powder as will lie heapd upon a shilling be taken four times every day viz betimes in the morning fasting at eleven a clock in the forenoon at four a clock in the afternoon and at night going to bed the patient may take it in a spoonful of beer water gruel or any other small liquor she likes better drinking a little of the same made lukewarm after each dose no   the alterative powder take cream of tartar six drams liquorice powder and white amber prepared of each two drams and a half prunelstone two drams sweet salt of steel a dram of my mineral magistery two drams mix and make a fine powder according to art    this alterative powder will allay the violent ferment of the blood restrain its impetuosity cool and rectify the whole mass and obtund and correct all acrid or sharp humors to admiration  and at the same time the patient is taking this alterative powder let the following intrinsic liniment be used three or four times in a day or oftener applying it with a fine warm linen rag or with your warm fingers very gently to the affected part endeavoring when the piles are inward to get as much of the liniment up as can be it is thus made no  0 the intrinsic liniment take chemical oil of amber twenty four drops sugar of lead a dram ointment of poplar buds an ounce of my chemical oil for the piles half an ounce mix and make a liniment according to art    this intrinsic liniment quickly gives ease and mightily contributes to the cure of both blind and bleeding piles  thus the alterative powder must be constantly taken and the intrinsic liniment be carefully used according to these directions till the cure either of blind or bleeding piles is perfectly accomplished they will quickly give ease and assuredly complete the cure of the piles in a short time for the alterative powder effectually strikes at the first cause of that illness and prevents the parts being supplied with sharp humors while the intrinsic liniment after an admirable manner eases all pain discusses the tumor or swelling of the blind piles and heals and perfectly cures the bleeding  the alterative powder agrees with the stomach and takes off all feverish heat without disordering the body in the least it sometimes makes the belly a little loose and thereby contributes very much to the cure for nothing is more tormenting to those troubled with the piles than to be costive or hard bound it putting them to intolerable pain and misery at going to stool  therefore if the alterative powder should not loosen the belly it will be necessary for the patient once every two or three days to take a dose of my laxative electuary prescribed in the second chapter of this book page    aforegoing taking it exactly as is there directed minding only to omit taking the alterative powder that day the laxative electuary is taken  the patient during the time she is afflicted with the piles ought to drink freely of water gruel tea or posset drink made small and carefully abstain from strong liquors spices salt meats etc which tend to inflame and increase the malady  thus these directions being truly observed this grievous indisposition which some labor under many months will be perfectly cured in a little time so as not to return again  about three months ago i was sent for to a genlewoman who had been afflicted with the piles almost continually for some years she having taken very many medicines to little or no purpose told me she feared she should never be cured yet least she should be wanting to her self hearing of my skill was the reason she had sent for me and desired i would use my utmost endeavor to free her if possible from her illness she acquainted me also that sometimes they bled pretty much and then she was much easier than when they only swelled and did not she was at that time in much torment and being of a hot constitution and something feverish i ordered her immediately to be blooded and prescribed my alterative powder and intrinsic liniment the first to be taken and the latter to be used exactly as i have directed in this chapter for a week or nine days at the end of which she was very well and better as she affirmed than she had been for any time in nine months before nevertheless i ordered her by all means to continue the alterative powder for a fortnight or three weeks longer without using the intrinsic liniment any more  my ordering her to take the alterative powder so long was with design to correct her blood and wholly subdue the acrid principle or cause of that severe malady that had so long afflicted her which it effectually did she having been very well ever since and likely so to continue  much about the same time i had another woman under my care who was also sorely troubled with the piles her blood was very acrid but she was not exceeding feverish yet was then in exceeding pain and a little before she sent for me the piles had bled very much i therefore did not order her to be blooded but directed her to take my alterative powder and use my intrinsic liniment presently and continue them till she was cured in four days time she was tollerably well but happening to be costive i directed her to take a dose of my laxative electuary once every three or four days and to take the alterative powder as directed on the other days which she did and was perfectly cured in a fortnights time  i could give many more instances of persons cured of the piles by these remedies who by reason of their being exceeding bad and having been so long afflicted with them imagined they could never be cured but designing brevity i shall wave that trouble  what i have here wrote concerning the piles may prove as beneficial to men troubled with them as to women for the method and medicines i have prescribed infallibly cure that illness in both sexes  chap v of the whites this disease is the flowing of a white humor from the cervical glandules or vessels about the neck of the womb  the whites sometimes come away in large and sometimes in but small quantities are attended with pain in the small of the back pain in the head want of appetite bad digestion weariness restlessness sometimes swelling of the legs pale countenance etc maids of a weakly constitution are often afflicted with this malady as well as married women and widows  if this distemper be not timely remedied it certainly causes incurable barrenness and the blood and juices become more and more depauperated till a deplorable consumption or dropsy etc ushers in death to end the melancholy tragedy  there are few women especially of the weaker sort but at one time or other are afflicted with this illness it being a distemper often attendant upon and caused by other diseases and whatever disease reduces a woman to a languid weakly frame it is commonly succeeded by this indisposition thus women that are naturally of a more weak habit or constitution than ordinary are more subject to the whites than others and as this illness is mostly occasioned by foregoing distempers though sometimes by sudden frights violent exercise immoderate venery etc so it weakens the body also more and more till the suffering patient becomes a miserable victim to death being brought into a hopeless consumption dropsy etc as aforesaid unless cured by proper remedies administered by a skilful hand  but the immediate cause of the whites is a weakness laxity or looseness of the cervical glandules or vessels about the neck of the womb whose tone is either spoiled by the ill constitution of the stomach and blood depraved by other distempers or by some of the accidents immoderate exercise etc before mentioned by which means those vessels cannot sufficiently retain the proper humor separated by them from the blood to lubricate or moisten the neck of the womb etc but let it gleet or slide away in too large a quantity thereby impoverishing the juices of the body inevitably causing barrenness if not timely cured and bringing the whole humane frame into a pining desperate state  some women indeed have this white flux much more moderate than others and not continually but at times only without causing any great or remarkable prostration of strength till a year or two or more after its first beginning to appear but then it becomes more violent and dangerous weakening the body excessively and as it were at once and is then much more hard to cure this being a known and undoubted truth that the longer this flux of white matter has afflicted the patient and the larger in quantity it is the longer time will be required and the more difficult will it be to accomplish the cure the humors being the more habituated to flow that way and the tone of the glandules or vessels through which they flow being the more spoiled  many authors write that if the whites continue long they degenerate and become variously colored as green etc and some times smell intollerably ill but in all the women i ever had under my care for this illness i never could find any such discolored flux when there was not reason to suspect another disease which makes me absolutely of the opinion that a greenish flux is never seen but where it takes its rise from a more malignant distemper which must then be managed wholly after a different manner from the illness i here treat of otherwise the patient may be ruined  it is of great moment therefore carefully to distinguish the whites from other distempers that resemble that malady for numbers of women who have met with ill husbands have labored under a venereal running or a running caused by the foul disease for some years together still imagining it to be only the whites others have mistaken a running occasioned by an ulcer in the womb for that flux thus it being very difficult for women to distinguish these distempers and yet absolutely necessary that they should i think it here very proper to give some rules by which they may assuredly know one from the other  the whites may be certainly distinguished from a gonorrhaea or venereal running by this that whenever the courses come down the whites always cease and do not trouble the patient again till a little while after the courses have done flowing whereas a venereal running remains constantly upon the patient and does not cease during the flux of the terms but continues all they time they flow as well as before and after  the whites may also be distinguished from an ulcer in the womb by this that an ulcer in the womb is always attended with very sharp and gnawing pains in the womb and its neck from the very beginning of the disease whereas in the whites though sometimes the humor may be so sharp as to cause smarting in the outer parts yet there is no such sharp pain felt in those iner parts  the cure of the whites must first be endeavored if strength will admit by cleaning the stomach and bowels with catharticks and afterward by rectifying the blood and juices strengthening the vessels of the womb and restoring the weakened body to its pristine vigor with alterative balsamic and subastringent medicaments  the patient therefore to prevent the dismal effects that may ensue and entirely to cure the whites if she is not exceeding weak indeed must take a dose two or three as she thinks most proper or finds her self able to bear of the purging pills prescribed in the first chapter of this book page   aforegoing taking them exactly as is there directed excepting only that instead of four pills she must take but three of them for a dose the first time because persons afflicted with the whites are commonly much easier to be purged than those troubled with a stoppage of the terms  three or four of those purging pills will give four five or six stools without the least trouble or disorder neither griping the bowels or making the patient sick but being taken every other or every third morning for two or three times as strength will bear will admirably cleanse the body of foul humors and prepare it for other remedies to finish the cure  therefore as soon as the patient has purged two or three times according to her own discretion and as her constitution will allow she must the next day take the quantity of a very large nutmeg of the following balsamic electuary every night and morning and at four a clock every afternoon also not eating any thing an hour before or after each dose but drinking a glass of red rough wne or of any strong wine more agreeable after it to wash it down no    the balsamic electuary take the finest dragons blood earth of japan bolearmoniack and candid nutmegs of each a dram and fifteen grains binding saffron of steel a dram and a half powder of boiled turpentine four drams of my chemical balm a dram and a half syrup of quinces a sufficient quantity to make an electuary according art    this balsamic electuary must be constantly taken till the person is perfectly cured which will soon be provided it be taken punctually as directed in some the cure will be accomplished in a fortnight or three weeks but in others whose illness is exceeding bad it may perhaps be a month or six weeks before it is quite finished but its sovereign efficacy may be depended upon for it will most certainly cure and all persons will from the first two or three days apparently find themselves mend exceedingly all the while they are taking it which may serve as a demonstration to them that by continuing it for a reasonable time the cure will be assuredly completed  therefore effectually to prevent a relapse i advise every one who begins this balsamic electuary not to leave it off notwithstanding they may find themselves in nine days or a fortnight pretty well cured of the whites but to continue taking it constantly as directed for a month five or six weeks which then will certainly prevent any return of that distemper  it never disorders the body but commonly keeps it rather loose than bound is pleasant to take and displays its virtues aster an admirable manner effectually answering all the intentions of cure for it strengthens the stomach and bowels purifies the blood and juices restores the wombvessels to their pristine order by gently straitning and reducing them to their natural tone it also wonderfully corroborates the whole body taking away all manner of weakness in the back etc rendering the patient lively brisk healthy and strong and perfectly putting an end to that troublesome distemper the whites  whilst the patient is under this course her food ought to be of very easy digestion and if she drinks a glass or two of wine at her meals it will be the better she must observe also to avoid eating sallets greens and all sorts of fruit  if the patient is troubled with the headache or is feverish then the day before she takes any medicines it will be highly proper for her to bleed in the arm to the quantity of eight or nine ounces  if she is exceeding weak and ill before she begins these medicines then she must not take the purging pills before recommended more than once or twice or not at all if she thinks she cannot bear purging but must begin to take the balsamic electuary immediately and continue it constantly till she is perfectly well and indeed for a week or fortnight afterward for it will thereby strengthen the body to such a degree and confirm the cure of the whites in such a manner as re prevent any relapse into the same for the future  as soon as the courses or any sign of them approach and indeed for two or three days before they are expected the balsamic electuary must be lest off and not be taken again till the terms have done flowing  some women that are very subject to be costive may happen to be bound in their bodies while they are taking the balsamic electuary though it most commonly proves otherwise in which case the patient may take a dose of the laxative electuary recommended in the second chapter of this book page    a foregoing as is there directed so as just to loosen her belly but not more observing only to omit taking the balsamic electuary that day the laxative one is taken  if the patient troubled with the whites labors at the same time under any disorder of the courses it will be proper for her first to get cured of that disorder as directed in the foregoing chapters before she attempts the cure of the whites as for example suppose a woman should be afflicted with a deficiency of the terms or their flowing but sparingly etc and with the whites also which frequently happens she must then first cure her self of the deficiency of the courses by taking the opening powder etc prescribed in the first chapter of this book p   exactly as there directed and when by that means her terms flow regularly and well and are of a good color etc then she ought to begin the remedies prescribed in this chapter for the cure of the whites but not before  i could give almost innumerable instances of persons cured of the whites by the method and medicines above described but shall only relate one or two cases the particulars of which i believe will prove acceptable to my readers  i was sent for about seven months since to a young gentlewoman about nineteen years of age who for three years before as i was informed had at times been troubled with this white flux but it not continuing constantly upon her nor flowing violently neither her self or mother much minded it till at last growing very bad the whites increasing in quantity her legs swelling and her whole body becoming more and more disordered they thought proper to seek for help  i found her in great distress her back much pained her appetite almost lost her legs a little swelled and the flux by her mothers relation very severe yet she was not exceeding feverish therefore i did not think fit to have her blooded but ordered her to take two doses of my purging pills before mentioned at two days distance from each other they operated very well took down the swelling of her legs and made her something better however being a little weakened i did not order her to purge again but directed her the next day to take my balsamic electuary as above and continue it constantly till she was cured  in about fourteen days the flux was so much abated as hardly to be perceived the pain in her back was nearly gone and she began to look brisk and recover strength but being always much subject to costiveness she was something bound in her body i therefore ordered her the day following to take a dose of my laxative electuary before mentioned just to loosen her bowels and if she found any further occasion to take a dose of it every five days and the balsamic electuary constantly the other days which she did for a fortnight longer in which time she was perfectly cured and has remained in complete health ever since  near six months ago a gentlewomen of about thirty years of age sent for me and desired my assistance she being exceedingly afflicted with the whites which she had been troubled with upwards of four years that illness began quickly after a miscarriage which had like to have proved her death and which was occasioned by a great fright  she told me she had taken abundance of medicines first by the advice of her midwife and an eminent apothecary and afterward by the direction of a physician of good note without receiving any benefit and added that she feared there was no cure for her but that she must dye yet desired i would do all in my power and save her life if possible for her childrens sake she having three alive  her case was exceeding bad indeed she was very ill and weak scarce able to stir had a violent pain in her head and back no appetite to food was frequently very feverish and almost wore to a skeleton by the great flux of white matter that she had so long labored under nevertheless i let her know that with the blessing of the almighty i did not doubt but to restore her to health provided she would follow my directions and take my medicines punctually which she readily promised to do  this gentlewoman was too weak to bear purging therefore i forbore ordering her my purging pills but considering the great pain in her head and that she was inclined to be feverish i directed her first to have about eight ounces of blood taken from her arm which without weakening her diverted the humors and prevented a fever which might otherwise have happened and the next day i ordered her to begin my balsamic electuary and continue it constantly as directed in this chapter  at the end of five days i found her mightily recovered the whites being nearly stopped her spirits revived her strength much encreasd the pain in her head and back almost entirely gone and her appetite in some measure come to her however she being something hot and uneasy by turns and not having purged at first because of her exceeding weakness i advised her though she was not in the least costive to take a dose of my laxative electuary once every five or six days and the balsamic electuary the other days as before and to continue that course till she was perfectly well and for nine or ten days after  accordingly she took my advice and in a month from the time she first began my medicines she left off taking them having been well for about a week before and was then and still remains in perfect health and strength to the admiration of all that knew her  chap vi of the bownfalling of the womb and fundament what is vulgarly called the downfalling of the womb is in reallity no such thing for there can be no outhanging of that without present death but the disorder commonly known by that name is an outhanging of the vagina or outer neck of the womb and is truly only the wrinkles of the sheath or passage relaxed and swollen so as to fall cut and appear something like a ball with a hole in the middle it is generally very painful and troublesome and sometimes so much inflamed as to threaten a gangrene  this indisposition is caused by straining or irritating the secret parts by hard labor in childbearing by the hand of an unskilful midwife by excessive venery or immoderate exercise as hard riding dancing leaping etc or by a violent flux either of the whites or courses which often not only relaxes or loosens the vagina but also frets or irritates it so as to cause it to become sore swell and hang down  the falling down of the fundament is an out hanging of the intestinum rectum or great gut and is caused by weakness and relaxation of its fibers or tearing of them either by severe costiveness violent straining in hard labor or sharp looseness etc it is not only troublesome but dangerous if not quickly remedied and oftentimes becomes the seat of a foul ulcer or fistula  in the cure of these illnesses the medicines that we give inwardly must be vulnerary and such as will endue the blood and juices with a balsamic property in order to strengthen and create an aptness in the relaxed fibers and swollen parts to recover their tone and retain their natural station when reduced or gently put up after peculiar emollient and moderately astringent fomentations have been externally applied  if the patient is costive particular care must be had to remove that disorder for straining at going to stool is not only painful but increases the malady as well that of falling down of the womb as the falling down of the fundament  if the part hanging down is inflamed or angry bleeding in the arm will be absolutely necessary after which in order certainly to cure these indispositions the parts affected must be bathed outwardly with my sanative fomentation which is thus made no    the sanative fomentation take of pomegranate peel two drams dried red roses pomegranate flowers of each half an handful oak bark half an ounce boil them in a quart of spring water till it comes to a pint which then strain out and while it is very hot add sugar of lead white vitriol and my healing salt of each one dram stir it about till the salts are dissolved and when cold add of common spirit of wine two ounces which mix well and reserve the whole for use    this sanative fomentation must be used thus pour a little of it into a well glazed pipkin or other earthen vessel and make it very hot over the fire then with a fine flannel cloth dipped into it bathe and foment therewith the part hanging out either of the fundament or womb as hot as can be well endured for a quarter or half an hour together after which the patient lying down let the part be gently put up by a tender hand and kept in its place by a truss or convenient bands of linen cloth minding to bathe those parts two or three times every day in the same manner for five or six days together though the part does not fall out again  by the use of this fomentation alone without taking medicines inwardly the falling down of the womb will be assuredly cured but in the falling down of the fundament especially if it be through great weakness it will be very necessary for the patient besides bathing the part affected with the sanative fomentation to take at the same time the balsamic electuary prescribed in the foregoing chapter page    as is there directed and it will wonderfully strengthen the parts etc whilst the sanative fomentation used outwardly will abate the swelling heal all soreness cause the relaxed fibers to regain their tone and keep the part affected in its natural situation  but if the patient is costive and the balsamic electuary should not cause loose stools as it generally will then the laxative electuary prescribed in the second chapter page    aforegoing must be taken as there directed in a morning fasting every third fourth or fifth day as the patient finds needful taking such a dose of it as will just give two or three loose stools but not more and minding to omit the balsamic electuary that day the laxative one is taken  it will be convenient also for those troubled with the down falling of the womb if they are costive to take the laxative electuary in like manner  thus these directions being punctually followed the falling down of the womb as it is vulgarly called and also of the fundament will be certainly and effectually cured  chap vii of barrenness as being the mother of children is the highest honor and most exalted state of satisfaction that the fair sex can attain to in a married life so on the contrary barrenness of all other misfortunes is by much the greatest producing the most severe affliction that can attend a family and causing the deepest secret grief in a woman that is possible to be imagined what discord what differences are bred in many of the best families for want of children to crown the earnest desires of married persons and what reproaches and melancholy reflections that want often occasions with the dismal disorders that from thence frequently arise may be easily conceived by judicious persons who will give themselves liberty to consider how great the sorrow of that woman must be who knows that could she have children she should be absolutely happy in a married state when for want of them she is perhaps treated with ignomy and contempt and made the most unfortunate of her sex  this being true it naturally follows that nothing is more necessary than to treat of and faithfully discover the causes and cure of barrenness in women when it is done with a real intent of being serviceable to the world in rendering such a considerable number of the fair sex fruitful and happy who with the last degree of sorrow now labor under the ungrateful imputation of being barren  and the more useful will it still appear when we consider that the natural excellent modesty of our women hinder them from openly seeking for a cure of that unfortunate circumstance which by means of the plain modest account i intend to give may be secretly remedied by themselves without the knowledge of others  it is to be understood here that i mean to write only of the cause and cure of barrenness in women of suitable years and not in those who are either too old or too young in the former when their terms have left them conception is impossible and the latter must contentedly wait till age has ripened and made them capable of childbearing for some women there are who being married very young conceive not till they are nineteen twenty or twenty two or three years of age or more and then become very fruitful and others that marrying betimes have children at fourteen or fifteen thus there is a very remarkable and manifest difference in the nature and ripeness of the female sex this being premised  i shall first show the several causes of barrenness and here by the way i cannot pass by what with concern i have often observed viz that many likely women have been deemed incurably barren lived uncomfortably many years and at last gone out of the world without bearing children for want only of their physicians having a true knowledge of the seemingly unaccountable cause which in all probability might have been easily removed by a proper method and fit medicines and the women have been rendered as capable of having children as any whatever but to proceed  the causes of barrenness are many as the visible ill structure or formation of the parts exceeding fatness scirrhous tumors or swellings in the neck of the womb ulcers etc in all which cases there cannot be a regular admission of the male seed so that it is impossible a conception should happen but as these causes are seldom seen and as rarely cured i shall not enlarge upon them other causes of barrenness are i the deficiency of the monthly terms and then the natural ferment of the blood and juices is wanting the lively desirous faculty is spoiled neither is the womb fit to receive the spirituous effluvia of the masculine seed that a conception might follow ii the immoderate flux of the courses which impoverishes the fluids weakens the whole body and thereby incapacitates a woman to conceive iii the whites slipperiness or over moistness of the womb which weaken it and its vessels plainly prevent conception by condensing or drowning as it were the vital spirits of the male seed and by that means causing sterility iv the swelling of the vagina or wrinkles of the privities so as to hang out of the body vulgarly called the downfalling of the womb which then hinders enjoyment   but there are yet other causes of barrenness that are not visible the women being in perfect health young brisk jolly and as likely to have children to all appearance and as they themselves believe as any in the world and by reason the causes of sterility in such women do not immediately appear the vulgar practitioners call them occult or unknown and indeed are so to them but to an ingenious physician who makes nature his study is expert in anatomy and who carefully searches into the abstruse principles and causes of things to such these pretended occult causes are well known easily accounted for and quickly removed and which i will unfold  but first it will be necessary in order to explain and fully lay open what may otherwise appear intricate to women and others in treating of these causes to show the nature of generation and how a foetus is produced  within the body of a woman on each side the outer part of the bottom of the womb at about eight fingers breadth distance from it are situated the ovaria so named from their likeness to the collection of little eggs found in the bodies of fowl these ovaria are of an oval figure a little flat on their upper part and about half as big as a mans testicles and are vulgarly called testicles or stones  in the ovaria there are several little ova or eggs almost like bladders contained in proper separate cells one of which eggs in the time of coition is foecundated or impregnated by the spirituous part or effluvium of the male seed cast to the womb which spirit or effluvium ascends from thence to the ovaria through the vessels called womb trumpets which are about four or five fingers breadth long and arise on each side from the bottom of the womb the upper part of these womb trumpets being wide and open embrace the ovaria in the time of enjoyment and dilate or open so as to give free passage to the effluvium or spirit of the masculine seed cast to the womb that it may instantly arrive at the ovaria where it stimulates acts upon and impregnates one of the little ova or eggs therein contained as before mentioned which then falls from its cell through one of the womb trumpets into the womb as a proper place assigned by nature for its reception where it is nourished grows bigger and becomes a foetus  if two or more of these little eggs happen to be foecundated or impregnated at the same time the woman then has twins or several children at a birth as is often seen  the falling of one of the little eggs from its cell in the ovaria through one of the womb trumpets into the womb often occasions an uncommon sensation and gentle shivering of the body after the conjugal act which is therefore a sign of conception it also causes a contraction of the inner neck or mouth of the womb so as perfectly to close it in order to retain the egg in the womb and prevent its slipping away till at the end of nine months the time allotted for its perfection and birth it is become ripe for expulsion and fit to live in the open air  and thus conception is caused and not by the fancied true and equal mixture of male and female seed as was the notion of the ancients for women have no such thing as seed other than the ovaria vulgarly called testicles before described  indeed in the time of coition most women void a white limpid humor which having some resemblance to seed might help to occasion the mistake of the ancients but modern discoveries demonstrate that this white liquor comes from the small pores of the vagina celled lacunae and not from the womb neither in the time of carnal conjunction does it go into the womb which is a plain proof that it is not seed but that it is only designed by nature to create desire in women lubricate the passage to the womb and to cause exceeding pleasure in the conjugal act  now it must be allowed that it is most likely a woman should conceive at the moment this white liqour is voided provided the male seed is at that instant emitted also because then the woman feels excessive delight which occasions the mouth of the womb to open and receive the spirituous part of the masculine seed the womb trumpets also dilate or widen to such a degree as to give passage to the little egg which when impregnated falls from its cell in the ovaria through one of them into the womb as before taught  and thus having discovered how generation and conception happens i shall proceed to treat of the causes of barrenness which do not plainly appear and are not known to women themselves which now from what follows may be easily conceived by persons of tolerable sense and reason  the causes then that hinder conception in women of suitable years brisk and not laboring under any apparent weakness or indisposition must be either an obstruction of the womb trumpets which then hinders the spirituous part of the masculine seed from passing through them to the ovaria without which impregnation or conception cannot happen or from the faultiness of the ova or eggs contained in the ovaria so as they are incapable of being impregnated by the vital effluvia of the male seed that conception might follow or else from an inappitency to matrimonial pleasure in general which last is common to women of a cold constitution in whom the spirits flow not to the lower parts they feel no pleasure in coition the womb contracts its inner neck closes and for want of warm desires in the mind gives not but refuses a suitable reception to the effluvia of the male seed and so absolutely hinders conception  thus having shown the causes of barrenness as well those that are deemed occult or unknown as those that are obvious to common practitioners and women themselves i shall in the next place point out the true and direct method of cure  first then if conception be hindered by diseases as the deficiency or want of the courses immoderate flowing of the terms the whites slipperiness of the womb outhanging or bearing down of the swelled vagina etc then recourse must be immediately had to the method and medicines appointed for their cure under their proper heads in the foregoing chapters and when the patient is thereby brought into good order has her courses regular and her body is in an apparent healthy state then if she does not quickly conceive must be administered proper uterine medicines cordial and strengthening and which have a peculiar faculty to prepare fortify and invigorate the parts appropriated to generation and make a woman prolifick of which nature are the medicaments i shall by and by prescribe  now when barrenness proceeds from obstruction or stoppage of the womb trumpets or from the faultiness of the ova or eggs in the ovaria which causes do not appear otherwise than in their effect or from defect or want of convenient amorous desire then and in all these cases endeavors must be used to attenuate the blood and juices rouse and increase the animal spirits cause them to act with ardour to revive the whole humane frame and create mirth and particularly to rectify all disorders of the genital parts by such salubrious medicines as are specificated to open obstructions of the womb trumpets and at the same time adapted to comfort and strengthen the whole body nourish increase and fill the ova or eggs in the ovaria make them apt and ready to be foecundated or impregnated and also to correct and drive away the saturnine habit and all supperfluous cold moist humors which deaden desires to matrimonial pleasure and thereby destroy even the very intent of that divine institution such medicines i say must be given as will replenish the blood and juices and revive an inclination to conjugal enjoyment so that it may no more be burdensome as it is to some women but suitably acceptable that thereby happy issue may be the consequence  in the first place therefore those who have reason to believe their not conceiving proceeds from the forementiond occult unknown or not apparent causes must take the following prolifick elixir which will open any stoppage or obstruction of the womb trumpets fit and prepare the ova or eggs for impregnation rectify the blood and juices and correct all vicious qualities thereof no    the prolifick elixir take fine aloes and myrrh in powder of each six drams best russia castor in powder and choice english saffron well picked of each three drams chemical powers of sage baum clary comfry eringo and amber of each two drams of tartarizd spirit of wine half a pint mix the chemical powers and spirit of wine first which then pour upon the other ingredients and digest them in a sand heat for ten days or till a very deep strong elixir is obtained which after it is well settled decant from the faeces and add to it my tincture of mars and chemical prosifick oil of each two ounces mix them very well by shaking and keep the whole close stopped for use    of this elixir the patient must take eighty or ninety drops first shaking the vial every morning fasting and at five a clock every afternoon also in a glass of white wine not eating any thing for about an hour before or after each dose thus it must be taken constantly for three weeks or a month according to the patients own discretion and then forbearing that it will be highly proper for her to take the quantity of a large wallnut of the following powerful confect every night and morning and also at four a clock every afternoon with a glass of good canary or other choice generous wine which confect will certainly incline and dispose the patient to conceive for it increases the spirits revives exhilerates and strengthens to admiration makes the ova or eggs in the ovaria full ripe and apt to be foecundated widens the womb trumpets etc and thereby absolutely removes all natural causes of barrenness no    the powerful confect take of chemical powers of vipers a dram confect of chermes berries three drams confect of satyrion roots two ounces and an half of my stimulating essence eighteen drops mix and make a confect according to art    this powerful confect is exceeding pleasant to the palate is certainly the most effectual medicine for barrenness that ever was made in the world and may be taken for a month together or longer  if the patient believes her not conceiving is occasioned through natural coldness of constitution only then she need not take the prolifick elixir but begin to take the powerful confect immediately which will in most cases prove sufficiently efficacious yet taking the prolifick elixir first is undoubtedly the surest way  but if the patient be of an exceeding cold constitution and should find as may possibly happen that the powerful confect does not sufficiently answer the intention then it will be convenient for he besides taking the powerful confect just to anoint the secret parts with a very little of the following stimulating balm either by means of a feather dipped in it or otherwise which being used outwardly and the powerful confect taken inwardly at the same time will assuredly have the desired effect and promote conception in an extraordinary manner no    the stimulating balm take adeps rosarum and essence of limontime of each half a dram essence of orangeflowers two drams essence of cloves three drams essence of limons six drams and half oil of jessamine five ounces and of my provocative chemical powers one ounce first mix the adeps rosarum the essences and my chemical powers and then add the oil of jessamine and make a stimulating balm which if done according to art will be very odoriferous and finely transparent    this stimulating balm is not nauseous to use but has a pleasant fragrant scent and proves excellently serviceable  if by using it much the parts should at any time be overheated so as to cause any uneasiness then presently wash and bathe them for near half an hour together with warm milk and water and the heat or uneasiness will be immediately taken off  men may be cured of impotency by the medicines prescribed in this chapter as well as women of barrenness for the prolifick elixir admirably corrects any ill quality of the seed the powerful confect increases it and that as well as the stimulating balm is equally proper and beneficial for men afflicted with imbecility as for women and may be taken and used by them in the same manner  and now having directed to the most proper method and effectual medicines for the cure of barrenness i shall end this chapter with advising all women who desire to be the honorable mothers of children not to use venery too often for that very commonly occasions sterility or barrenness from the due observation of which and punctually following the directions i have given with the greatest reason in the world may be expected happy conception and hopeful issue unless for grievous sins god is pleased to deny that most valuable blessing therefore above all let incessant prayers be put up to the almighty who had promised to hear the afflicted and who can instantly make the barren fruitful and the most disconsolate glad  while i was writing this chapter a gentleman came to return me thanks and gratify me for the service i had done his lady the case was this about six months ago he acquainted me that he had been married to a brisk handsome young woman above five years without having any children or her being once with child which occasioned great sorrow to them both and sometimes contention between them the gentleman alleging that it was not his fault and the lady being as confident which from all outward appearance she might that it was not hers after he had informed me of the whole matter i concluded that his wifes not conceiving was occasioned by obstruction or narrowness of the womb trumpets and therefore gave him a bottle of my prolifick elixir which i believed would render her fruitful with direction for her to take it for a fortnight or three weeks constantly as i have ordered in this chapter which he persuaded her to and she conceived quickly after being now to her great joy as well as her husbands above four months gone with child  another gentleman near three quarters of a year since let me know that he had been married pear seven years without having children and that his wife being of a cold constitution he believed that was the cause of her not conceiving which was my opinion also i therefore ordered her my powerful confect to be taken for a fortnight together or more as i have directed in this chapter which she took and without using my stimulating balm it had such effect that she quickly conceived and is now near the time of her delivery  i could here insert cases of abundance of women that i have had under my care for the cure of barrenness and who by the very method and medicines above prescribed have been made fruitful so that they quickly after conceived but the book in general and this chapter in particular having swelled beyond my first intention i shall save my readers the trouble of reading and my self that writing any farther on this head  chap viii of miscarriage with directions how to cause speedy delivery in childbirth and also how to rectify the disorders of the lochia or childbed purgations as there is nothing more unpleasing than to be disappointed of expected and wished for issue through miscarriage so nothing proves more dangerous to the female sex than that unhappy misfortune for it being unnatural is always attended with ill symptoms and proves much worse than a regular childbirth and though a woman recovers the immediate danger of losing her life by a miscarriage yet if she is frequently afflicted in the same manner it certainly ruins her constitution weakens the whole body brings on incurable illnesses and necessarily shortens life  and it is a grievance that often becomes habitual to the fair sex many women miscarrying five or six and some ten or twelve times following one another exactly at a certain length of time after conception thus miscarriage happens to some always in the third month of their going with child to others in the fourth fifth sixth seventh or eighth and then it is much more dangerous than in the first two or three months  the oftener a woman has miscarried the more difficult will it be to cause her to retain the fruit of her womb the whole nine months that divine providence has appointed for ripening a natural birth for when a woman is accustomed to miscarry the womb at the usual time endeavors with its utmost efforts to eject its burden  miscarriage is commonly caused the first time by a sudden fright violent blow or fall or longing for things seen without having them either of which causes a contraction of the womb and a kind of convulsive motion so as to expel the foetus in a word whatever irritates the womb and excites the expulsive and weakens the retentive faculty procures miscarriage so that a great cold immoderate exercise intemperate eating drinking too much wine in the first months excessive passion either of anger joy fear grief etc or disorder of the kidneys or of the bowels the redundancy and rarefaction of the blood flagginess of the womb want of spirits through prodigious bleedings also vehement coughing sneezing or vomiting may occasion this great unhappiness  the imminent symptoms that threaten immediate miscarriage are an heaviness and weight about the loins a bearing down of the womb pain of the back and pains from the navel downwards also trembling palpitation of the heart shivering inappetency laziness flagginess of the breasts flux of matter from the womb etc all or any of which portend miscarriage  if there is reason to believe that the foetus is already separated from the womb the expulsion of it must not be hindered but on the contrary be promoted as much as may be by the assistance of a skilful midwife or physician practicing that art and such remedies must be given as will hasten its expulsion and by their forcing quality speedily ease the womb of its then dangerous burden for which end i recommend the following expulsive cordial a spoonful or two of which the patient must take every now and then first shaking the bottle and it will cause the womb to expel the foetus or child though dead with admirable and unexpected ease  for which reason it is also wonderfully serviceable to those in labor who have gone out their whole time for being taken as before directed when the pains relent or are weak it brings them on kindly and causes a speedy and easy delivery no    the expulsive cordial take bryony water compound treacle water and strong cinnamon water of each half an ounce baum water and chamomile water of each one ounce mugwort water and penny royal water of each two ounces and an half testicles of an horse prepared four scruples tincture of castor two drams tincture of saffron one dram spirit of salt armoniack two scruples salt of amber one scruple chemical oil of savin oil of aniseeds and oil of chamomile first mixed with a little white powder sugar of each three drops of my forcing salt two scruples syrup of mugwort one ounce and an half mix and make a cordial according to art    this expulsive cordial has excellent effects in the aforementioned cases and is truly the most proper medicine in the world to remedy a hard or slow labor for it is not only powerfully forcing but also eases and comforts the woman strengthens the child and disposes the womb to expel its burden with ease and safety provided the child is in a right posture and fit to be expelled which an ingenious midwife may presently know for if it be not that and all other forcing medicines will do more hurt than good and prove dangerous and therefore must be avoided till by the hand of a skilful midwife the birth is made to present right and then the expulsive cordial being given as before directed will soon display its wonderful efficacy and speedily cause an happy delivery  and if after delivery the lochia or childbed purgations do not come down regularly then a spoonful or two of the expulsive cordial being given to the patient according to the discretion of her midwife will prove very serviceable and bring down the flux freely  but to return to miscarriage if the foetus or child be not separated nor the blood vessels broke endeavors by all possible means must then be used to confirm the tone of the ligaments strengthen the womb and corroborate the foetus for which purpose such medicines must be immediately given as are comforting balsamic subastringent temperate in respect to heat and that have a power to absorb all irritating or sharp humors which often cause a contraction of the womb and expulsion of the birth  therefore if a woman has never miscarried but being with child is frightened or receives a blow fall etc so as to endanger a miscarriage i advise her instantly to drink a glass two or more of strong florence or barabar claret there being nothing better on those occasions for it recovers and raises the spirits depressed by frights etc and at the same time by its noble astringent quality strengthens the womb and its vessels burntclaret may also be drank to good effect after which if any symptoms of miscarrying continue the patient must take from the point of a knife the quantity of a large nutmeg of my specific electuary prescribed for the immoderate flux of the courses in the second chapter of this book page    a foregoing as soon as can be and continue to take the same quantity of it three times every day viz every night and morning and at three or four a clock every afternoon till all danger of miscarrying is over minding to drink a glass of the aforementioned wine or other agreeable liquor after each dose and it will assuredly prevent miscarriage  but if the patient has miscarried once or several times before then it will be highly necessary for her to begin to take the specific electuary as before directed a week or more before the last or usual time of her miscarrying and continue it till a week or fortnight after the time she most fears though she has no symptoms of miscarrying by which means she will certainly prevent that misfortune though she has miscarried many times before  for it powerfully corroborates the womb and its vessels confirms and establishes the tone of the ligaments that keep the birth fixed to the womb and strengthens the foetus more than can be expressed it also comforts the stomach and bowels absorbs all acrid or sharp humors and fortifies the spirits exceedingly therefore the longer it is taken during a woman is with child the more secure will she be of going out her whole time with safety ease and health yet about the last month of her time if no danger of miscarrying appears it will be proper for her to leave taking it because it strengthens the membranes ligaments and vessels so exceedingly that being taken too near the time of delivery it may possibly cause her labor to be something more hard than otherwise it would  if after a woman is brought to bed the lochia or childbed purgations should flow violently so as to make it necessary to restrain the flux then a few doses of the specific electuary being given to the patient by advice of her midwife will do infinite good  if the patient during the time of taking the specific electuary to prevent her miscarrying should happen to he costive or very hard bound then it will be necessary for her to take some very gentle medicine just to loosen her belly every now and then as she finds occasion for which purpose a small dose of the laxative electuary prescribed in this book page    aforegoing being taken will prove very proper  if the symptoms of miscarriage are occasioned by longing for things seen etc whatever they be they ought immediately to be procured if possible  and if the patient is of a sanguine complexion and full of blood it will not be amiss for her to be presently blooded to the quantity of eight ounces  thus i have given all the necessary directions concerning miscarriage etc which being duly followed will certainly have the desired effect as the number of women i have cured of the habit of miscarrying by the method herein set down evinces  about two years ago a gentlewoman near thirty years of age came to me much afflicted having miscarried ten times before and always about the third month she was very desirous to be cured of that faculty and was then about nine or tea weeks gone with child and began to have some symptoms of approaching miscarriage i therefore ordered her to take my specific electuary as i have directed in this chapter and to continue it constantly for six weeks at least which she did and without taking any think else she was cured went out her whole time and brought into the world a healthy boy and so complete was the cure that since that she has had another child without taking any medicines or having the least sign or fear of miscarriage  note it being a common thing for women who are afflicted with illness to leave off taking medicines after the worst symptoms of their indispositions are taken off and before they are perfectly cured i could not here omit advising them to avoid that practice and to keep to the course of medicines that they enter into regularly for the whole time they are directed otherwise they cannot expect less than to relapse into their diseases again which will then give them double trouble increase the expense and prove more difficult to cure  finis a catalogue of all the medicines prescribed in this book and
