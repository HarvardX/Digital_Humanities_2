the country election a farce in two acts london sold by s hooper near the new church in the strand m dcc lxviii  dramatis personae men sir harry simple a shallow fellow of small fortune in love with maria candidate for the county of artful a popular hypocritical man the other candidate in opposition to sir harry trueman a man of some fortune in the interest of artful in love with maria mr wealthy a man of great opulence determined to marry his daughter to none but a member of parliament crafty quirk two false friends to sir harry but in his interest smut a blacksmith blunt a surly farmer landlord puritan countryman women mrs wealthy wife to wealthy maria her daughter in love with trueman betty the maid in the interest of maria mrs blunt wife to blunt wife to puritan waiters children mob and attendants  the representation of particular scenes is submitted to mr hogarths excellent prints of an election  the country election act i scene i a room enter maria and betty meeting betty lord miss maria not dressed yet  why therell be a world of folks here presently  especially as my master has given it out that he intends keeping open house till the day of election in favor of sir harry simple   maria dont talk to me of dress nor sir harry neither i hate him  i wish he had been fixed to a stake and burnt yesterday instead of his effigy   betty o fie miss you should not wish such cruel wishes as that   maria indeed i do but prithee trouble me no more about him have you seen mr trueman today   betty love as the saying is has given him wings i saw him fly by the house once or twice but could not get to speak to him he is purely busy in squire artfuls cause not indeed out of any respect to him but merely to oppose that goose simple  well i do think it a whimsical notion of my master not to marry his daughter but to one of those yeaandnay creatures called a member of parliament   maria marry betty  why if he carries his election i will not have him  i would run to scotland first  a poor shallowpated fop so he may save himself both the trouble and expense   betty so say i miss to be sure mr trueman is a much more properer man and as we say in our country has got some guts in his brains   maria if it was not for my mamma my pappa would be well enough but she is always dinging in his ears family places interest and such stuff for my part i dont see what interest she would have if all her relations were in parliament unless it were to frank her nonsense into every part of the kingdom which now she cannot convey without adding something to the revenue   betty why there would be something in that and not the worse for us for the more she would write the less she would talk but  bless me who comes yonder if mr trueman is not coming through the hall in disguise with some of the folks   maria is he indeed  run then betty and take care neither my pappa and mamma comes into the room while he is here   betty make good use of your time for depend upon it you cannot be long together   exit enter trueman in boots disguised like a countryman trueman looking about hist  maria  are we alone   maria i would not for the world mr trueman any of the family should see you here i should lead a weary life if they did   trueman it happens very fortunately for us that your father now keeps open house as i can slip in and out unperceived i provided this dress on purpose as in case we should be seen together i may pass off undiscovered   maria twas a good thought but tell me how have you sped   trueman as well as i could wish i do believe the days our own artful readily accepted of my services and i have been indefatigable in his interest up night and day you see my life what you can spur me to i shall think my labor well repaid if but at last i call maria mine   maria i make no doubt but both my pappa and mamma may be brought to give their consent if we can but upset this scheme of simples   trueman never doubt it i will try my best for it i havnt been within a pair of sheets these six nights no messenger or mailcarrier has rid at once more miles with greater expedition than i in canvassing this country for votes but when love dictates its votaries must obey   maria indeed mr trueman i am greatly obliged to you and heartily wish you may succeed   trueman pray heaven we may but believe me it is hot work simple though a mere fool seems to have plenty of money which he makes fly like wild fire and gold maria in this as well as in every other case is the most prevailing argument a man can use i could get no admittance any where without first showing my ticket indeed artfuls tongue being so well oiled saves him many a guinea the women are all in his interest and then you know the men they follow of course   maria if gaining the favor of the women mr trueman is necessary he could not have a better friend on this occasion than you   trueman bows gad so your mother   betty without loud miss marias in the next room maam shall i call her   mrs w without no no i will go to her   enter betty frightened running before and mrs wealthy in seeming haste when she sees trueman she stops short maria to truem i am persuaded sir your giving your vote to sir harry will greatly oblige my father   mrs w who is this man daughter   maria he tells me he belongs to the next parish mamma that he is a freeholder and has influenced several neighbors in favor of sir harry   truem in a feigned voice an i had twenty votes i would gee um aal to he if it were only on squoire wealthys account   betty aside faith leave him alone for a scheme o he is a charming man   mrs w confused my good neighbor i beg your pardon  i thought it had been some  indeed sir i thank you and when mr wealthy sees you he shall thank you too i assure you sir harry is a very fine gentleman and more than that is determined if chose right or wrong always to vote against the court aside to maria i tell him so you know though that would not be the way to swell our interest and get a place for your cousin tom to trueman for the court  well go backward friend into the saloon you will see many of your acquaintance there and get something to refresh you for you seem almost choked with dust   exit truem looking at maria maria aside a lucky escape indeed   mrs w come girl go get your cap on at present you are hardly fit to be seen i expect sir harry here shortly twill be a charming thing maria if he gets chose for the county twill be the making of us all your father shall have a place in the chequer for he loves to be counting of money i will be mistress of the robes you shall be a woman of the bedchamber and as for cousin tom he shall be  what shall he be  no matter i will think for him byandby   betty and i madam you have forgot me   mrs w behave but well and you shall be  let me see  you shall be  sweeper of the mall   maria ay but mamma    mrs w come away away dont stand talking i have always told you one talker in a familys enough go

cistern up in the saloon and let it run with port wine till the clock strikes four  going and  stay  returning let me see  tell will  are the two ventilators fixed i am sure we shall have need of them for the whole house smells now as hot and frouzy as a beggars bedchamber with these dirty fellows in it  hah why dont you answer me   betty they are maam   mrs w well  then you may go  betty going but hearkye returning tell will i would have him wait above going and  returning let that new sleepy fellow with the scripture name there    betty hezekiah   mrs w ay i dont know what you call him  tell him to attend the door keep both his eyes open and watch that nothing is taken out of the house betty going and  returning see that every thing is as it should be   exit betty if every thing was as it should be one would think your tongue should be tired but that is out of the nature of things   exit scene ii a village enter artful booted with a paper in his hand and landlord on his canvass artful

the best gemman   artf  st mob i say you lie   simp  d mob interfering no quarrelling no quarrelling let both have fair play  now pray friend tell us why squire artfuls a better man than sir harry simple   artf  st mob because  he is  for experiment he is not above speaking to us but talks to any of us as if as how we was his acquaintance   artf  d mob he went to see my dame and was so lovingly fond of her as thoff she would been madam he squeezed her so close and hugged her and kissed her as thoff he would have eat her up sue was ready to die away in his arms for joy   simp  d mob if that

exit mob hollowing before gad nothing like a little gold to make one beloved  crafty if gold will do and faith i never knew it fail yet we shall carry it in spite of artfuls devilish hypocrisy   quirk i never was fond of clandestine proceedings  but  however of two evils we are to choose the least now bribery alone is not so bad as bribery and hypocrisy together   sir harry let artful salve over the matter as he pleases if he gives but a penny he comes within the oath as much as if he gave a pound   quirk and let him give it under what pretense he will in foro conscientiae it is bribery nevertheless therefore we have this satisfaction that if we are no better than other people thank heaven and our own virtue we are no worse   sir harry to crafty have you ordered the music and cleavers to meet us in cocksheethollow on wednesday morning in time   crafty i have appointed them there by ten lest artfuls party should parade it into town before us   sir harry warmly confound artful and his party too double my numbers quirk and not suffer the scoundrels to enter the town at all   quirk no  that will not do  that will not do were we to carry it under those circumstances it would be deemed no election they would bring it into the house and swear their voters could not poll for fear of their lives   sir harry well gentlemen i shall leave these matters wholly to you i hope there is not much doubt of success   crafty nothing is certain but by what i can see we have as good as if not better of it than artful   quirk you must spare no expense if you do in my opinion it is over with you artfuls plea upon all occasions is i am no courtier though twas but the other day i saw him following the breech of my lord msawney into the great house at the bottom of st jamess street   sir harry you should tell some devilish lie or another  cannot you say that i will get the militia bill and the beer act repealed or  tell em i will get an act passed that every man shall be at liberty to leave his wife at the expiration of three years if he does not like her and marry again   crafty ha ha ha i dont know what that indeed might do but as to the militia bill and the beer act they will now go no more down with the people than stale small beer to a man that is not thirsty   sir harry apart twill be confounded hard to lose it after spending so much money  lose it  i must not think of it  if i do i am ruined  i have been now obliged to borrow a considerable sum however if i get the girl she has fortune enough to set all to rights again   quirk apart to crafty who shall touch him for the next five hundred you or i   crafty apart to quirk no matter which  i will you had the last to sir harry why so thoughtful sir harry keep up your spirits man or we lose the cause   sir harry i have been considering gentlemen how much i am obliged to you what could i have done without you should i succeed you shall not find me ungrateful   quirk should  let us not suppose a doubt  money must certainly carry it the generality of freeholders especially the lower sort would not only sell their country but they would part with their wives and children could they get any thing for em   crafty the great inconsistency of these people often makes me smile they sell themselves and then wonder and are displeased at being sold   sir harry before gad that is true enough to quirk how have you done in the lower part of the county   quirk damn the lower part i found em as mercenary and venal as they could well be many of them turned up their noses at five pieces i was obliged to give them ten and at one place i was under a necessity of entertaining the girls with the humors of mr punch that cost me fifty i should have done nothing if i hadnt for the tongues of the men and women in that place are like the strings of a fiddle equally tuned in perfect unison what one cries the other answers   sir harry the women in some places have a wonderful attraction ha ha ha have you crafty finished in the upper part   crafty not quite i have a parish or two to canvass yet indeed i should not have been here hadnt i got to the bottom of my purse  i must have another five hundred  sir harry taking out a pocket book and giving him a note must you blessings go with it then nothing venture they say nothing have a day or two now will determine all my friend wealthy has opened his house in my interest and i have promised to attend him every day between this and wednesday therefore you must excuse me i presume i shall see you some time tomorrow you will find me either there or at the old place   exit quirk now we are alone tell me crafty how you succeeded last week   crafty i will deal frankly with you for rogues are generally honest to one another  i made a complete thousand  i got a cool hundred out of one parish   quirk then you have done better than i for what with presents balls feasting and puppetshews i havnt been able to save quite seven hundred and when i gave him in the account he thought i had been too profuse   crafty zounds man you dont take the right step did you make the landlords of public houses your friends tip them but a piece or two extraordinary and they will give you a receipt for double the money you spend they darent cry out for fear of betraying themselves   quirk all that i took care to do   crafty did you enter in your account so much to ringers so much to fiddlers so much to tatlers   quirk tatlers who are they   crafty why the old women   quirk indeed i never thought of them   crafty not fee the old women then you havnt done either sir harry or yourself justice  it would not only have swelled the account but tip an old womans tongue with gold and she will talk you off in such gilded strains as shall do you more essential service than all you give besides oh  the old women the tatlers as i call them have a power of talking you black or white just as disposition leads em whatever you do  secure the old women   quirk live and learns an old proverb  i presume you include the parson and the apothecary in the number of the old women   crafty doubtless  they are the belweathers of a parish they are the main springs that set the female tongue agoing nothing in this point can ever be done without the parson and the apothecary   quirk it is impossible simple could have employed a better man in this business than you crafty you seem perfectly acquainted with it and can fall in with the taste of all ranks of people  i will be bold to say you will eat drink lie swear and whore with any man in the three kingdoms   crafty ha ha ha necessity has no law there is no carrying the point without it the better we keep up the spirit of the thing the greater advantage we shall reap i would see simple at the devil before i would take so much pains if i had not a feeling in it if he is returned he marries the girl her fortune is paid and i hope we shall have some of the fingering it if not as we shall have the bonds he has given us ready in force well execute the writs and secure the money while he has any to pay apeing sir harry i have been considering gentlemen how much i amobliged to you  hah quirk  but come let us away well defer our settling till the business is done   exeunt scene iv a room in an alehouse enter artful and landlord artf i hope she will send him back again landlord   landl no fear your honor  i never knew her gean to falsifications in my born days   artf well make us a bowl of your best punch probably he may be here by that time  exit landlord never was i more at a loss in my life than i am at present how i shall heat this surly wretch apply to him i must as i am told he has great influence among his neighbors  it is according as it hits  i shall be heartily glad when this days over   reenter landlord landl measter blunts just come your honor   artf oh he is  pray desire him to walk in  and bring the liquor exit landl now must i have all my wits about me   reenter landlord with a bowl of punch and blunt artf running and squeezing blunt by the hand my dear friend mr blunt i am heartily glad to see you   blunt aside mayhap so but it is for his own ends i suppose  why had not he kissed me as he did my wife to artf your servant sir what is your business with me   artf as to business mr blunt  well leave that alone i never talk of business so abruptly  come sit down and take a glass of punch   blunt aside i never am against that   artf you have no objections to our landlords company i hope   blunt none at all bluffers an honest fellow   they all sit artf here is your good health mr blunt   drinks blunt thank you sir  to yours   drinks artf landlord fill your glass and drink to our good friend here   landl measter blunt my service to you   drinks blunt shaking his head aside all this will not do to landl measter bluffer i thank you   artf what is the best news mr blunt in this part of the country   blunt news quother  this damned militia bill continues to make such confusion in this place that i wish that mans tail had been on fire that first proposed it   artf i am very sorry you should entertain so bad an opinion   blunt interrupting him sorry  bad an opinion  pox on it  dont tell me that we are to maintain the brats of a parcel of lazy idle scoundrels that at certain times make it their business to loiter about the country pilfering and stealing every thing they can lay their hands on no no mr artful  sir harry simple thinks as i do   artf whatever sir harry may think i am convinced the act has now been so long established it is out of any mans power to alter it   blunt and then there is your beer and cider act  add to that the exorbitant price of provisions  look about look about the poor are starving every where   artf starving mr blunt   blunt aping artf starving mr blunt  yes starving  would you have em eat horsedung   artf bread seems to be the most material thing and i cannot see how they can lower the price of that without injuring the farmer rents are dear taxes are high and hands scarce   landl indeed they are no one can tell where the shoe pinches so well as he that wears it i havnt above ten acres and yet i can feel it   blunt bread neighbor bluffers the least on it let em take the taxes off other articles and then we shall see who is to fault the parliament or the farmer   artf nothing would make me happier than to have it in my power to be instrumental to the good of my countrymen give me leave to drink to your good families health landlord here is mrs blunt and her little ones  drinks  all

that respect is a free man and i have this opinion of mr blunt that no money or interest will induce him to give his vote from his friend   blunt aside but youre damnably mistaken   artf to blunt and i flatter myself my good man that i have always lived in such repute as to have the voice of every one in this place and among the rest that of yours   blunt aside adod  that is flattery with a vengeance    artf but come my friend drink the other glass helps him here is prosperity to this place  they all drink   blunt i dont know you called on my wife she tells me   artf about two hours ago

betty betty the continual noise and hurry in this house ever since my master has opened his doors has almost made me distracted there is nothing done but running backwards and forwards all day long i never saw so much eating and drinking in any house since i have been a servant guttle guttle guttle and then as to liquor in my mind as fast as they pour it in it runs out i do believe john hasnt emptied our large pewter jordan less than twenty times this morning  going out meets maria entering a letter from mr trueman miss   giving a letter maria is any one waiting   betty the man that brought it said it did not require an answer   maria reads the letter it is only to tell me he will take the first opportunity of seeing me tomorrow after the election is over  i hope simple will lose it both for my sake and the sake of this poor county for such a representative he would make as was never seen before   betty pray fortune he may  though he could say aye  or  no  as well as the best and few of them ever say more  heavens be praised this is the last day for i am sure the house has been topsy turvy for this week past   maria where is my pappa   betty making a beast of himself with

obliged to borrow a large sum on account of this election that he depended on success and thought to have repaid it with my daughters fortune that he has been betrayed by quirk and crafty that bonds he is given are put in execution against him that he has not a farthing left has therefore gone out of the way and says nothing can retrieve him but an alliance with my family  a mighty pretty scoundrel  this wife is your doing    mrs w my doing mr wealthy you know as how we thought he was a man of fortune or i never should have consented to his marrying my daughter   maria it is well pappa

have him and i am resolved my soninlaw shall be in parliament   maria indeed pappa mr trueman is possessed of such good qualities as do honor to the gentleman though he is not so rich as some you are
