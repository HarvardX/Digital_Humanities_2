      the life of the author                                            i consider an human soul without education like marble in      the quarry which shows none of its inherent beauties till      the skill of the polisher fetches out the colours makes the      surface shine and discovers every ornamental cloud spot      and vein that runs through the body of it education after      the same manner when it works upon a noble mind draws out      to view every latent virtue and perfection which without      such helps are never able to make their appearance

persuaded that i never entertained a thought of appearing in public when the desire of being useful to one dear child in whom i take the tenderest interest induced me to write the following lettersperhaps it was the partiality of friendship which so far biassed your judgment as to make you think them capable of being more extensively useful and warmly to recommend the publication of them though this partiality could alone prevent your judgment from being considered as decisive in favour of the work it is more flattering to the writer than any literary fame if however you will allow me to add that some strokes of your elegant pen have corrected these letters i may hope they will be received with an attention which will insure a candid judgment from the reader and perhaps will enable them to make some useful impressions on those to whom they are now particularly offered  they only who know how your hours are employed and of what important value they are to the good and happiness of individuals as well as to the delight and improvement of the public can justly estimate my obligation to you for the time and consideration you have bestowed on this little work as you have drawn it forth i may claim a sort of right to the ornament and protection of your name and to the privilege of publicly professing myself with the highest esteem      madam      your much obliged friend       and most obedient         humble servant              hester chapone    letters on the improvement of the mind     letter i  on the first principles of religion       my dearest niece  though you are so happy as to have parents who are both capable and desirous of giving you all proper instruction yet i who love you so tenderly cannot help fondly wishing to contribute something if possible to your improvement and welfare and as i am so far separated from you that it is only by pen and ink i can offer you my sentiments i will hope that your attention may be engaged by seeing on paper from the hand of one of your warmest friends truths of the highest importance which though you may not find new can never be too deeply engraven on your mind some of them perhaps may make no great impression at present and yet may so far gain a place in your memory as readily to return to your thoughts when occasion recalls them and if you pay me the compliment of preserving my letters you may possibly reperuse them at some future period when concurring circumstances may give them additional weightand thus they may prove more effectual than the same things spoken in conversation but however this may prove i cannot resist the desire of trying in some degree to be useful to you on your setting out in a life of trial and difficulty your success in which must determine your fate for ever  hitherto you have thought as a child and understood as a child but it is time to put away childish things you are now in your fifteenth year and must soon act for yourself therefore it is high time to store your mind with those principles which must direct your conduct and fix your character if you desire to live in peace and honour in favour with god and man and to die in the glorious hope of rising from the grave to a life of endless happinessif these things appear worthy your ambition you must set out in earnest in the pursuit of them virtue and happiness are not attained by chance nor by a cold and languid approbation they must be sought with ardour attended to with diligence and every assistance must be eagerly embraced that may enable you to obtain them consider that good and evil are now before you that if you do not heartily choose and love the one you must undoubtedly be the wretched victim of the other your trial is now begun you must either become one of the glorious children of god who are to rejoice in his love for ever or a child of destructionmiserable in this life and punished with eternal death hereafter surely you will be impressed by so awful a situation you will earnestly pray to be directed into that road of life which leads to excellence and happiness and you will be thankful to every kind hand that is held out to set you forward in your journey  the first step must be to awaken your mind to a sense of the importance of the task before you which is no less than to bring your frail nature to that degree of christian perfection which is to qualify it for immortality and without which it is necessarily incapable of happiness for it is a truth never to be forgotten that god has annexed happiness to virtue and misery to vice by the unchangeable nature of things and that a wicked being while he continues such is in a natural incapacity of enjoying happiness even with the concurrence of all those outward circumstances which in a virtuous mind would produce it  as there are degrees of virtue and vice so are there of reward and punishment both here and hereafter but let not my dearest niece aim only at escaping the dreadful doom of the wickedlet your desires take a nobler flight and aspire after those transcendent honours and that brighter crown of glory which await those who have excelled in virtue and let the animating thought that every secret effort to gain his favour is noted by your allseeing judge who will with infinite goodness proportion your reward to your labours excite every faculty of your soul to please and serve him to this end you must inform your understanding what you ought to believe and to doyou must correct and purify your heart cherish and improve all its good affections and continually mortify and subdue those that are evilyou must form and govern your temper and manners according to the laws of benevolence and justice and qualify yourself by all means in your power for an useful and agreeable member of society all this you see is no light business nor can it be performed without a sincere and earnest application of the mind as to its great and constant object when once you consider life and the duties of life in this manner you will listen eagerly to the voice of instruction and admonition and seize every opportunity of improvement every useful hint will be laid up in your heart and your chief delight will be in those persons and those books from which you can learn true wisdom  the only sure foundation of human virtue is religion and the foundation and first principle of religion is in the belief of the one only god and a just sense of his attributes this you will think you have learned long since and possess in common with almost every human creature in this enlightened age and nation but believe me it is less common than you imagine to believe in the true godthat is to form such a notion of the deity as is agreeable to truth and consistent with those infinite perfections which all profess to ascribe to him to form worthy notions of the supreme being as far as we are capable is essential to true religion and morality for as it is our duty to imitate those qualities of the divinity which are imitable by us so is it necessary we should know what they are and fatal to mistake them can those who think of god with servile dread and terror as of a gloomy tyrant armed with almighty power to torment and destroy them be said to believe in the true godin that god who the scriptures say is lovethe kindest and best of beings who made all creatures in bountiful goodness that he might communicate to them some portion of his own unalterable happinesswho condescends to style himself our father and who pitieth us as a father pitieth his own children can those who expect to please god by cruelty to themselves or to their fellowcreaturesby horrid punishments of their own bodies for the sin of their soulsor by more horrid persecution of others for difference of opinion be called true believers have they not set up another god in their own minds who rather resembles the worst of beings than the best nor do those act on surer principles who think to gain the favour of god by senseless enthusiasm and frantic raptures more like the wild excesses of the most depraved human love than that reasonable adoration that holy reverential love which is due to the pure and holy father of the universe those likewise who murmur against his providence and repine under the restraint of his commands cannot firmly believe him infinitely wise and good if we are not disposed to trust him for future events to banish fruitless anxiety and to believe that all things work together for good to those that love him surely we do not really believe in the god of mercy and truth if we wish to avoid all remembrance of him all communion with him as much as we dare surely we do not believe him to be the source of joy and comfort the dispenser of all good  how lamentable it is that so few hearts should feel the pleasures of real piety that prayer and thanksgiving should be performed as they too often are not with joy and love and gratitude but with cold indifference melancholy dejection or secret horror it is true we are all such frail and sinful creatures that we justly fear to have offended our gracious father but let us remember the condition of his forgiveness if you have sinned sin no more he is ready to receive you whenever you sincerely turn to himand he is ready to assist you when you do but desire to obey him let your devotion then be the language of filial love and gratitude confide to this kindest of fathers every want and every wish of your heart but submit them all to his will and freely offer him the disposal of yourself and of all your affairs thank him for his benefits and even for his punishmentsconvinced that these also are benefits and mercifully designed for your good implore his direction in all difficulties his assistance in all trials his comfort and support in sickness or affliction his restraining grace in time of prosperity and joy do not persist in desiring what his providence denies you but be assured it is not good for you refuse not any thing he allots you but embrace it as the best and properest for you can you do less to your heavenly father than what your duty to an earthly one requires if you were to ask permission of your father to do or to have any thing you desire and he should refuse it to you would you obstinately persist in setting your heart upon it notwithstanding his prohibition would you not rather say my father is wiser than i am he loves me and would not deny my request if it was fit to be granted i will therefore banish the thought and cheerfully acquiesce in his will how much rather should this be said of our heavenly father whose wisdom cannot be mistaken and whose bountiful kindness is infinite love him therefore in the same manner you love your earthly parents but in a much higher degreein the highest your nature is capable of forget not to dedicate yourself to his service every day to implore his forgiveness of your faults and his protection from evil every night and this not merely in formal words unaccompanied by any act of the mind but in spirit and in truth in grateful love and humble adoration nor let these stated periods of worship be your only communication with him accustom yourself to think often of him in all your waking hoursto contemplate his wisdom and power in the works of his handsto acknowledge his goodness in every object of use or of pleasureto delight in giving him praise in your inmost heart in the midst of every innocent gratificationin the liveliest hour of social enjoyment you cannot conceive if you have not experienced how much such silent acts of gratitude and love will enhance every pleasure nor what sweet serenity and cheerfulness such reflections will diffuse over your mind on the other hand when you are suffering pain or sorrow when you are confined to an unpleasant situation or engaged in a painful duty how will it support and animate you to refer yourself to your almighty fatherto be assured that he knows your state and your intentions that no effort of virtue is lost in his sight nor the least of your actions or sufferings disregarded or forgottenthat his hand is ever over you to ward off every real evil which is not the effect of your own illconduct and to relieve every suffering that is not useful to your future wellbeing  you see my dear that true devotion is not a melancholy sentiment that depresses the spirits and excludes the ideas of pleasure which youth is fond of on the contrary there is nothing so friendly to joy so productive of true pleasure so peculiarly suited to the warmth and innocence of a youthful heart do not therefore think it too soon to turn your mind to god but offer him the first fruits of your understanding and affections and be assured that the more you increase in love to him and delight in his laws the more you will increase in happiness in excellence and honourthat in proportion as you improve in true piety you will become dear and amiable to your fellowcreatures contented and peaceful in yourself and qualified to enjoy the best blessings of this life as well as to inherit the glorious promise of immortality  thus far i have spoken of the first principles of all religion namely belief in god worthy notions of his attributes and suitable affections towards himwhich will naturally excite a sincere desire of obedience but before you can obey his will you must know what that will is you must enquire in what manner he has declared it and where you may find those laws which must be the rule of your actions  the great laws of morality are indeed written in our hearts and may be discovered by reason but our reason is of slow growth very unequally dispensed to different persons liable to error and confined within very narrow limits in all if therefore god vouchsafed to grant a particular revelation of his willif he has been so unspeakably gracious as to send his son into the world to reclaim mankind from error and wickednessto die for our sinsand to teach us the way to eternal lifesurely it becomes us to receive his precepts with the deepest reverence to love and prize them above all things and to study them constantly with an earnest desire to conform our thoughts our words and actions to them  as you advance in years and understanding i hope you will be able to examine for yourself the evidences of the christian religion and be convinced on rational grounds of its divine authority at present such inquiries would demand more study and greater powers of reasoning than your age admits of it is your part therefore till you are capable of understanding the proofs to believe your parents and teachers that the holy scriptures are writings inspired by god containing a true history of facts in which we are deeply concerneda true recital of the laws given by god to moses and of the precepts of our blessed lord and saviour delivered from his own mouth to his disciples and repeated and enlarged upon in the edifying epistles of his apostleswho were men chosen from amongst those who had the advantage of conversing with our lord to bear witness of his miracles and resurrectionand who after his ascension were assisted and inspired by the holy ghost this sacred volume must be the rule of your life in it you will find all truths necessary to be believed and plain and easy directions for the practice of every duty your bible then must be your chief study and delight but as it contains many various kinds of writingsome parts obscure and difficult of interpretation others plain and intelligible to the meanest capacityi would chiefly recommend to your frequent perusal such parts of the sacred writings as are most adapted to your understanding and most necessary for your instruction our saviours precepts were spoken to the common people amongst the jews and were therefore given in a manner easy to be understood and equally striking and instructive to the learned and unlearned for the most ignorant may comprehend them whilst the wisest must be charmed and awed by the beautiful and majestic simplicity with which they are expressed of the same kind are the ten commandments delivered by god to moses which as they were designed for universal laws are worded in the most concise and simple manner yet with a majesty which commands our utmost reverence  i think you will receive great pleasure as well as improvement from the historical books of the old testamentprovided you read them as an history in a regular course and keep the thread of it in your mind as you go on i know of none true or fictitious that is equally wonderful interesting and affecting or that is told in so short and simple a manner as this which is of all histories the most authentic  in my next letter i will give you some brief directions concerning the method and course i wish you to pursue in reading the holy scriptures may you be enabled to make the best use of this most precious gift of godthis sacred treasury of knowledge may you read the bible not as a task nor as the dull employment of that day only in which you are forbidden more lively entertainmentsbut with a sincere and ardent desire of instruction with that love and delight in gods word which the holy psalmist so pathetically felt and described and which is the natural consequence of loving god and virtue though i speak this of the bible in general i would not be understood to mean that every part of the volume is equally interesting i have already said that it consists of various matter and various kinds of books which must be read with different views and sentiments the having some general notion of what you are to expect from each book may possibly help you to understand them and heighten your relish of them i shall treat you as if you were perfectly new to the whole for so i wish you to consider yourself because the time and manner in which children usually read the bible are very illcalculated to make them really acquainted with it and too many people who have read it thus without understanding it in their youth satisfy themselves that they know enough of it and never afterwards study it with attention when they come to a maturer age  adieu my beloved niece if the feelings of your heart whilst you read my letters correspond with those of mine whilst i write them i shall not be without the advantage of your partial affection to give weight to my advice for believe me my own dear girl my heart and eyes overflow with tenderness while i tell you with how warm and earnest prayers for your happiness here and hereafter i subscribe myself      your faithful friend        and most affectionate aunt     letter ii  on the study of the holy scriptures   i now proceed to give my dear niece some short sketches of the matter contained in the different books of the bible and of the course in which they ought to be read  the first book genesis contains the most grand and to us the most interesting events that ever happened in the universe the creation of the world and of manthe deplorable fall of man from his first state of excellence and bliss to the distressed condition in which we see all his descendants continuethe sentence of death pronounced on adam and on all his race with the reviving promise of that deliverance which has since been wrought for us by our blessed saviourthe account of the early state of the worldof the universal delugethe division of mankind into different nations and languagesthe story of abraham the founder of the jewish people whose unshaken faith and obedience under the severest trial human nature could sustain obtained such favour in the sight of god that he vouchsafed to style him his friend and promised to make his posterity a great nation and that in his seedthat is in one of his descendantsall the kingdoms of the earth should be blessed this you will easily see refers to the messiah who was to be the blessing and deliverance of all nations it is amazing that the jews possessing this prophecy among many others should have been so blinded by prejudice as to have expected from this great personage only a temporal deliverance of their own nation from the subjection to which they were reduced under the romans it is equally amazing that some christians should even now confine the blessed effects of his appearance upon earth to this or that particular sect or profession when he is so clearly and emphatically described as the saviour of the whole world the story of abrahams proceeding to sacrifice his only son at the command of god is affecting in the highest degree and sets forth a pattern of unlimited resignation that every one ought to imitate in those trials of obedience under temptation or of acquiescence under afflicting dispensations which fall to their lot of this we may be assured that our trials will be always proportioned to the powers afforded us if we have not abrahams strength of mind neither shall we be called upon to lift the bloody knife against the bosom of an only child but if the almighty arm should be lifted up against him we must be ready to resign him and all we hold dear to the divine will this action of abraham has been censured by some who do not attend to the distinction between obedience to a special command and the detestably cruel sacrifices of the heathens who sometimes voluntarily and without any divine injunctions offered up their own children under the notion of appeasing the anger of their gods an absolute command from god himselfas in the case of abrahamentirely alters the moral nature of the action since he and he only has a perfect right over the lives of his creatures and may appoint whom he will either angel or man to be his instrument of destruction that it was really the voice of god which pronounced the command and not a delusion might be made certain to abrahams mind by means we do not comprehend but which we know to be within the power of him who made our souls as well as bodies and who can control and direct every faculty of the human mind and we may be assured that if he was pleased to reveal himself so miraculously he would not leave a possibility of doubting whether it was a real or an imaginary revelation thus the sacrifice of abraham appears to be clear of all superstition and remains the noblest instance of religious faith and submission that was ever given by a mere man we cannot wonder that the blessings bestowed on him for it should have been extended to his posterity this book proceeds with the history of isaac which becomes very interesting to us from the touching scene i have mentioned and still more so if we consider him as the type of our saviour it recounts his marriage with rebeccathe birth and history of his two sons jacob the father of the twelve tribes and esau the father of the edomites or idumeansthe exquisitely affecting story of joseph and his brethrenand of his transplanting the israelites into egypt who there multiplied to a great nation  in exodus you read of a series of wonders wrought by the almighty to rescue the oppressed israelites from the cruel tyranny of the egyptians who having first received them as guests by degrees reduced them to a state of slavery by the most peculiar mercies and exertions in their favour god prepared his chosen people to receive with reverent and obedient hearts the solemn restitution of those primitive laws which probably he had revealed to adam and his immediate descendants or which at least he had made known by the dictates of conscience but which time and the degeneracy of mankind had much obscured this important revelation was made to them in the wilderness of sinah there assembled before the burning mountain surrounded with blackness and darkness and tempest they heard the awful voice of god pronounce the eternal law impressing it on their hearts with circumstances of terror but without those encouragements and those excellent promises which were afterwards offered to mankind by jesus christ thus were the great laws of morality restored to the jews and through them transmitted to other nations and by that means a great restraint was opposed to the torrent of vice and impiety which began to prevail over the world  to those moral precepts which are of perpetual and universal obligation were superadded by the ministration of moses many peculiar institutions wisely adapted to different endseither to fix the memory of those past deliverances which were figurative of a future and far greater salvationto place inviolable barriers between the jews and the idolatrous nations by whom they were surroundedor to be the civil law by which the community was to be governed  to conduct this series of events and to establish these laws with his people god raised up that great prophet moses whose faith and piety enabled him to undertake and execute the most arduous enterprises and to pursue with unabated zeal the welfare of his countrymen even in the hour of death this generous ardour still prevailed his last moments were employed in fervent prayers for their prosperity and in rapturous gratitude for the glimpse vouchsafed him of a saviour far greater than himself whom god would one day raise up to his people  thus did moses by the excellency of his faith obtain a glorious preeminence among the saints and prophets in heaven while on earth he will be ever revered as the first of those benefactors to mankind whose labours for the public good have endeared their memory to all ages  the next book is leviticus which contains little besides the laws for the peculiar ritual observance of the jews and therefore affords no great instruction to us now you may pass it over entirely and for the same reason you may omit the first eight chapters of numbers the rest of numbers is chiefly a continuation of the history with some ritual laws  in deuteronomy moses makes a recapitulation of the foregoing history with zealous exhortations to the people faithfully to worship and obey that god who had worked such amazing wonders for them he promises them the noblest temporal blessings if they prove obedient and adds the most awful and striking denunciations against them if they rebel or forsake the true god i have before observed that the sanctions of the mosaic law were temporal rewards and punishments those of the new testament are eternal these last as they are so infinitely more forcible than the first were reserved for the last best gift to mankindand were revealed by the messiah in the fullest and clearest manner moses in this book directs the method in which the israelites were to deal with the seven nations whom they were appointed to punish for their profligacy and idolatry and whose land they were to possess when they had driven out the old inhabitants he gives them excellent laws civil as well as religious which were ever after the standing municipal laws of that people this book concludes with moses song and death  the book of joshua contains the conquests of the israelites over the seven nations and their establishment in the promised land their treatment of these conquered nations must appear to you very cruel and unjust if you consider it as their own act unauthorized by a positive command but they had the most absolute injunctions not to spare these corrupt peopleto make no covenant with them nor shew mercy to them but utterly to destroy them and the reason is givenlest they should turn away the israelites from following the lord that they might serve other gods   the children of israel are to be considered as instruments in the hand of the lord to punish those whose idolatry and wickedness had deservedly brought destruction on them this example therefore cannot be pleaded in behalf of cruelty or bring any imputation on the character of the jews with regard to other cities which did not belong to these seven nations they were directed to deal with them according to the common law of arms at that time if the city submitted it became tributary and the people were spared if it resisted the men were to be slain but the women and children saved   yet though the crime of cruelty cannot be justly laid to their charge on this occasion you will observe in the course of their history many things recorded of them very different from what you would expect from the chosen people of god if you supposed them selected on account of their own merit their national character was by no means amiable and we are repeatedly told that they were not chosen for their superior righteousnessfor they were a stiffnecked people and provoked the lord with their rebellions from the day they left egyptyou have been rebellious against the lord says moses from the day that i knew you   and he vehemently exhorts them not to flatter themselves that their success was in any degree owing to their own merits they were appointed to be the scourge of other nations whose crimes rendered them fit objects of divine chastisement for the sake of righteous abraham their founder and perhaps for many other wise reasons undiscovered to us they were selected from a world overrun with idolatry to preserve upon earth the pure worship of the one only god and to be honoured with the birth of the messiah amongst them for this end they were precluded by divine command from mixing with any other people and defended by a great number of peculiar rites and observances from falling into the corrupt worship practised by their neighbours  the book of judges in which you will find the affecting stories of samson and of jephtha carries on the history from the death of joshua about two hundred and fifty years but the facts are not told in the times in which they happened which makes some confusion and it will be necessary to consult the marginal dates and notes as well as the index in order to get any clear idea of the succession of events during that period  the history then proceeds regularly through the two books of samuel and those of kings nothing can be more interesting and entertaining than the reigns of saul david and solomon but after the death of solomon when the ten tribes revolted from his son rehoboam and became a separate kingdom you will find some difficulty in understanding distinctly the histories of the two kingdoms of israel and judah which are blended together and by the likeness of the names and other particulars will be apt to confound your mind without great attention to the different threads thus carried on together the index here will be of great use to you the second book of kings concludes with the babylonish captivity     years before christ till which time the kingdom of judea had descended uninterruptedly in the line of david  the first book of chronicles begins with a genealogy from adam through all the tribes of israel and judah and the remainder is the same history which is contained in the books of kings with little or no variation till the separation of the ten tribes from that period it proceeds with the history of the kingdom of judah alone and gives therefore a more regular and clear account of the affairs of judah than the book of kings you may pass over the first book of chronicles and the nine first chapters of the second book but by all means read the remaining chapters as they will give you more clear and distinct ideas of the history of judah than that you read in the second book of kings the second of chronicles ends like the second of kings with the babylonish captivity  you must pursue the history in the book of ezra which gives an account of the return of some of the jews on the edict of cyrus and of the rebuilding the lords temple  nehemiah carries on the history for about twelve years when he himself was governor of jerusalem with authority to rebuild the walls c  the story of esther is prior in time to that of ezra and nehemiah as you will see by the marginal dates however as it happened during the seventy years captivity and is a kind of episode it may be read in its own place  this is the last of the canonical books that is properly historical and i would therefore advise that you pass over what follows till you have continued the history through the apocryphal books  the history of job is probably very ancient though that is a point upon which learned men have differed it is dated however    0 years before christ i believe it is uncertain by whom it was written many parts of it are obscure but it is well worth studying for the extreme beauty of the poetry and for the noble and sublime devotion it contains the subject of the dispute between job and his pretended friends seems to be whether the providence of god distributes the rewards and punishments of this life in exact proportion to the merit or demerit of each individual his antagonists suppose that it does and therefore infer from jobs uncommon calamities that notwithstanding his apparent righteousness he was in reality a grievous sinner they aggravate his supposed guilt by the imputation of hypocrisy and call upon him to confess it and to acknowledge the justice of his punishment job asserts his own innocence and virtue in the most pathetic manner yet does not presume to accuse the supreme being of injustice elihu attempts to arbitrate the matter by alleging the impossibility that so frail and ignorant a creature as man should comprehend the ways of the almighty and therefore condemns the unjust and cruel inference the three friends had drawn from the sufferings of job he also blames job for the presumption of acquitting himself of all iniquity since the best of men are not pure in the sight of godbut all have something to repent of and he advises him to make this use of his affliction at last by a bold figure of poetry the supreme being himself is introduced speaking from the whirlwind and silencing them all by the most sublime display of his own power magnificence and wisdom and of the comparative littleness and ignorance of man this indeed is the only conclusion of the argument which could be drawn at a time when life and immortality were not yet brought to light a future retribution is the only satisfactory solution of the difficulty arising from the sufferings of good people in this life  next follow the psalms with which you cannot be too conversant if you have any taste either for poetry or devotion they will be your delight and will afford you a continual feast the bible translation is far better than that used in the common prayer book and will often give you the sense when the other is obscure in this as well as in all other parts of the scripture you must be careful always to consult the margin which gives you the corrections made since the last translation and is generally preferable to the words of the text i would wish you to select some of the psalms that please you best and get them by heart or at least make yourself mistress of the sentiments contained in them dr delanys life of david will show you the occasions on which several of them were composed which add much to their beauty and propriety and by comparing them with the events of davids life you will greatly enhance your pleasure in them never did the spirit of true piety breathe more strongly than in these divine songs which being added to a rich vein of poetry makes them more captivating to my heart and imagination than any thing i ever read you will consider how great disadvantages any poems must sustain from being rendered literally into prose and then imagine how beautiful these must be in the original may you be enabled by reading them frequently to transfuse into your own breast that holy flame which inspired the writerto delight in the lord and in his laws like the psalmistto rejoice in him always and to think one day in his courts better than a thousand but may you escape the heartpiercing sorrow of such repentance as that of david by avoiding sin which humbled this unhappy king to the dust and which cost him such bitter anguish as it is impossible to read of without being moved not all the pleasures of the most prosperous sinner could counterbalance the hundredth part of those sensations described in his penitential psalms and which must be the portion of every man who has fallen from a religious state into such crimes when once he recovers a sense of religion and virtue and is brought to a real hatred of sin however available such repentance may be to the safety and happiness of the soul after death it is a state of such exquisite suffering here that one cannot be enough surprised at the folly of those who indulge in sin with the hope of living to make their peace with god by repentance happy are they who preserve their innocence unsullied by any great or wilful crimes and who have only the common failings of humanity to repent of these are sufficiently mortifying to a heart deeply smitten with the love of virtue and with the desire of perfection there are many very striking prophecies of the messiah in these divine songs particularly in psalm xxii such may be found scattered up and down almost throughout the old testament to bear testimony to him is the great and ultimate end for which the spirit of prophecy was bestowed on the sacred writersbut this will appear more plainly to you when you enter on the study of prophecy which you are now much too young to undertake  the proverbs and ecclesiastes are rich stores of wisdom from which i wish you to adopt such maxims as may be of infinite use both to your temporal and eternal interest but detached sentences are a kind of reading not proper to be continued long at a time a few of them well chosen and digested will do you much more service than to read half a dozen chapters together in this respect they are directly opposite to the historical books which if not read in continuation can hardly be understood or retained to any purpose  the song of solomon is a fine poem but its mystical reference to religion lies too deep for a common understanding if you read it therefore it will be rather as matter of curiosity than of edification  next follow the prophecies which though highly deserving the greatest attention and study i think you had better omit for some years and then read them with a good exposition as they are much too difficult for you to understand without assistance dr newton on the prophecies will help you much whenever you undertake this study which you should by all means do when your understanding is ripe enough because one of the main proofs of our religion rests on the testimony of the prophecies and they are very frequently quoted and referred to in the new testament besides the sublimity of the language and sentiments through all the disadvantages of antiquity and translation must in very many passages strike every person of taste and the excellent moral and religious precepts found in them must be useful to all  though i have spoken of these books in the order in which they stand i repeat that they are not to be read in that order but that the thread of the history is to be pursued from nehemiah to the first book of maccabees in the apocrypha taking care to observe the chronology regularly by referring to the index which supplies the deficiencies of this history from josephuss antiquities of the jews the first of maccabees carries on the story till within     years of our lords circumcision the second book is the same narrative written by a different hand and does not bring the history so forward as the first so that it may be entirely omitted unless you have the curiosity to read some particulars of the heroic constancy of the jews under the tortures inflicted by their heathen conquerors with a few other things not mentioned in the first book  you must then connect the history by the help of the index which will give you brief heads of the changes that happened in the state of the jews from this time till the birth of the messiah  the other books of the apocrypha though not admitted as of sacred authority have many things well worth your attention particularly the admirable book called ecclesiasticus and the book of wisdom but in the course of reading which i advise these must be omitted till after you have gone through the gospels and acts that you may not lose the historical thread i must reserve however what i have to say to you concerning the new testament to another letter      adieu my dear  footnotes     deut chap ii     ibid chap xx     deut chap ix ver        letter iii       my dearest niece  we come now to that part of scripture which is the most important of all and which you must make your constant study not only till you are thoroughly acquainted with it but all your life long because how often soever repeated it is impossible to read the life and death of our blessed saviour without renewing and increasing in our hearts that love and reverence and gratitude towards him which is so justly due for all he did and suffered for us every word that fell from his lips is more precious than all the treasures of the earth for his are the words of eternal life they must therefore be laid up in your heart and constantly referred to on all occasions as the rule and direction of all your actions particularly those very comprehensive moral precepts he has graciously left with us which can never fail to direct us aright if fairly and honestly applied such as whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you even so do unto them there is no occasion great or small on which you may not safely apply this rule for the direction of your conduct and whilst your heart honestly adheres to it you can never be guilty of any sort of injustice or unkindness the two great commandments which contain the summary of our duty to god and man are no less easily retained and made a standard by which to judge our own heartsto love the lord our god with all our hearts with all our minds with all our strength and our neighbour or fellowcreature as ourselves love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore if you have true benevolence you will never do any thing injurious to individuals or to society now all crimes whatever are in their remoter consequences at least if not immediately and apparently injurious to the society in which we live it is impossible to love god without desiring to please him and as far as we are able to resemble him therefore the love of god must lead to every virtue in the highest degree and we may be sure we do not truly love him if we content ourselves with avoiding flagrant sins and do not strive in good earnest to reach the greatest degree of perfection we are capable of thus do those few words direct us to the highest christian virtue indeed the whole tenor of the gospel is to offer us every help direction and motive that can enable us to attain that degree of perfection on which depends our eternal good  what an example is set before us in our blessed master how is his whole life from earliest youth dedicated to the pursuit of true wisdom and to the practice of the most exalted virtue when you see him at twelve years of age in the temple amongst the doctors hearing them and asking them questions on the subject of religion and astonishing them all with his understanding and answers you will say perhaps well might the son of god even at those years be far wiser than the aged but can a mortal child emulate such heavenly wisdom can such a pattern be proposed to my imitation yes my dear remember that he has bequeathed to you his heavenly wisdom as far as concerns your own good he has left you such declarations of his will and of the consequences of your actions as you are even now fully able to understand if you will but attend to them if then you will imitate his zeal for knowledge if you will delight in gaining information and improvement you may even now become wise unto salvation unmoved by the praise he acquired amongst those learned men you see him meekly return to the subjection of a child under those who appeared to be his parents though he was in reality their lord you see him return to live with them to work for them and to be the joy and solace of their lives till the time came when he was to enter on that scene of public action for which his heavenly father had sent him from his own right hand to take upon him the form of a poor carpenters son what a lesson of humility is this and of obedience to parents when having received the glorious testimony from heaven of his being the beloved son of the most high he enters on his public ministry what an example does he give us of the most extensive and constant benevolencehow are all his hours spent in doing good to the souls and bodies of mennot the meanest sinner is below his notice to reclaim and save them he condescends to converse familiarly with the most corrupt as well as the most abject all his miracles are wrought to benefit mankind not one to punish and afflict them instead of using the almighty power which accompanied him to the purpose of exalting himself and treading down his enemies he makes no other use of it than to heal and to save  when you come to read of his sufferings and death the ignominy and reproach the sorrow of mind and torment of body which he submitted towhen you consider that it was for all our sakesthat by his stripes we are healedand by his death we are raised from destruction to everlasting lifewhat can i say that can add any thing to the sensations you must then feel no power of language can make the scene more touching than it appears in the plain and simple narrations of the evangelists the heart that is unmoved by it can be scarcely human but my dear the emotions of tenderness and compunction which almost every one feels in reading this account will be of no avail unless applied to the true endunless it inspires you with a sincere and warm affection towards your blessed lordwith a firm resolution to obey his commandsto be his faithful discipleand ever to renounce and abhor those sins which brought mankind under divine condemnation and from which we have been redeemed at so dear a rate remember that the title of christian or follower of christ implies a more than ordinary degree of holiness and goodness as our motives to virtue are stronger than those which are afforded to the rest of mankind our guilt will be proportionably greater if we depart from it  our saviour appears to have had three great purposes in descending from his glory and dwelling amongst men the first to teach them true virtue both by his example and precepts the second to give them the most forcible motives to the practice of it by bringing life and immortality to light by showing them the certainty of a resurrection and judgment and the absolute necessity of obedience to gods laws the third to sacrifice himself for us to obtain by his death the remission of our sins upon our repentance and reformation and the power of bestowing on his sincere followers the inestimable gift of immortal happiness  what a tremendous scene of the last day does the gospel place before our eyesof that day when you and every one of us shall awake from the grave and behold the son of god on his glorious tribunal attended by millions of celestial beings of whose superior excellence we can now form no adequate ideawhen in presence of all mankind of those holy angels and of the great judge himself you must give an account of your past life and hear your final doom from which there can be no appeal and which must determine your fate to all eternity then thinkif for a moment you can bear the thoughtwhat will be the desolation shame and anguish of those wretched souls who shall hear these dreadful wordsdepart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels oh my beloved child i cannot support even the idea of your becoming one of those undone lost creatures i trust in gods mercy that you will make a better use of that knowledge of his will which he has vouchsafed you and of those amiable dispositions he has given you let us therefore turn from this horrid this insupportable view and rather endeavour to imagine as far as is possible what will be the sensation of your soul if you shall hear our heavenly judge address you in these transporting wordscome thou blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world think what it must be to become an object of the esteem and applause not only of all mankind assembled together but of all the host of heaven of our blessed lord himself nay of his and our almighty father to find your frail flesh changed in a moment into a glorious celestial body endowed with perfect beauty health and agilityto find your soul cleansed from all its faults and infirmities exalted to the purest and noblest affections overflowing with divine love and rapturous gratitudeto have your understanding enlightened and refined your heart enlarged and purified and every power and disposition of mind and body adapted to the highest relish of virtue and happiness thus accomplished to be admitted into the society of amiable and happy beings all united in the most perfect peace and friendship all breathing nothing but love to god and to each otherwith them to dwell in scenes more delightful than the richest imagination can paintfree from every pain and care and from all possibility of change or satietybut above all to enjoy the more immediate presence of god himselfto be able to comprehend and admire his adorable perfections in a high degree though still far short of their infinityto be conscious of his love and favour and to rejoice in the light of his countenancebut here all imagination failswe can form no idea of that bliss which may be communicated to us by such a near approach to the source of all beauty and all goodwe must content ourselves with believing that it is what mortal eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive the crown of all our joys will be to know that we are secure of possessing them for everwhat a transporting idea  my dearest child can you reflect on all these things and not feel the most earnest longings after immortality do not all other views and desires seem mean and trifling when compared with this and does not your inmost heart resolve that this shall be the chief and constant object of its wishes and pursuit through the whole course of your life if you are not insensible to that desire of happiness which seems woven into our nature you cannot surely be unmoved by the prospect of such a transcendent degree of it and that continued to all eternityperhaps continually increasing you cannot but dread the forfeiture of such an inheritance as the most insupportable evil remember thenremember the conditions on which alone it can be obtained god will not give to vice to carelessness or sloth the prize he has proposed to virtue you have every help that can animate your endeavoursyou have written laws to direct youthe example of christ and his disciples to encourage youthe most awakening motives to engage youand you have besides the comfortable promise of constant assistance from the holy spirit if you diligently and sincerely pray for it o my dear child let not all this mercy be lost upon you but give your attention to this your only important concern and accept with profound gratitude the inestimable advantages that are thus affectionately offered you  though the four gospels are each of them a narration of the life sayings and death of christ yet as they are not exactly alike but some circumstances and sayings omitted in one are recorded in another you must make yourself perfectly mistress of them all  the acts of the holy apostles endowed with the holy ghost and authorized by their divine master come next in order to be read nothing can be more interesting and edifying than the history of their actionsof the piety zeal and courage with which they preached the glad tidings of salvationand of the various exertions of the wonderful powers conferred on them by the holy spirit for the confirmation of their mission  the character of st paul and his miraculous conversion demand your particular attention most of the apostles were men of low birth and education but st paul was a roman citizen that is he possessed the privileges annexed to the freedom of the city of rome which was considered as an high distinction in those countries that had been conquered by the romans he was educated amongst the most learned sect of the jews and by one of their principal doctors he was a man of extraordinary eloquence as appears not only in his writings but in several speeches in his own defence pronounced before governors and courts of justice when he was called to account for the doctrines he taught he seems to have been of an uncommon warm temper and zealous in whatever religion he professed this zeal before his conversion showed itself in the most unjustifiable actions by furiously persecuting the innocent christians but though his actions were bad we may be sure his intentions were good otherwise we should not have seen a miracle employed to convince him of his mistake and to bring him into the right way this example may assure us of the mercy of god towards mistaken consciences and ought to inspire us with the most enlarged charity and goodwill towards those whose erroneous principles mislead their conduct instead of resentment and hatred against their persons we ought only to feel an active wish of assisting them to find the truth since we know not whether if convinced they might not prove like st paul chosen vessels to promote the honour of god and of true religion it is not my intention now to enter with you into any of the arguments for the truth of christianity otherwise it would be impossible wholly to pass over that which arises from this remarkable conversion and which has been so admirably illustrated by a noble writer   whose tract on this subject is in every bodys hand  next follow the epistles which make a very important part of the new testament and you cannot be too much employed in reading them they contain the most excellent precepts and admonitions and are of particular use in explaining more at large several doctrines of christianity which we could not so fully comprehend without them there are indeed in the epistles of st paul many passages hard to be understood such in particular are the first eleven chapters to the romans the greater part of his epistles to the corinthians and galatians and several chapters of that to the hebrews instead of perplexing yourself with these more obscure passages of scripture i would wish you to employ your attention chiefly on those that are plain and to judge of the doctrines taught in the other parts by comparing them with what you find in these it is through the neglect of this rule that many have been led to draw the most absurd doctrines from the holy scriptures let me particularly recommend to your careful perusal the   th   th   th and   th chapters of the epistle to the romans in the   th chapter st paul has in view the difference between the jewish and gentile or heathen converts at that time the former were disposed to look with horror on the latter for their impiety in not paying the same regard to the distinctions of days and meats that they did and the latter on the contrary were inclined to look with contempt on the former for their weakness and superstition excellent is the advice which the apostle gives to both parties he exhorts the jewish converts not to judge and the gentiles not to despise remembering that the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost endeavour to conform yourself to this advice to acquire a temper of universal candour and benevolence and learn neither to despise nor condemn any persons on account of their particular modes of faith and worship remembering always that goodness is confined to no party that there are wise and worthy men among all the sects of christians and that to his own master every one must stand or fall  i will enter no further into the several points discussed by st paul in his various epistlesmost of them too intricate for your understanding at present and many of them beyond my abilities to state clearly i will only again recommend to you to read those passages frequently which with so much fervour and energy excite you to the practice of the most exalted piety and benevolence if the effusions of a heart warmed with the tenderest affection for the whole human raceif precept warning encouragement example urged by an eloquence which such affection only could inspire are capable of influencing your mind you cannot fail to find in such parts of his epistles as are adapted to your understanding the strongest persuasives to every virtue that can adorn and improve your nature  the epistle of st james is entirely practical and exceedingly fine you cannot study it too much it seems particularly designed to guard christians against misunderstanding some things in st pauls writings which have been fatally perverted to the encouragement of a dependance on faith alone without good works but the more rational commentators will tell you that by the works of the law which the apostle asserts to be incapable of justifying us he means not the works of moral righteousness but the ceremonial works of the mosaic law on which the jews laid the greatest stress as necessary to salvation but st james tells us that if any man among us seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart that mans religion is vain and that pure religion and undefiled before god the father is this to visit the fatherless and widow in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world faith in christ if it produce not these effects he declares is dead or of no power  the epistles of st peter are also full of the best instructions and admonitions concerning the relative duties of life amongst which are set forth the duties of women in general and of wives in particular some part of the second epistle is prophetical warning the church of false teachers and false doctrines which would undermine morality and disgrace the cause of christianity  the first of st john is written in a highly figurative style which makes it in some parts hard to be understood but the spirit of divine love which it so fervently expresses renders it highly edifying and delightfulthat love of god and of man which this beloved apostle so pathetically recommends is in truth the essence of religion as our saviour himself informs us  the book of revelations contains a prophetical account of most of the great events relating to the christian church which were to happen from the time of the writer st john to the end of the world many learned men have taken a great deal of pains to explain it and they have done this in many instances very successfully but i think it is yet too soon for you to study this part of scripture some years hence perhaps there may be no objection to your attempting it and taking into your hands the best expositions to assist you in reading such of the most difficult parts of the new testament as you cannot now be supposed to understand may heaven direct you in studying this sacred volume and render it the means of making you wise unto salvation may you love and reverence as it deserves this blessed and invaluable book which contains the best rule of life the clearest declaration of the will and laws of the deity the reviving assurance of favour to true penitents and the unspeakably joyful tidings of eternal life and happiness to all the truly virtuous through jesus christ the saviour and deliverer of the world      adieu  footnote     lord lyttelton     letter iv  on the regulation of the heart and affections   you will have read the new testament to very little purpose my dearest niece if you do not perceive the great end and intention of all its precepts to be the improvement and regulation of the heart not the outward actions alone but the inward affections which give birth to them are the subjects of those precepts as appears in our saviours explanation 0 of the commandments delivered to moses and in a thousand other passages of the gospels which it is needless to recite there are no virtues more insisted on as necessary to our future happiness than humility and sincerity or uprightness of heart yet none more difficult and rare pride and vanity the vices opposite to humility are the sources of almost all the worst faults both of men and women the latter are particularly accusedand not without reasonof vanity the vice of little minds chiefly conversant with trifling subjects pride and vanity have been supposed to differ so essentially as hardly ever to be found in the same person too proud to be vain is no uncommon expression by which i suppose is meant too proud to be over anxious for the admiration of others but this seems to be founded on mistake pride is i think an high opinion of ones self and an affected contempt of others i say affected for that it is not a real contempt is evident from this that the lowest object of it is important enough to torture the proud mans heart only by refusing him the homage and admiration he requires thus haman could relish none of the advantages in which he valued himself whilst that mordecai whom he pretended to despise sat still in the kings gate and would not bow to him as he passed but as the proud mans contempt of others is only assumed with a view to awe them into reverence by his pretended superiority so it does not preclude an extreme inward anxiety about their opinions and a slavish dependance on them for all his gratifications pride though a distinct passion is seldom unaccompanied by vanity which is an extravagant desire of admiration indeed i never saw an insolent person in whom a discerning eye might not discover a very large share of vanity and of envy its usual companion one may nevertheless see many vain persons who are not proud though they desire to be admired they do not always admire themselves but as timid minds are apt to despair of those things they earnestly wish for so you will often see the woman who is most anxious to be thought handsome most inclined to be dissatisfied with her looks and to think all the assistance of art too little to attain the end desired to this cause i believe we may generally attribute affectation which seems to imply a mean opinion of ones own real form or character while we strive against nature to alter ourselves by ridiculous contortions of body or by feigned sentiments and unnatural manners there is no art so mean which this mean passion will not descend to for its gratificationno creature so insignificant whose incense it will not gladly receive far from despising others the vain man will court them with the most assiduous adulation in hopes by feeding their vanity to induce them to supply the craving wants of his own he will put on the guise of benevolence tenderness and friendship where he feels not the least degree of kindness in order to prevail on goodnature and gratitude to like and to commend him but if in any particular case he fancies the airs of insolence and contempt may succeed better he makes no scruple to assume them though so awkwardly that he still appears to depend on the breath of the person he would be thought to despise weak and timid natures seldom venture to try this last method and when they do it is without the assurance necessary to carry it on with success but a bold and confident mind will oftener endeavour to command and extort admiration than to court it as women are more fearful than men perhaps this may be one reason why they are more vain than proud whilst the other sex are oftener proud than vain it is i suppose from some opinion of a certain greatness of mind accompanying the one vice rather than the other that many will readily confess their pride nay and even be proud of their pride whilst every creature is ashamed of being convicted of vanity you see however that the end of both is the same though pursued by different means or if it differs it is in the importance of the subject whilst men are proud of power of wealth dignity learning or abilities young women are usually ambitious of nothing more than to be admired for their persons their dress or their most trivial accomplishments the homage of men is their grand object but they only desire them to be in love with their persons careless how despicable their minds appear even to these their pretended adorers i have known a woman so vain as to boast of the most disgraceful addresses being contented to be thought meanly of in points the most interesting to her honour for the sake of having it known that her person was attractive enough to make a man transgress the bounds of respect due to her character which was not a vicious one if you except this intemperate vanity but this passion too often leads to the most ruinous actions always corrupts the heart and when indulged renders it perhaps as displeasing in the sight of the almighty as those faults which find least mercy from the world yet alas it is a passion so prevailing i had almost said universal in our sex that it requires all the efforts of reason and all the assistance of grace totally to subdue it religion is indeed the only effectual remedy for this evil if our hearts are not dedicated to god they will in some way or other be dedicated to the world both in youth and age if our actions are not constantly referred to him if his approbation and favour is not our principal object we shall certainly take up with the applause of men and make that the ruling motive of our conduct how melancholy is it to see this phantom so eagerly followed through life whilst all that is truly valuable to us is looked upon with indifference or at best made subordinate to this darling pursuit  equally vain and absurd is every scheme of life that is not subservient to and does not terminate in that great end of our beingthe attainment of real excellence and of the favour of god whenever this becomes sincerely our object then will pride and vanity envy ambition covetousness and every evil passion lose their power over us and we shall in the language of scripture walk humbly with our god we shall then cease to repine under our natural or accidental disadvantages and feel dissatisfied only with our moral defectswe shall love and respect all our fellowcreatures as the children of the same dear parent and particularly those who seek to do his will all our delight will be in the saints that are in the earth and in such as excel in virtue we shall wish to cultivate goodwill and to promote innocent enjoyment wherever we arewe shall strive to please not from vanity but from benevolence instead of contemplating our own fancied perfections or even real superiority with selfcomplacence religion will teach us to look into ourselves and fear the best of us god knows have enough to fear if we honestly search into all the dark recesses of the heart and bring out every thought and intention fairly to the light to be tried by the precepts of our pure and holy religion  it is with the rules of the gospel we must compare ourselves and not with the world around us for we know that the many are wicked and that we must not be conformed to the world  how necessary it is frequently thus to enter into ourselves and search out our spirit will appear if we consider how much the human heart is prone to insincerity and how often from being first led by vanity into attempts to impose upon others we come at last to impose on ourselves  there is nothing more common than to see people fall into the most ridiculous mistakes with regard to their own characters but i can by no means allow such mistakes to be unavoidable and therefore innocent they arose from voluntary insincerity and are continued for want of that strict honesty towards ourselves and others which the scripture calls singleness of heart and which in modern language is termed simplicitythe most enchanting of all qualities esteemed and beloved in proportion to its rareness  he who requires truth in the inward parts will not excuse our selfdeception for he has commanded us to examine ourselves diligently and has given us such rules as can never mislead us if we desire the truth and are willing to see our faults in order to correct them but this is the point in which we are defective we are desirous to gain our own approbation as well as that of others at a cheaper rate than that of being really what we ought to be and we take pains to persuade ourselves that we are that which we indolently admire and approve  there is nothing in which this selfdeception is more notorious than in what regards sentiment and feeling let a vain young woman be told that tenderness and softness is the peculiar charm of the sex that even their weakness is lovely and their fears becoming and you will presently observe her grow so tender as to be ready to weep for a fly so fearful that she starts at a feather and so weakhearted that the smallest accident quite overpowers her her fondness and affection become fulsome and ridiculous her compassion grows contemptible weakness and her apprehensiveness the most abject cowardice for when once she quits the direction of nature she knows not where to stop and continually exposes herself by the most absurd extremes  nothing so effectually defeats its own ends as this kind of affectation for though warm affections and tender feelings are beyond measure amiable and charming when perfectly natural and kept under the due control of reason and principle yet nothing is so truly disgusting as the affectation of them or even the unbridled indulgence of such as are real  remember my dear that our feelings were not given us for our ornament but to spur us on to right actions compassion for instance was not impressed upon the human heart only to adorn the fair face with tears and to give an agreeable languor to the eyes it was designed to excite our utmost endeavours to relieve the sufferer yet how often have i heard that selfish weakness which flies from the sight of distress dignified with the name of tendernessmy friend is i hear in the deepest affliction and miseryi have not seen herfor indeed i cannot bear such scenesthey affect me too muchthose who have less sensibility are fitter for this worldbut for my part i own i am not able to support such thingsi shall not attempt to visit her till i hear she has recovered her spirits this have i heard said with an air of complacence and the poor selfish creature has persuaded herself that she had finer feelings than those generous friends who are sitting patiently in the house of mourning watching in silence the proper moment to pour in the balm of comfortwho suppressed their own sensations and only attended to those of the afflicted person and whose tears flowed in secret whilst their eyes and voice were taught to enliven the sinking heart with the appearance of cheerfulness  that sort of tenderness which makes us useless may indeed be pitied and excused if owing to natural imbecility but if it pretends to loveliness and excellence it becomes truly contemptible  the same degree of active courage is not to be expected in woman as in man and not belonging to her nature it is not agreeable in her but passive couragepatience and fortitude under sufferingspresence of mind and calm resignation in dangerare surely desirable in every rational creature especially in one professing to believe in an overruling providence in which we may at all times quietly confide and which we may safely trust with every event that does not depend upon our own will whenever you find yourself deficient in these virtues let it be a subject of shame and humiliationnot of vanity and selfcomplacence do not fancy yourself the more amiable for that which really makes you despicable but content yourself with the faults and weaknesses that belong to you without putting on more by way of ornament with regard to tenderness remember that compassion is best shown by an ardour to relieve and affection by assiduity to promote the good and happiness of the persons you love that tears are unamiable instead of being ornamental when voluntarily indulged and can never be attractive but when they flow irresistibly and avoid observation as much as possible the same may be said of every other mark of passion it attracts our sympathy if involuntary and not designed for our noticeit offends if we see that it is purposely indulged and obtruded on our observation  another point on which the heart is apt to deceive itself is generosity we cannot bear to suspect ourselves of base and ungenerous feelings therefore we let them work without attending to them or we endeavour to find out some better motive for those actions which really flow from envy and malignity before you flatter yourself that you are a generous benevolent person take care to examine whether you are really glad of every advantage and excellence which your friends and companions possess though they are such as you are yourself deficient in if your sister or friend makes a greater proficiency than yourself in any accomplishment which you are in pursuit of do you never wish to stop her progress instead of trying to hasten your own  the boundaries between virtuous emulation and vicious envy are very nice and may be easily mistaken the first will awaken your attention to your own defects and excite your endeavours to improve the last will make you repine at the improvements of others and wish to rob them of the praise they have deserved do you sincerely rejoice when your sister is enjoying pleasure or commendation though you are at the same time in disagreeable or mortifying circumstances do you delight to see her approved and beloved even by those who do not pay you equal attention are you afflicted and humbled when she is found to be in fault though you yourself are remarkably clear from the same offence if your heart assures you of the affirmative to these questions then may you think yourself a kind sister and a generous friend for you must observe my dear that scarcely any creature is so depraved as not to be capable of kind affections in some circumstances we are all naturally benevolent when no selfish interest interferes and where no advantage is to be given up we can all pity distress when it lies complaining at our feet and confesses our superiority and happier situation but i have seen the sufferer himself become the object of envy and illwill as soon as his fortitude and greatness of mind had begun to attract admiration and to make the envious person feel the superiority of virtue above good fortune  to take sincere pleasure in the blessings and excellencies of others is a much surer mark of benevolence than to pity their calamities and you must always acknowledge yourself ungenerous and selfish whenever you are less ready to rejoice with them that do rejoice than to weep with them that weep if ever your commendations of others are forced from you by the fear of betraying your envyor if ever you feel a secret desire to mention something that may abate the admiration given them do not try to conceal the base disposition from yourself since that is not the way to cure it  human nature is ever liable to corruption and has in it the seeds of every vice as well as of every virtue and the first will be continually shooting forth and growing up if not carefully watched and rooted out as fast as they appear it is the business of religion to purify and exalt us from a state of imperfection and infirmity to that which is necessary and essential to happiness envy would make us miserable in heaven itself could it be admitted there for we must there see beings far more excellent and consequently more happy than ourselves and till we can rejoice in seeing virtue rewarded in proportion to its degree we can never hope to be among the number of the blessed  watch then my dear child and observe every evil propensity of your heart that you may in time correct it with the assistance of that grace which alone can conquer the evils of our nature and which you must constantly and earnestly implore  i must add that even those vices which you would most blush to own and which most effectually defile and vilify the female heart may by degrees be introduced into yoursto the ruin of that virtue without which misery and shame must be your portionunless the avenues of the heart are guarded by a sincere abhorrence of every thing that approaches towards evil would you be of the number of those blessed who are pure in heart you must hate and avoid every thing both in books and in conversation that conveys impure ideas however neatly clothed in decent language or recommended to your taste by pretended refinements and tender sentimentsby elegance of style or force of wit and genius  i must not now begin to give you my thoughts on the regulation of the affections as that is a subject of too much consequence to be soon dismissed i shall dedicate to it my next letter in the mean time believe me      your ever affectionate  footnote   0 matt v     letter v  on the regulation of the affections   the attachments of the heart on which almost all the happiness or misery of life depends are most interesting objects of our consideration i shall give my dear niece the observations which experience has enabled me to draw from real life and not from what others have said or written however great their authority  the first attachment of young hearts is friendshipthe noblest and happiest of affections when real and built on a solid foundation but oftener pernicious than useful to very young people because the connection itself is ill understood and the subject of it frequently ill chosen their first error is that of supposing equality of age and exact similarity of disposition indispensably requisite in friends whereas these are circumstances which in great measure disqualify them for assisting each other in moral improvements or supplying each others defects they expose them to the same dangers and incline them to encourage rather than correct each others failings  the grand cement of this kind of friendship is telling secrets which they call confidence and i verily believe that the desire of having secrets to tell has often helped to draw silly girls into very unhappy adventures if they have no lover or amour to talk of the too frequent subject of their confidence is betraying the secrets of their families or conjuring up fancied hardships to complain of against their parents or relations this odious cabal they call friendship and fancy themselves dignified by the profession but nothing is more different from the reality as is seen by observing how generally those early friendships drop off as the parties advance in years and understanding  do not you my dear be too ready to profess a friendship with any of your young companions love them and be always ready to serve and oblige them and to promote all their innocent gratifications but be very careful how you enter into confidence with girls of your own age rather choose some person of riper years and judgment whose goodnature and worthy principles may assure you of her readiness to do you a service and of her candour and condescension towards you  i do not expect that youth should delight to associate with age or should lay open its feelings and inclinations to such as have almost forgot what they were or how to make proper allowance for them but if you are fortunate enough to meet with a young woman eight or ten years older than yourself of good sense and good principles to whom you can make yourself agreeable it may be one of the happiest circumstances of your life she will be able to advise and to improve youand your desire of this assistance will recommend you to her taste as much as her superior abilities will recommend her to you such a connection will afford you more pleasure as well as more profit than you can expect from a girl like yourself equally unprovided with knowledge prudence or any of those qualifications which are necessary to make society delightful  with a friend such as i have described of twentythree or twentyfour years of age you can hardly pass an hour without finding yourself brought forward in some useful knowledge without learning something of the world or of your own nature some rule of behaviour or some necessary caution in the conduct of life for even in the gayest conversations such useful hints may often be gathered from those whose knowledge and experience are much beyond our own whenever you find yourself in real want of advice or seek the relief of unburdening your heart such a friend will be able to judge of the feelings you describe or of the circumstances you are inperhaps from her own experienceor at least from the knowledge she will have gained of human nature she will be able to point out your dangers and to guide you into the right path or if she finds herself incapable she will have the prudence to direct you to some abler adviser the age i have mentioned will not prevent her joining in your pleasures nor will it make her a dull or grave companion on the contrary she will have more materials for entertaining conversation and her liveliness will shew itself more agreeably than in one of your own age yours therefore will be the advantage in such a connection yet do not despair of being admitted into it if you have an amiable and docile disposition ingenuous youth has many charms for a benevolent mind and as nothing is more endearing than the exercise of benevolence the hope of being useful and beneficial to you will make her fond of your company  i have known some of the sweetest and most delightful connections between persons of different ages in which the elder has received the highest gratification from the affection and docility of the younger whilst the latter has gained the noblest advantages from the conversation and counsels of her wiser friend nor has the attachment been without use as well as pleasure to the elder party she has found that there is no better way of improving ones own attainments than by imparting them to another and the desire of doing this in the most acceptable way has added a sweetness and gentleness to her manner and taught her the arts of insinuating instruction and of winning the heart whilst she convinces the understanding  i hope my dear you in your turn will be this useful and engaging friend to your younger companions particularly to your sisters and brothers who ought everunless they should prove unworthyto be your nearest and dearest friends whose interest and welfare you are bound to desire as much as your own if you are wanting here do not fancy yourself qualified for friendship with others but be assured your heart is too narrow and selfish for so generous an affection  remember that the end of true friendship is the good of its object and the cultivation of virtue in two hearts emulous of each other and desirous to perpetuate their society beyond the grave nothing can be more contrary to this end than that mutual intercourse of flattery which some call friendship a real friend will venture to displease me rather than indulge my faulty inclinations or increase my natural frailties she will endeavour to make me acquainted with myself and will put me upon guarding the weak parts of my character  friendship in the highest sense of the word can only subsist between persons of strict integrity and true generosity before you fancy yourself possessed of such a treasure you should examine the value of your own heart and see how well it is qualified for so sacred a connection and then a harder task remainsto find out whether the object of your affection is also endued with the same virtuous disposition youth and inexperience are ill able to penetrate into characters the least appearance of good attracts their admiration and they immediately suppose they have found the object they pursued  it is a melancholy consideration that the judgement can only be formed by experience which generally comes too late for our own use and is seldom accepted for that of others i fear it is in vain for me to tell you what dangerous mistakes i made in the early choice of friendshow incapable i then was of finding out such as were fit for me and how little i was acquainted with the true nature of friendship when i thought myself most fervently engaged in it i am sensible all this will hardly persuade you to choose by the eyes of others or even to suspect that your own may be deceived yet if you should give any weight to my observations it may not be quite useless to mention to you some of the essential requisites in a friend and to exhort you never to choose one in whom they are wanting  the first of these is a deep and sincere regard for religion if your friend draws her principles from the same source with yourself if the gospel precepts are the rule of her life as well as yours you will always know what to expect from her and have one common standard of right and wrong to refer to by which to regulate all material points of conduct the woman who thinks lightly of sacred things or who is ever heard to speak of them with levity or indifference cannot reasonably be expected to pay a more serious regard to the laws of friendship or to be uniformly punctual in the performance of any of the duties of society take no such person to your bosom however recommended by goodhumour wit or any other qualification nor let gaiety or thoughtlessness be deemed an excuse for offending in this important point a person habituated to the love and reverence of religion and virtue no more wants the guard of serious consideration to restrain her from speaking disrespectfully of them than to prevent her speaking ill of her dearest friend in the liveliest hour of mirth the innocent heart can dictate nothing but what is innocent it will immediately take alarm at the apprehension of doing wrong and stop at once in the full career of youthful sprightliness if reminded of the neglect or transgression of any duty watch for these symptoms of innocence and goodness and admit no one to your entire affection who would ever persuade you to make light of any sort of offence or who can treat with levity or contempt any person or thing that bears a relation to religion  a due regard to reputation is the next indispensable qualificationhave regard to thy name saith the wise son of sirach for that will continue with thee above a thousand great treasures of gold the young person who is careless of blame and indifferent to the esteem of the wise and prudent part of the world is not only a most dangerous companion but gives a certain proof of the want of rectitude in her own mind discretion is the guardian of all the virtues and when she forsakes them they cannot long resist the attacks of an enemy there is a profligacy of spirit in defying the rules of decorum and despising censure which seldom ends otherwise than in extreme corruption and utter ruin modesty and prudence are qualities that early display themselves and are easily discerned where these do not appear you should avoid not only friendship but every step towards intimacy lest your own character should suffer with that of your companion but where they shine forth in any eminent degree you may safely cultivate an acquaintance in the reasonable hope of finding the solid fruits of virtue beneath such sweet and promising blossoms should you be disappointed you will at least have run no risk in the search after them and may cherish as a creditable acquaintance the person so adorned though she may not deserve a place in your inmost heart  the understanding must next be examined and this is a point which requires so much understanding to judge of in another that i must earnestly recommend to you not to rely entirely on your own but to take the opinion of your older friends i do not wish you to seek for bright and uncommon talents though these are sources of inexhaustible delight and improvement when found in company with solid judgment and sound principles good sense by which i mean a capacity for reasoning justly and discerning truly applied to the uses of life and exercised in distinguishing characters and directing conduct is alone necessary to an intimate connection but without this the best intentions though certain of reward hereafter may fail of producing their effects in this life nor can they singly constitute the character of an useful and valuable friend on the other hand the most dazzling genius or the most engaging wit and humour can but ill answer the purposes of friendship without plain common sense and a faculty of just reasoning  what can one do with those who will not be answered with reason and who when you are endeavouring to convince or persuade them by serious arguments will parry the blow with a witty repartee or a stroke of poignant raillery i know not whether such a reply is less provoking than that of an obstinate fool who answers your strongest reasons withwhat you say may be very true but this is my way of thinking a small acquaintance with the world will show you instances of the most absurd and foolish conduct in persons of brilliant parts and entertaining faculties but how trifling is the talent of diverting an idle hour compared with true wisdom and prudence which are perpetually wanted to direct us safely and happily through life and to make us useful and valuable to others  fancy i know will have her share in friendship as well as in loveyou must please as well as serve me before i can love you as the friend of my heart but the faculties that please for an evening may not please for life the humourous man soon runs through his stock of odd stories mimickry and jest and the wit by constant repeated flashes confounds and tires ones intellect instead of enlivening it with agreeable surprise but good sense can neither tire nor wear out it improves by exercise and increases in value the more it is known the pleasure it gives in conversation is lasting and satisfactory because it is accompanied with improvement its worth is proportioned to the occasion that calls for it and rises highest on the most interesting topics the heart as well as the understanding finds its account in it and our noblest interests are promoted by the entertainment we receive from such a companion  a good temper is the next qualification the value of which in a friend you will want no arguments to prove when you are truly convinced of the necessity of it in yourself which i shall endeavour to show you in a following letter but as this is a quality in which you may be deceived without a long and intimate acquaintance you must not be hasty in forming connections before you have had sufficient opportunity for making observations on this head a young person when pleased and enlivened by the presence of her youthful companions seldom shows ill temper which must be extreme indeed if it is not at least controllable in such situations but you must watch her behaviour to her own family and the degree of estimation she stands in with them observe her manner to servants and inferiorsto childrenand even to animals see in what manner she bears disappointments contradiction and restraint and what degree of vexation she expresses on any accident of loss or trouble if in such little trials she shows a meek resigned and cheerful temper she will probably preserve it on greater occasions but if she is impatient and discontented under these how will she support the far greater evils which may await her in her progress through life if you should have an opportunity of seeing her in sickness observe whether her complaints are of a mild and gentle kind forced from her by pain and restrained as much as possible or whether they are expressions of a turbulent rebellious mind that hardly submits to the divine hand see whether she is tractable considerate kind and grateful to those about her or whether she takes the opportunity which their compassion gives her to tyrannize over and torment them women are in general very liable to ill health which must necessarily make them in some measure troublesome and disagreeable to those they live with they should therefore take the more pains to lighten the burden as much as possible by patience and good humour and be careful not to let their infirmities break in on the health freedom or enjoyments of others more than is needful and just some ladies seem to think it very improper for any person within their reach to enjoy a moments comfort while they are in pain and make no scruple of sacrificing to their own least convenience whenever they are indisposed the proper rest meals or refreshments of their servants and even sometimes of their husbands and children but their selfishness defeats its own purpose as it weakens that affection and tender pity which excites the most assiduous services and affords the most healing balm to the heart of the sufferer  i have already expressed my wishes that your chosen friend may be some years older than yourself but this is an advantage not always to be obtained whatever be her age religion discretion good sense and good temper must on no account be dispensed with and till you can find one so qualified you had better make no closer connection than that of a mutual intercourse of civilities and good offices but if it is always your aim to mix with the best company and to be worthy of such society you will probably meet with some one among them deserving your affection to whom you may be equally agreeable  when i speak of the best company i do not mean in the common acceptation of the word persons of high rank and fortunebut rather the most worthy and sensible it is however very important to a young woman to be introduced into life on a respectable footing and to converse with those whose manners and style of life may polish her behaviour refine her sentiments and give her consequence in the eye of the world your equals in rank are most proper for intimacy but to be sometimes amongst your superiors is every way desirable and advantageous unless it should inspire you with pride or with the foolish desire of emulating their grandeur and expense  above all things avoid intimacy with those of low birth and education nor think it a mark of humility to delight in such society for it much oftener proceeds from the meanest kind of pridethat of being the head of the company and seeing your companions subservient to you the servile flattery and submission which usually recommend such people and make amends for their ignorance and want of conversation will infallibly corrupt your heart and make all company insipid from whom you cannot expect the same homage your manners and faculties instead of improving must be continually lowered to suit you to your companions and believe me you will find it no easy matter to raise them again to a level with those of polite and wellinformed people  the greatest kindness and civility to inferiors is perfectly consistent with proper caution on this head treat them always with affability and talk to them of their own affairs with an affectionate interest but never make them familiar nor admit them as associates in your diversions but above all never trust them with your secrets which is putting yourself entirely in their power and subjecting yourself to the most shameful slavery the only reason for making choice of such confidants must be the certainty that they will not venture to blame or contradict inclinations which you are conscious no true friend would encourage but this is a meanness into which i trust you are in no danger of falling i rather hope you will have the laudable ambition of spending your time chiefly with those whose superior talents education and politeness may continually improve you and whose society will do you honour however let no advantage of this kind weigh against the want of principle i have long ago resolved with david that as far as lies in my power i will not know a wicked person nothing can compensate for the contagion of bad example and for the danger of wearing off by use that abhorrence of evil actions and sentiments which every innocent mind sets out with but which an indiscriminate acquaintance in the world soon abates and at length destroys  if you are good and seek friendship only among the good i trust you will be happy enough to find it the wise son of sirach pronounces that you will   a faithful friend saith he is the medicine of life and he that feareth the lord shall find him whoso feareth the lord shall direct his friendship aright for as he is so shall his neighbour be also in the same admirable book you will find directions how to choose and preserve a friend indeed there is hardly a circumstance in life concerning which you may not there meet with the best advice imaginable caution in making friendships is particularly recommended   be in peace with many nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand if thou wouldst get a friend prove him first and be not hasty to credit him for some man is a friend for his own occasion and will not abide in the day of trouble and there is a friend who being turned to enmity and strife will discover thy reproach again some friend is a companion at the table and will not continue in the day of thy affliction but in thy prosperity he will be as thyself and will be bold over thy servants if thou be brought low he will be against thee and will hide himself from thy face chap ix  0 forsake not an old friend for the new is not comparable to hima new friend is as new wine when it is old thou shalt drink it with pleasure  when you have discreetly chosen the next point is how to preserve your friend numbers complain of the fickleness and ingratitude of those on whom they bestowed their affection but few examine whether what they complain of is not owing to themselves affection is not like a portion of freehold land which once settled upon you is a possession for ever without further trouble on your part if you grow less deserving or less attentive to please you must expect to see the effects of your remissness in the gradual decline of your friends esteem and attachment resentment and reproaches will not recal what you have lost but on the contrary will hasten the dissolution of every remaining tie the best remedy is to renew your care and assiduity to deserve and cultivate affection without seeming to have perceived its abatement jealousy and distrust are the bane of friendship whose essence is esteem and affiance but if jealousy is expressed by unkind upbraidings or what is worse by cold haughty looks and insolent contempt it can hardly fail if often repeated to realize the misfortune which at first perhaps was imaginary nothing can be more an antidote to affection than such behaviour or than the cause of it which in reality is nothing but pride though the jealous person would fain attribute it to uncommon tenderness and delicacy but tenderness is never so expressed it is indeed deeply sensible of unkindness but it cannot be unkindit may subsist with anger but not with contemptit may be weakened or even killed by ingratitude but it cannot be changed into hatred remember always that if you would be loved you must be amiable habit may indeed for a time supply the deficiency of merit what we have long loved we do not easily cease to love but habit will at length be conquered by frequent disgusts  whoso casteth a stone at the birds frayeth them away and he that upbraideth his friend breaketh friendship though thou drewest a sword at thy friend yet despair not for there may be a returning to favour if thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend fear not for there may be a reconciliation excepting for upbraiding or pride or disclosing of secrets or a treacherous woundfor for these things every friend will depart  i have hitherto spoken of a friend in the singular number rather in compliance with the notions of most writers who have treated of friendship and who generally suppose it can have but one object than from my own ideas the highest kind of friendship is indeed confined to onei mean the conjugal which in its perfection is so entire and absolute an union of interest will and affection as no other connection can stand in competition with but there are various degrees of friendship which can admit of several objects esteemed and delighted in for different qualities and whose separate rights are perfectly compatible perhaps it is not possible to love two persons exactly in the same degree yet the difference may be so small that none of the parties can be certain on which side the scale preponderates  it is narrowness of mind to wish to confine your friends affection solely to yourself since you are conscious that however perfect your attachment may be you cannot possibly supply to her all the blessings she may derive from several friends who may each love her as well as you do and may each contribute largely to her happiness if she depends on you alone for all the comforts and advantages of friendship your absence or death may leave her desolate and forlorn if therefore you prefer her good to your own selfish gratification you should rather strive to multiply her friends and be ready to embrace in your affections all who love and deserve her love this generosity will bring its own reward by multiplying the sources of your pleasures and supports and your first friend will love you the more for such an endearing proof of the extent of your affection which can stretch to receive all who are dear to her but if on the contrary every mark of esteem shewn to another excites uneasiness or resentment in you the person you love must soon feel her connection with you a burden and restraint she can own no obligation to so selfish an attachment nor can her tenderness be increased by that which lessens her esteem if she is really fickle and ungrateful she is not worth your reproaches if not she must be reasonably offended by such injurious imputations  you do not want to be told that the strictest fidelity is required in friendship and though possibly instances might be brought in which even the secret of a friend must be sacrificed to the calls of justice and duty yet these are rare and doubtful cases and we may venture to pronounce that   whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit and shall never find a friend to his mindlove thy friend and be faithful unto him but if thou betrayest his secrets follow no more after him for as a man that hath destroyed his enemy so hast thou destroyed the love of thy friend as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand so hast thou let thy neighbour go follow no more after him for he is too far off he is as a roe escaped out of the snare as for a wound it may be bound up and after revilings there may be reconcilement but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope  but in order to reconcile this inviolable fidelity with the duty you owe to yourself or others you must carefully guard against being made the repository of such secrets as are not fit to be kept if your friend should engage in any unlawful pursuitif for instance she should intend to carry on an affair of love unknown to her parentsyou must first use your utmost endeavours to dissuade her from it and if she persists positively and solemnly declare against being a confidant in such a case suffer her not to speak to you on the subject and warn her to forbear acquainting you with any step she may propose to take towards a marriage unsanctified by parental approbation tell her you would think it your duty to apprize her parents of the danger into which she was throwing herself however unkindly she may take this at the time she will certainly esteem and love you the more for it whenever she recovers a sense of her duty or experiences the sad effects of swerving from it  there is another case which i should not choose to suppose possible in addressing myself to so young a person was it not that too many instances of it have of late been exposed to public animadversion i mean the case of a married woman who encourages or tolerates the addresses of a lover may no such person be ever called a friend of yours but if ever one whom when innocent you had loved should fall into so fatal an error i can only say that after proper remonstrances you must immediately withdraw from all intimacy and confidence with her nor let the absurd pretence of innocent intentions in such circumstances prevail with you to lend your countenance a moment to disgraceful conduct there cannot be innocence in any degree of indulgence to unlawful passion the sacred obligations of marriage are very ill understood by the wife who can think herself innocent while she parleys with a lover or with love and who does not shut her heart and ears against the most distant approaches of either a virtuous wifethough she should be so unhappy as not to be secured by having her strongest affections fixed on her husbandwill never admit an idea of any other man in the light of a lover but if such an idea should unawares intrude into her mind she would instantly stifle it before it grew strong enough to give her much uneasiness not to the most intimate friendhardly to her own soulwould she venture to confess a weakness she would so sincerely abhor whenever therefore such infidelity of heart is made a subject of confidence depend upon it the corruption has spread far and has been faultily indulged enter not into her counsels show her the danger she is in and then withdraw yourself from it whilst you are yet unsullied by contagion  it has been supposed a duty of friendship to lay open every thought and every feeling of the heart to our friend but i have just mentioned a case in which this is not only unnecessary but wrong a disgraceful inclination which we resolve to conquer should be concealed from every body and is more easily subdued when denied the indulgence of talking of its object and i think there may be other instances in which it would be most prudent to keep our thoughts concealed even from our dearest friend some things i would communicate to one friend and not to another whom perhaps i loved better because i might know that my first friend was not so well qualified as the other to counsel me on that particular subject a natural bias on her mind some prevailing opinion or some connection with persons concerned might make her an improper confidant with regard to one particular though qualified to be so on all other occasions  this confidence of friendship is indeed one of its sweetest pleasures and greatest advantages the human heart often stands in need of some kind and faithful partner of its cares in whom it may repose all its weaknesses and with whom it is sure of finding the tenderest sympathy far be it from me to shut up the heart with cold distrust and rigid caution or to adopt the odious maxim that we should live with a friend as if he were one day to become an enemy but we must not wholly abandon prudence in any sort of connection since when every guard is laid aside our unbounded openness may injure others as well as ourselves secrets entrusted to us must be sacredly kept even from our nearest friend for we have no right to dispose of the secrets of others  if there is danger in making an improper choice of friends my dear child how much more fatal would it be to mistake in a stronger kind of attachmentin that which leads to an irrevocable engagement for life yet so much more is the understanding blinded when once the fancy is captivated that it seems a desperate undertaking to convince a girl in love that she has mistaken the character of the man she prefers  if the passions would wait for the decision of judgment and if a young woman could have the same opportunities of examining into the real character of her lover as into that of a female candidate for her friendship the same rules might direct you in the choice of both for marriage being the highest state of friendship the qualities requisite in a friend are still more important in a husband but young women know so little of the world especially of the other sex and such pains are usually taken to deceive them that they are every way unqualified to choose for themselves upon their own judgment many a heartache shall i feel for you my sweet girl if i live a few years longer since not only all your happiness in this world but your advancement in religion and virtue or your apostacy from every good principle you have been taught will probably depend on the companion you fix to for life happy will it be for you if you are wise and modest enough to withdraw from temptation and preserve your heart free and open to receive the just recommendation of your parents further than a recommendation i dare say they will never go in an affair which though it should be begun by them ought never to be proceeded in without your free concurrence  whatever romantic notions you may hear or read of depend upon it those matches are the happiest which are made on rational groundson suitableness of character degree and fortuneon mutual esteem and the prospect of a real and permanent friendship far be it from me to advise you to marry where you do not lovea mercenary marriage is a detestable prostitution but on the other hand an union formed upon mere personal liking without the requisite foundation of esteem without the sanction of parental approbation and consequently without the blessing of god can be productive of nothing but misery and shame the passion to which every consideration of duty and prudence is sacrificed instead of supplying the loss of all other advantages will soon itself be changed into mutual distrustrepentancereproachesand finally perhaps into hatred the distresses it brings will be void of every consolation you will have disgusted the friends who should be your supportdebased yourself in the eyes of the worldand what is much worse in your own eyes and even in those of your husband above all you will have offended that god who alone can shield you from calamity  from an act like this i trust your duty and gratitude to your kind parentsthe first of dudes next to that we owe to god and inseparably connected with itwill effectually preserve you but most young people think they have fulfilled their duty if they refrain from actually marrying against prohibition they suffer their affections and even perhaps their word of honour to be engaged without consulting their parents yet satisfy themselves with resolving not to marry without their consent not considering that besides the wretched useless uncomfortable state they plunge themselves into when they contract an hopeless engagement they must likewise involve a parent in the miserable dilemma of either giving a forced consent against his judgment or of seeing his beloved child pine away her prime of life in fruitless anxietyseeing her accuse him of tyranny because he restrains her from certain ruinseeing her affections alienated from her familyand all her thoughts engrossed by one object to the destruction of her health and spirits and of all improvements and occupations what a cruel alternative for parents whose happiness is bound up with that of their child the time to consult them is before you have given a lover the least encouragement nor ought you to listen a moment to the man who would wish you to keep his addresses secret since he thereby shows himself conscious that they are not fit to be encouraged  but perhaps i have said enough on this subject at present though if ever advice on such a topic can be of use it must be before passion has got possession of the heart and silenced both reason and principle fix therefore in your mind as deeply as possible those rules of duty and prudence which now seem reasonable to you that they may be at hand in the hour of trial and save you from the miseries in which strong affections unguided by discretion involve so many of our sex  if you love virtue sincerely you will be incapable of loving an openly vicious character but alas your innocent heart may be easily ensnared by an artful oneand from this danger nothing can secure you but the experience of those to whose guidance god has entrusted you may you be wise enough to make use of itso will you have the fairest chance of attaining the best blessings this world can afford in a faithful and virtuous union with a worthy man who may direct your steps in safety and honour through this life and partake with you the rewards of virtue in that which is to come but if this happy lot should be denied you do not be afraid of a single life a worthy woman is never destitute of valuable friends who in a great measure supply to her the want of nearer connections she can never be slighted or disesteemed while her good temper and benevolence render her a blessing to her companions nay she must be honoured by all persons of sense and virtue for preferring the single state to an union unworthy of her the calamities of an unhappy marriage are so much greater than can befall a single person that the unmarried woman may find abundant argument to be contented with her condition when pointed out to her by providence whether married or single if your first care is to please god you will undoubtedly be a blessed creaturefor that which he delights in must be happy how earnestly i wish you this happiness you can never know unless you could read the heart of      your truly affectionate  footnotes     ecclus v     ibid vi     ecclus xxii  0     ecclus xxvii        letter vi  on the government of the temper   the next great point of importance to your future happiness my dear is what your parents have doubtless been continually attentive to from your infancy as it is impossible to undertake it too earlyi mean the due regulation of your temper though you are in great measure indebted to their forming hands for whatever is good in it you are sensible no doubt as every human creature is of propensities to some infirmity of temper which it must now be your own care to correct and to subdue otherwise the pains that have hitherto been taken with you may all become fruitless and when you are your own mistress you may relapse into those faults which were originally in your nature and which will require to be diligently watched and kept under through the whole course of your life  if you consider that the constant tenor of the gospel precepts is to promote love peace and goodwill amongst men you will not doubt that the cultivation of an amiable disposition is a great part of your religious duty since nothing leads more directly to the breach of charity and to the injury and molestation of our fellowcreatures than the indulgence of an illtemper do not therefore think lightly of the offences you may commit for want of a due command over it or suppose yourself responsible for them to your fellowcreatures only but be assured you must give a strict account of them all to the supreme governor of the world who has made this a great part of your appointed trial upon earth  a woman bred up in a religious manner placed above the reach of want and out of the way of sordid or scandalous vices can have but few temptations to the flagrant breach of the divine laws it particularly concerns her therefore to understand them in their full import and to consider how far she trespasses against them by such actions as appear trivial when compared with murder adultery and theft but which become of very great importance by being frequently repeated and occurring in the daily transactions of life  the principal virtues or vices of a woman must be of a private and domestic kind within the circle of her own family and dependents lies her sphere of actionthe scene of almost all those tasks and trials which must determine her character and her fate here and hereafter reflect for a moment how much the happiness of her husband children and servants must depend on her temper and you will see that the greatest good or evil which she ever may have in her power to do may arise from her correcting or indulging its infirmities  though i wish the principle of duty towards god to be your ruling motive in the exercise of every virtue yet as human nature stands in need of all possible helps let us not forget how essential it is to present happiness and to the enjoyment of this life to cultivate such a temper as is likewise indispensably requisite to the attainment of higher felicity in the life to come the greatest outward blessings cannot afford enjoyment to a mind ruffled and uneasy within itself a fit of illhumour will spoil the finest entertainment and is as real a torment as the most painful disease another unavoidable consequence of illtemper is the dislike and aversion of all who are witnesses to it and perhaps the deep and lasting resentment of those who suffer from its effects we all from social or selflove earnestly desire the esteem and affection of our fellowcreatures and indeed our condition makes them so necessary to us that the wretch who has forfeited them must feel desolate and undone deprived of all the best enjoyments and comforts the world can afford and given up to his inward misery unpitied and scorned but this can never be the fate of a goodnatured person whatever faults he may have they will generally be treated with lenity he will find an advocate in every human heart his errors will be lamented rather than abhorred and his virtues will be viewed in the fairest point of light his good humour without the help of great talents or acquirements will make his company preferable to that of the most brilliant genius in whom this quality is wanting in short it is almost impossible that you can be sincerely beloved by any body without this engaging property whatever other excellencies you may possess but with it you will scarcely fail of finding some friends and favourers even though you should be destitute of almost every other advantage  perhaps you will say all this is very true but our tempers are not in our own power we are made with different dispositions and if mine is not amiable it is rather my unhappiness than my fault this my dear is commonly said by those who will not take the trouble to correct themselves yet be assured it is a delusion and will not avail in our justification before him who knoweth whereof we are made and of what we are capable it is true we are not all equally happy in our dispositions but human virtue consists in cherishing and cultivating every good inclination and in checking and subduing every propensity to evil if you had been born with a bad temper it might have been made a good one at least with regard to its outward effects by education reason and principle and though you are so happy as to have a good one while young do not suppose it will always continue so if you neglect to maintain a proper command over it power sickness disappointments or worldly cares may corrupt and embitter the finest disposition if they are not counteracted by reason and religion  it is observed that every temper is inclined in some degree either to passion peevishness or obstinacy many are so unfortunate as to be inclined to each of the three in turn it is necessary therefore to watch the bent of our nature and to apply the remedies proper for the infirmity to which we are most liable with regard to the first it is so injurious to society and so odious in itself especially in the female character that one would think shame alone would be sufficient to preserve a young woman from giving way to it for it is as unbecoming her character to be betrayed into illbehaviour by passion as by intoxication and she ought to be ashamed of the one as much as of the other gentleness meekness and patience are her peculiar distinctions and an enraged woman is one of the most disgusting sights in nature  it is plain from experience that the most passionate people can command themselves when they have a motive sufficiently strongsuch as the presence of those they fear or to whom they particularly desire to recommend themselves it is therefore no excuse to persons whom you have injured by unkind reproaches and unjust aspersions to tell them you was in a passion the allowing yourself to speak to them in a passion is a proof of an insolent disrespect which the meanest of your fellowcreatures would have a right to resent when once you find yourself heated so far as to desire to say what you know would be provoking and wounding to another you should immediately resolve either to be silent or to quit the room rather than give utterance to any thing dictated by so bad an inclination be assured you are then unfit to reason or to reprove or to hear reason from others it is therefore your part to retire from such an occasion of sin and wait till you are cool before you presume to judge of what has passed by accustoming yourself thus to conquer and disappoint your anger you will by degrees find it grow weak and manageable so as to leave your reason at liberty you will be able to restrain your tongue from evil and your looks and gestures from all expressions of violence and illwill pride which produces so many evils in the human mind is the great source of passion whoever cultivates in himself a proper humility a due sense of his own faults and insufficiencies and a due respect for others will find but small temptation to violent or unreasonable anger  in the case of real injuries which justify and call for resentment there is a noble and generous kind of anger a proper and necessary part of our nature which has nothing in it sinful or degrading i would not wish you insensible to this for the person who feels not an injury must be incapable of being properly affected by benefits with those who treat you ill without provocation you ought to maintain your own dignity but in order to do this whilst you show a sense of their improper behaviour you must preserve calmness and even goodbreeding and thereby convince them of the impotence as well as injustice of their malice you must also weigh every circumstance with candour and charity and consider whether your showing the resentment deserved may not produce ill consequences to innocent personsas is almost always the case in family quarrels and whether it may not occasion the breach of some duty or necessary connection to which you ought to sacrifice even your just resentments above all things take care that a particular offence to you does not make you unjust to the general character of the offending person generous anger does not preclude esteem for whatever is really estimable nor does it destroy goodwill to the person of its object it even inspires the desire of overcoming him by benefits and wishes to inflict no other punishment than the regret of having injured one who deserved his kindness it is always placable and ready to be reconciled as soon as the offender is convinced of his error nor can any subsequent injury provoke it to recur to past disobligations which had been once forgiven but it is perhaps unnecessary to give rules for this case the consciousness of injured innocence naturally produces dignity and usually prevents excess of anger our passion is most unruly when we are conscious of blame and when we apprehend that we have laid ourselves open to contempt where we know we have been wrong the least injustice in the degree of blame imputed to us excites our bitterest resentment but where we know ourselves faultless the sharpest accusation excites pity or contempt rather than rage whenever therefore you feel yourself very angry suspect yourself to be in the wrong and resolve to stand the decision of your own conscience before you cast upon another the punishment which is perhaps due to yourself this selfexamination will at least give you time to cool and if you are just will dispose you to balance your own wrong with that of your antagonist and to settle the account with him on equal terms  peevishness though not so violent and fatal in its immediate effects is still more unamiable than passion and if possible more destructive of happiness inasmuch as it operates more continually though the fretful man injures us less he disgusts us more than the passionate one because he betrays a low and little mind intent on trifles and engrossed by a paltry selflove which knows not how to bear the very apprehension of any inconvenience it is selflove then which we must combat when we find ourselves assaulted by this infirmity and by voluntarily induring inconveniences we shall habituate ourselves to bear them with ease and goodhumour when occasioned by others perhaps this is the best kind of religious mortification as the chief end of denying ourselves any innocent indulgences must be to acquire a habit of command over our passions and inclinations particularly such as are likely to lead us into evil another method of conquering this enemy is to abstract our minds from that attention to trifling circumstances which usually creates this uneasiness those who are engaged in high and important pursuits are very little affected by small inconveniences the man whose head is full of studious thought or whose heart is full of care will eat his dinner without knowing whether it was well or ill dressed or whether it was served punctually at the hour or not and though absence from the common things of life is far from desirableespecially in a womanyet too minute and anxious an attention to them seldom fails to produce a teasing mean and fretful disposition i would therefore wish your mind to have always some object in pursuit worthy of it that it may not be engrossed by such as are in themselves scarce worth a moments anxiety it is chiefly in the decline of life when amusements fail and when the more importunate passions subside that this infirmity is observed to grow upon us and perhaps it will seldom fail to do so unless carefully watched and counteracted by reason we must then endeavour to substitute some pursuits in the place of those which can only engage us in the beginning of our course the pursuit of glory and happiness in another life by every means of improving and exalting our own minds becomes more and more interesting to us the nearer we draw to the end of all sublunary enjoyments reading reflection rational conversation and above all conversing with god by prayer and meditation may preserve us from taking that anxious interest in the little comforts and conveniences of our remaining days which usually gives birth to so much fretfulness in old people but though the aged and infirm are most liable to this eviland they alone are to be pitied for ityet we sometimes see the young the healthy and those who enjoy most outward blessings inexcusably guilty of it the smallest disappointment in pleasure or difficulty in the most trifling employment will put wilful young people out of temper and their very amusements frequently become sources of vexation and peevishness how often have i seen a girl preparing for a ball or for some other public appearanceunable to satisfy her own vanityfret over every ornament she put on quarrel with her maid with her clothes her hair and growing still more unlovely as she grew more cross be ready to fight with her lookingglass for not making her as handsome as she wished to be she did not consider that the traces of this illhumour on her countenance would be a greater disadvantage to her appearance than any defect in her dress or even than the plainest features enlivened by joy and goodhumour there is a degree of resignation necessary even to the enjoyment of pleasure we must be ready and willing to give up some part of what we could wish for before we can enjoy that which is indulged to us i have no doubt that she who frets all the while she is dressing for an assembly will suffer still greater uneasiness when she is there the same craving restless vanity will there endure a thousand mortifications which in the midst of seeming pleasure will secretly corrode her heart whilst the meek and humble generally find more gratification than they expected and return home pleased and enlivened from every scene of amusement though they could have staid away from it with perfect ease and contentment  sullenness or obstinacy is perhaps a worse fault of temper than either of the former and if indulged may end in the most fatal extremes of stubborn melancholy malice and revenge the resentment which instead of being expressed is nursed in secret and continually aggravated by the imagination will in time become the ruling passion and then how horrible must be his case whose kind and pleasurable affections are all swallowed up by the tormenting as well as detestable sentiments of hatred and revenge   admonish thy friend peradventure he hath not done it or if he hath that he do it no moreadmonish thy friend peradventure he hath not said it or if he hath that he speak it not again brood not over a resentment which perhaps was at first illgrounded and which is undoubtedly heightened by an heated imagination but when you have first subdued your own temper so as to be able to speak calmly reasonably and kindly then expostulate with the person you suppose to be in faulthear what she has to say and either reconcile yourself to her or quiet your mind under the injury by the principle of christian charity but if it should appear that you yourself have been most to blame or if you have been in an error acknowledge it fairly and handsomely if you feel any reluctance to do so be certain that it arises from pride to conquer which is an absolute duty a soft answer turneth away wrath and a generous confession oftentimes more than atones for the fault which requires it truth and justice demand that we should acknowledge conviction as soon as we feel it and not maintain an erroneous opinion or justify a wrong conduct merely from the false shame of confessing our past ignorance a false shame it undoubtedly is and as impolitic as unjust since your error is already seen by those who endeavour to set you right but your conviction and the candour and generosity of owning it freely may still be an honour to you and would greatly recommend you to the person with whom you disputed with a disposition strongly inclined to sullenness or obstinacy this must be a very painful exertion and to make a perfect conquest over yourself at once may perhaps appear impracticable whilst the zeal of selfjustification and the abhorrence of blame are strong upon you but if you are so unhappy as to yield to your infirmity at one time do not let this discourage you from renewing your efforts your mind will gain strength from the contest and your internal enemy will by degrees be forced to give ground be not afraid to revive the subject as soon as you find yourself able to subdue your temper and then frankly lay open the conflict you sustained at the time by this you will make all the amends in your power for your fault and will certainly change the disgust you have given into pity at least if not admiration nothing is more endearing than such a confession and you will find such a satisfaction in your own consciousness and in the renewed tenderness and esteem you will gain from the person concerned that your task for the future will be made more easy and your reluctance to be convinced will on every occasion grow less and less  the love of truth and a real desire of improvement ought to be the only motives of argumentation and where these are sincere no difficulty can be made of embracing the truth as soon as it is perceived but in fact people oftener dispute from vanity and pride which makes it a grievous mortification to allow that we are the wiser for what we have heard from another to receive advice reproof and instruction properly is the surest sign of a sincere and humble heart and shows a greatness of mind which commands our respect and reverence while it appears so willingly to yield to us the superiority  observe notwithstanding that i do not wish you to hear of your faults without pain such an indifference would afford small hopes of amendment shame and remorse are the first steps to true repentance yet we should be willing to bear this pain and thankful to the kind hand that inflicts it for our good nor must we by sullen silence under it leave our kind physician in doubt whether the operation has taken effect or not or whether it has not added another malady instead of curing the first you must consider that those who tell you of your faults if they do it from motives of kindness and not of malice exert their friendship in a painful office which must have cost them as great an effort as it can be to you to acknowledge the service and if you refuse this encouragement you cannot expect that any one who is not absolutely obliged to it by duty will a second time undertake such an illrequited trouble what a loss would this be to yourselfhow difficult would be our progress to that degree of perfection which is necessary to our happiness was it not for the assistance we receive from each otherthis certainly is one of the means of grace held out to us by our merciful judge and if we reject it we are answerable for all the miscarriages we may fall into for want of it  i know not whether that strange caprice that inequality of taste and behaviour so commonly attributed to our sex may be properly called a fault of temperas it seems not to be connected with or arising from our animal framebut to be rather the fruit of our own selfindulgence degenerating by degrees into such a wantonness of will as knows not how to please itself when instead of regulating our actions by reason and principle we suffer ourselves to be guided by every slight and momentary impulse of inclination we shall doubtless appear so variable and inconstant that nobody can guess by our behaviour to day what may be expected from us tomorrow nor can we ourselves tell whether what we delighted in a week ago will now afford us the least degree of pleasure it is in vain for others to attempt to please uswe cannot please ourselves though all we could wish for waits our choice and thus does a capricious woman become sick of herself through very selfishness and when this is the case it is easy to judge how sick others must be of her and how contemptible and disgusting she must appear this wretched state is the usual consequence of power and flattery may my dear child never meet with the temptation of that excessive and illjudged indulgence from a husband which she has happily escaped from her parents and which seldom fails to reduce women to the miserable condition of a humoured child always unhappy from having nobodys will to study but its own the insolence of such demands for yourself and such disregard to the choice and inclinations of others can seldom fail to make you as many enemies as there are persons obliged to bear with your humours whilst a compliant reasonable and contented disposition would render you happy in yourself and beloved by all your companions particularly by those who live constantly with you and of what consequence this is to your happiness a moments reflection will convince you family friendships are the friendships made for us if i may so speak by god himself with the kindest intentions he has knit the bands of family love by indispensable duties and wretched are they who have burst them asunder by violence and illwill or worn them out by constant little disobligations and by the want of that attention to please which the presence of a stranger always inspires but which is so often shamefully neglected towards those whom it is most our duty and interest to please may you my dear be wise enough to see that every faculty of entertainment every engaging qualification which you possess is exerted to the best advantage for those whose love is of most importance to youfor those who live under the same roof and with whom you are connected for life either by the ties of blood or by the still more sacred obligations of a voluntary engagement  to make you the delight and darling of your family something more is required than barely to be exempt from illtemper and troublesome humours the sincere and genuine smiles of complacency and love must adorn your countenance that ready compliance that alertness to assist and oblige which demonstrates true affection must animate your behaviour and endear your most common action politeness must accompany your greatest familiarities and restrain you from every thing that is really offensive or which can give a moments unnecessary pain conversation which is so apt to grow dull and insipid in families nay in some to be almost wholly laid aside must be cultivated with the frankness and openness of friendship and by the mutual communication of whatever may conduce to the improvement or innocent entertainment of each other  reading whether apart or in common will furnish useful and pleasing subjects and the sprightliness of youth will naturally inspire harmless mirth and native humour if encouraged by a mutual desire of diverting each other and making the hours pass agreeably in your own house every amusement that offers will be heightened by the participation of these dear companions and by talking over every incident together and every object of pleasure if you have any acquired talent of entertainment such as music painting or the like your own family are those before whom you should most wish to excel and for whom you should always be ready to exert yourself not suffering the accomplishments which you have gained perhaps by their means and at their expense to lie dormant till the arrival of a stranger gives you spirit in the performance where this last is the case you may be sure vanity is the only motive of the exertion a stranger will praise you more but how little sensibility has that heart which is not more gratified by the silent pleasure painted on the countenance of a partial parent or of an affectionate brother than by the empty compliment of a visitor who is perhaps inwardly more disposed to criticise and ridicule than to admire you  i have been longer in this letter than i intended yet it is with difficulty i can quit the subject because i think it is seldom sufficiently insisted on either in books or in sermons and because there are many persons weak enough to believe themselves in a safe and innocent course of life whilst they are daily harassing every body about them by their vexatious humours but you will i hope constantly bear in mind that you can never treat a fellowcreature unkindly without offending the kind creator and father of all and that you can no way render yourself so acceptable to him as by studying to promote the happiness of others in every instance small as well as great the favour of god and the love of your companions will surely be deemed rewards sufficient to animate your most fervent endeavours yet this is not all the disposition of mind which i would recommend is its own reward and is in itself essential to happiness cultivate it therefore my dear child with your utmost diligence and watch the symptoms of illtemper as they rise with a firm resolution to conquer them before they are even perceived by any other person in every such inward conflict call upon our maker to assist the feeble nature he hath given you and sacrifice to him every feeling that would tempt you to disobedience so will you at length attain the true christian meekness which is blessed in the sight of god and man which has the promise of this life as well as of that which is to come then will you pity in others those infirmities which you have conquered in yourself and will think yourself as much bound to assist by your patience and gentleness those who are so unhappy as to be under the dominion of evil passions as you are to impart a share of your riches to the poor and miserable      adieu my dearest  footnotes     ecclus xix        letter vii  on economy       my dearest niece  economy is so important a part of a womans character so necessary to her own happiness and so essential to her performing properly the duties of a wife and of a mother that it ought to have the precedence of all other accomplishments and take its rank next to the first duties of life it is moreover an art as well as a virtue and many wellmeaning persons from ignorance or from inconsideration are strangely deficient in it indeed it is too often wholly neglected in a young womans education and she is sent from her fathers house to govern a family without the least degree of that knowledge which should qualify her for it this is the source of much inconvenience for though experience and attention may supply by degrees the want of instruction yet this requires time the family in the meantime may get into habits which are very difficult to alter and what is worse the husbands opinion of his wifes incapacity may be fixed too strongly to suffer him ever to think justly of her gradual improvements i would therefore earnestly advise you to make use of every opportunity you can find for the laying in some store of knowledge on this subject before you are called upon to the practice by observing what passes before youby consulting prudent and experienced mistresses of familiesand by entering in a book a memorandum of every new piece of intelligence you acquire you may afterwards compare these with more mature observations and you can make additions and corrections as you see occasion i hope it will not be long before your mother entrusts you with some part at least of the management of your fathers house whilst you are under her eye your ignorance cannot do much harm though the relief to her at first may not be near so considerable as the benefit to yourself  economy consists of so many branches some of which descend to such minutenesses that it is impossible for me in writing to give you particular directions the rude outlines may be perhaps described and i shall be happy if i can furnish you with any hint that may hereafter be usefully employed  the first and greatest point is to lay out your general plan of living in a just proportion to your fortune and rank if these two will not coincide the last must certainly give way for if you have right principles you cannot fail of being wretched under the sense of the injustice as well as danger of spending beyond your income and your distress will be continually increasing no mortifications which you can suffer from retrenching in your appearance can be comparable to this unhappiness if you would enjoy the real comforts of affluence you should lay your plan considerably within your income not for the pleasure of amassing wealththough where there is a growing family it is an absolute duty to lay by something every yearbut to provide for contingencies and to have the power of indulging your choice in the disposal of the overplus either in innocent pleasures or to increase your funds for charity and generosity which are in fact the true funds of pleasure in some circumstances indeed this would not be prudent there are professions in which a mans success greatly depends on his making some figure where the bare suspicion of poverty would bring on the reality if by marriage you should be placed in such a situation it will be your duty to exert all your skill in the management of your income yet even in this case i would not strain to the utmost for appearance but would choose my models among the most prudent and moderate of my own class and be contented with slower advancement for the sake of security and peace of mind  a contrary conduct is the ruin of many and in general the wives of men in such professions might live in a more retired and frugal manner than they do without any ill consequence if they did not make the scheme of advancing the success of their husbands an excuse to themselves for the indulgence of their own vanity and ambition  perhaps it may be said that the settling the general scheme of expenses is seldom the wifes province and that many men do not choose even to acquaint her with the real state of their affairs where this is the case a woman can be answerable for no more than is entrusted to her but i think it a very ill sign for one or both of the parties where there is such a want of openness in what equally concerns them as i trust you will deserve the confidence of your husband so i hope you will be allowed free consultation with him on your mutual interest and i believe there are few men who would not hearken to reason on their own affairs when they saw a wife ready and desirous to give up her share of vanities and indulgences and only earnest to promote the common good of the family  in order to settle your plan it will be necessary to make a pretty exact calculation and if from this time you accustom yourself to calculations in all the little expenses entrusted to you you will grow expert and ready at them and be able to guess very nearly where certainty cannot be obtained many articles of expense are regular and fixed these may be valued exactly and by consulting with experienced persons you may calculate nearly the amount of others any material article of consumption in a family of any given number and circumstances may be estimated pretty nearly your own expenses of clothes and pocketmoney should be settled and circumscribed that you may be sure not to exceed the just proportion i think it an admirable method to appropriate such a portion of your income as you judge proper to bestow in charity to be sacredly kept for that purpose and no longer considered as your own by which means you will avoid the temptation of giving less than you ought through selfishness or more than you ought through goodnature or weakness if your circumstances allow of it you might set apart another fund for acts of liberality or friendship which do not come under the head of charity the having such funds ready at hand makes it easy and pleasant to give and when acts of bounty are performed without effort they are generally done more kindly and effectually if you are obliged in conscience to lay up for a family the same method of an appropriated fund for saving will be of excellent use as it will prevent that continual and often ineffectual anxiety which a general desire of saving without having fixed the limits is sure to create  regularity of payments and accounts is essential to economyyour housekeeping should be settled at least once a week and all the bills paid all other tradesmen should be paid at furthest once a year indeed i think it more advantageous to pay oftener but if you make them trust you longer they must either charge proportionally higher or be losers by your custom numbers of them fail every year from the cruel cause of being obliged to give their customers so much longer credit than the dealers from whom they take their goods will allow to them if people of fortune considered this they would not defer their payments from mere negligence as they often do to the ruin of whole families  you must endeavour to acquire skill in purchasing in order to this you should begin now to attend to the prices of things and take every proper opportunity of learning the real value of every thing as well as the marks whereby you are to distinguish the good from the bad  in your table as in your dress and in all other things i wish you to aim at propriety and neatness or if your state demands it elegance rather than superfluous figure to go beyond your sphere either in dress or in the appearance of your table indicates a greater fault in your character than to be too much within it it is impossible to enter into the minutiæ of the table good sense and observation on the best models must form your taste and a due regard to what you can afford must restrain it  ladies who are fond of needlework generally choose to consider that as a principal part of good housewifery and though i cannot look upon it as of equal importance with the due regulation of a family yet in a middling rank and with a moderate fortune it is a necessary part of a womans duty and a considerable article in expense is saved by it many young ladies make almost every thing they wear by which means they can make a genteel figure at a small expense this in your station is the most profitable and desirable kind of work and as much of it as you can do consistently with a due attention to your health to the improvement of your mind and to the discharge of other duties i should think highly commendable but as i do not wish you to impose upon the world by your appearance i should be contented to see you worse dressed rather than see your whole time employed in preparations for it or any of those hours given to it which are needful to make your body strong and active by exercise or your mind rational by reading absolute idleness is inexcusable in a woman because the needle is always at hand for those intervals in which she cannot be otherwise employed if you are industrious and if you keep good hours you will find time for all your proper employments early rising and a good disposition of time is essential to economy the necessary orders and examinations into household affairs should be dispatched as soon in the day and as privately as possible that they may not interrupt your husband or guests or break in upon conversation or reading in the remainder of the day if you defer any thing that is necessary you may be tempted by company or by unforeseen avocations to forget or to neglect it hurry and irregularity will ensue with expensive expedients to supply the defect  there is in many people and particularly in youth a strange aversion to regularitya desire to delay what ought to be done immediately in order to do something else which might as well be done afterwards be assured it is of more consequence to you than you can conceive to get the better of this idle procrastinating spirit and to acquire habits of constancy and steadiness even in the most trifling matters without them there can be no regularity or consistency of action or characterno dependence on your best intentions which a sudden humour may tempt you to lay aside for a time and which a thousand unforeseen accidents will afterwards render it more and more difficult to execute no one can say what important consequences may follow a trivial neglect of this kind for examplei have known one of these procrastinators disoblige and gradually lose very valuable friends by delaying to write to them so long that having no good excuse to offer she could not get courage enough to write at all and dropped their correspondence entirely  the neatness and order of your house and furniture is a part of economy which will greatly affect your appearance and character and to which you must yourself give attention since it is not possible even for the rich and great to rely wholly on the care of servants in such points without their being often neglected the more magnificently a house is furnished the more one is disgusted with that air of confusion which often prevails where attention is wanting in the owner but on the other hand there is a kind of neatness which gives a lady the air of a housemaid and makes her excessively troublesome to every body and particularly to her husband in this as in all other branches of economy i wish you to avoid all parade and bustle those ladies who pique themselves on the particular excellence of neatness are very apt to forget that the decent order of the house should be designed to promote the convenience and pleasure of those who are to be in it and that if it is converted into a cause of trouble and constraint their husbands and guests would be happier without it the love of fame that universal passion will sometimes show itself on strangely insignificant subjects and a person who acts for praise only will always go beyond the mark in every thing the best sign of a house being well governed is that nobodys attention is called to any of the little affairs of it but all goes on so well of course that one is not led to make remarks upon any thing nor to observe any extraordinary effort that produces the general result of ease and elegance which prevails throughout  domestic economy and the credit and happiness of a family depend so much on the choice and proper regulation of servants that it must be considered as an essential part both of prudence and duty those who keep a great number of them have a heavy charge on their consciences and ought to think themselves in some measure responsible for the morals and happiness of so many of their fellowcreatures designed like themselves for immortality indeed the cares of domestic management are by no means lighter to persons of high rank and fortune if they perform their duty than to those of a retired station it is with a family as with a commonwealth the more numerous and luxurious it becomes the more difficult it is to govern it properly though the great are placed above the little attentions and employments to which a private gentlewoman must dedicate much of her time they have a larger and more important sphere of action in which if they are indolent and neglectful the whole government of their house and fortune must fall into irregularity whatever number of deputies they may employ to overlook their affairs they must themselves overlook those deputies and be ultimately answerable for the conduct of the whole the characters of those servants who are entrusted with power over the rest cannot be too nicely inquired into and the mistress of the family must be ever watchful over their conduct at the same time that she must carefully avoid every appearance of suspicion which whilst it wounds and hinders a worthy servant only excites the artifice and cunning of an unjust one  none who pretend to be friends of religion and virtue should ever keep a domestic however expert in business whom they know to be guilty of immorality how unbecoming a serious character is it to say of such an one he is a bad man but a good servant what a preference does it show of private convenience to the interests of society which demand that vice should be constantly discountenanced especially in every ones own household and that the sober honest and industrious should be sure of finding encouragement and reward in the houses of those who maintain respectable characters such persons should be invariably strict and peremptory with regard to the behaviour of their servants in every thing which concerns the general plan of domestic government but should by no means be severe on small faults since nothing so much weakens authority as frequent chiding whilst they require precise obedience to their rules they must prove by their general conduct that these rules are the effect not of humour but of reason it is wonderful that those who are careful to conceal their illtemper from strangers should be indifferent how peevish and even contemptibly capricious they appear before their servants on whom their good name so much depends and from whom they can hope for no real respect when their weakness is so apparent when once a servant can say i cannot do any thing to please my mistress today all authority is lost  those who continually change their servants and complain of perpetual ill usage have good reason to believe that the fault is in themselves and that they do not know how to govern few indeed possess the skill to unite authority with kindness or are capable of that steady and uniformly reasonable conduct which alone can maintain true dignity and command a willing and attentive obedience let us not forget that human nature is the same in all stations if you can convince your servants that you have a generous and considerate regard to their health their interest and their reasonable gratificationsthat you impose no commands but what are fit and right nor ever reprove but with justice and temperwhy should you imagine that they will be insensible to the good they receive or whence suppose them incapable of esteeming and prizing such a mistress i could never without indignation hear it said that servants have no gratitude as if the condition of servitude excluded the virtues of humanity the truth is masters and mistresses have seldom any real claim to gratitude they think highly of what they bestow and little of the service they receive they consider only their own convenience and seldom reflect on the kind of life their servants pass with them they do not ask themselves whether it is such an one as is consistent with the preservation of their health their morals their leisure for religious duties or with a proper share of the enjoyments and comforts of life the dissipated manners which now so generally prevail perpetual absence from home and attendance on assemblies or at public places is in all these respects pernicious to the whole household and to the menservants absolutely ruinous their only resource in the tedious hours of waiting whilst their masters and ladies are engaged in diversions is to find out something of the same kind for themselves thus they are led into gaming drinking extravagance and bad company and thus by a natural progression they become distressed and dishonest that attachment and affiance which ought to subsist between the dependant and his protector are destroyed the master looks on his attendants as thieves and traitors whilst they consider him as one whose money only gives him power over them and who uses that power without the least regard to their welfare    the fool saith i have no friendsi have no thanks for all my good deeds and they that eat my bread speak evil of me thus foolishly do those complain who choose their servants as well as their friends without discretion or who treat them in a manner that no worthy person will bear  i have been often shocked at the want of politeness by which masters and mistresses sometimes provoke impertinence from their servants a gentleman who would resent to death an imputation of falsehood from his equal will not scruple without proof to accuse his servant of it in the grossest terms i have heard the most insolent contempt of the whole class expressed at a table whilst five or six of them attended behind the chairs who the company seemed to think were without senses without understanding or the natural feelings of resentment these are cruel injuries and will be retorted in some way or other  if you my dear live to be at the head of a family i hope you will not only avoid all injurious treatment of your domestics but behave to them with that courtesy and good breeding which will heighten their respect as well as their affection if on any occasion they do more than you have a right to require give them at least the reward of seeing that they have obliged you if in your service they have any hardship to endure let them see that you are concerned for the necessity of imposing it when they are sick give them all the attention and every comfort in your power with a free heart and kind countenance   not blemishing thy good deeds not using uncomfortable words when thou givest any thing is not a word better than a gift but both are with a gracious man a fool will upbraid churlishly and a gift of the envious consumeth the eyes  whilst you thus endear yourself to all your servants you must ever carefully avoid making a favourite of any unjust distinctions and weak indulgences to one will of course excite envy and hatred in the rest your favourite may establish whatever abuses she pleases none will dare to complain against her and you will be kept ignorant of her ill practices but will feel the effects of them by finding all your other servants uneasy in their places and perhaps by being obliged continually to change them  when they have spent a reasonable time in your service and have behaved commendably you ought to prefer them if it is in your power or to recommend them to a better provision the hope of this keeps alive attention and gratitude and is the proper support of industry like a parent you should keep in view their establishment in some way that may preserve their old age from indigence and to this end you should endeavour to inspire them with care to lay up part of their gains and constantly discourage in them all vanity in dress and extravagance in idle expenses that you are bound to promote their eternal as well as temporal welfare you cannot doubt since next to your children they are your nearest dependants you ought therefore to instruct them as far as you are able furnish them with good books suited to their capacity and see that they attend the public worship of god and you must take care so to pass the sabbathday as to allow them time on that day at least for reading and reflection at home as well as for attendance at church though this is part of your religious duty i mention it here because it is also a part of family management for the same reason i shall here take occasion earnestly to recommend family prayers which are useful to all but more particularly to servants who being constantly employed are led to the neglect of private prayer and whose ignorance makes it very difficult for them to frame devotions for themselves or to choose proper helps amidst the numerous books of superstitious or enthusiastic nonsense which are printed for that purpose even in a political light this practice is eligible since the idea which it will give them of your regularity and decency if not counteracted by other parts of your conduct will probably increase their respect for you and will be some restraint at least on their outward behaviour though it should fail of that inward influence which in general may be hoped from it  the prudent distribution of your charitable gifts may not improperly be considered as a branch of economy since the great duty of almsgiving cannot be truly fulfilled without a diligent attention so to manage the sums you can spare as to produce the most real good to your fellowcreatures many are willing to give money who will not bestow their time and consideration and who therefore often hurt the community when they mean to do good to individuals the larger are your funds the stronger is the call upon you to exert your industry and care in disposing of them properly it seems impossible to give rules for this as every case is attended with a variety of circumstances which must all be considered in general charity is most useful when it is appropriated to animate the industry of the young to procure some ease and comforts to old age and to support in sickness those whose daily labour is their only maintenance in health they who are fallen into indigence from circumstances of ease and plenty and in whom education and habit have added a thousand wants to those of nature must be considered with the tenderest sympathy by every feeling heart it is needless to say that to such the bare support of existence is scarcely a benefit and that the delicacy and liberality of the manner in which relief is here offered can alone make it a real act of kindness in great families the waste of provisions sufficient for the support of many poor ones is a shocking abuse of the gifts of providence nor should any lady think it beneath her to study the best means of preventing it and of employing the refuse of luxury in the relief of the poor even the smallest families may give some assistance in this way if care is taken that nothing be wasted  i am sensible my dear child that very little more can be gathered from what i have said on economy than the general importance of it which cannot be too much impressed on your mind since the natural turn of young people is to neglect and even to despise it not distinguishing it from parsimony and narrowness of spirit but be assured my dear there can be no true generosity without it and that the most enlarged and liberal mind will find itself not debased but ennobled by it nothing is more common than to see the same person whose want of economy is ruining his family consumed with regret and vexation at the effect of his profusion and by endeavouring to save in such trifles as will not amount to twenty pounds in a year that which he wastes by hundreds incur the character and suffer the anxieties of a miser together with the misfortunes of a prodigal a rational plan of expense will save you from all these corroding cares and will give you the full and liberal enjoyment of what you spend an air of ease of hospitality and frankness will reign in your house which will make it pleasant to your friends and to yourself better is a morsel of bread where this is found than the most elaborate entertainment with that air of constraint and anxiety which often betrays the grudging heart through all the disguises of civility  that you my dear may unite in yourself the admirable virtues of generosity and economy which will be the grace and crown of all your attainments is the earnest wish of      your ever affectionate  footnotes     ecclus xx        ecclus xviii     letter viii  on politeness and accomplishments   whilst you labour to enrich your mind with the essential virtues of christianitywith piety benevolence meekness humility integrity and purityand to make yourself useful in domestic management i would not have my dear child neglect to pursue those graces and acquirements which may set her virtue in the most advantageous light adorn her manners and enlarge her understanding and this not in the spirit of vanity but in the innocent and laudable view of rendering herself more useful and pleasing to her fellowcreatures and consequently more acceptable to god politeness of behaviour and the attainment of such branches of knowledge and such arts and accomplishments as are proper to your sex capacity and station will prove so valuable to yourself through life and will make you so desirable a companion that the neglect of them may reasonably be deemed a neglect of duty since it is undoubtedly our duty to cultivate the powers entrusted to us and to render ourselves as perfect as we can  you must have often observed that nothing is so strong a recommendation on a slight acquaintance as politeness nor does it lose its value by time or intimacy when preserved as it ought to be in the nearest connections and strictest friendships this delightful qualificationso universally admired and respected but so rarely possessed in any eminent degreecannot but be a considerable object of my wishes for you nor should either of us be discouraged by the apprehension that neither i am capable of teaching nor you of learning it in perfection since whatever degree you attain will amply reward our pains  to be perfectly polite one must have great presence of mind with a delicate and quick sense of propriety or in other words one should be able to form an instantaneous judgment of what is fittest to be said or done on every occasion as it offers i have known one or two persons who seemed to owe this advantage to nature only and to have the peculiar happiness of being born as it were with another sense by which they had an immediate perception of what was proper and improper in cases absolutely new to them but this is the lot of very few in general propriety of behaviour must be the fruit of instruction of observation and reasoning and is to be cultivated and improved like any other branch of knowledge or virtue a good temper is a necessary groundwork of it and if to this is added a good understanding applied industriously to this purpose i think it can hardly fail of attaining all that is essential in it particular modes and ceremonies of behaviour vary in different countries and even in different parts of the same town these can only be learned by observation on the manners of those who are best skilled in them and by keeping what is called good company but the principles of politeness are the same in all places wherever there are human beings it must be impolite to hurt the temper or to shock the passions of those you converse with it must every where be goodbreeding to set your companions in the most advantageous point of light by giving each the opportunity of displaying their most agreeable talents and by carefully avoiding all occasions of exposing their defectsto exert your own endeavours to please and to amuse but not to outshine themto give each their due share of attention and noticenot engrossing the talk when others are desirous to speak nor suffering the conversation to flag for want of introducing something to continue or renew a subjectnot to push your advantages in argument so far that your antagonist cannot retreat with honourin short it is an universal duty in society to consider others more than yourselfin honour preferring one another christianity in this rule gives the best lesson of politeness yet judgment must be used in the application of it our humility must not be strained so far as to distress those we mean to honour we must not quit our proper rank nor force others to treat us improperly or to accept what we mean as an advantage against their wills we should be perfectly easy and make others so if we can but this happy ease belongs perhaps to the last stage of perfection in politeness and can hardly be attained till we are conscious that we know the rules of behaviour and are not likely to offend against propriety in a very young person who has seen little or nothing of the world this cannot be expected but a real desire of obliging and a respectful attention will in a great measure supply the want of knowledge and will make every one ready to overlook those deficiencies which are owing only to the want of opportunities to observe the manners of polite company you ought not therefore to be too much depressed by the consciousness of such deficiencies but endeavour to get above the shame of wanting what you have not had the means of acquiring nothing heightens this false shame and the awkwardness it occasions so much as vanity the humble mind contented to be known for what it is and unembarrassed by the dread of betraying its ignorance is present to itself and can command the use of understanding which will generally preserve you from any great indecorum and will secure you from that ridicule which is the punishment of affectation rather than of ignorance people of sense will never despise you whilst you act naturally but the moment you attempt to step out of your own character you make yourself an object of just ridicule  many are of opinion that a very young woman can hardly be too silent and reserved in company and certainly nothing is so disgusting in youth as pertness and selfconceit but modesty should be distinguished from an awkward bashfulness and silence should be only enjoined when it would be forward and impertinent to talk there are many proper opportunities for a girl young even as you are to speak in company with advantage to herself and if she does it without conceit or affectation she will always be more pleasing than those who sit like statues without sense or motion when you are silent your looks should show your attention and presence to the company a respectful and earnest attention is the most delicate kind of praise and never fails to gratify and please you must appear to be interested in what is said and endeavour to improve yourself by it if you understand the subject well enough to ask now and then a pertinent question or if you can mention any circumstances relating to it that have not before been taken notice of this will be an agreeable way of showing your willingness to make a part of the company and will probably draw a particular application to you from some one or other then when called upon you must not draw back as unwilling to answer nor confine yourself merely to yes or no as is the custom of many young persons who become intolerable burdens to the mistress of the house whilst she strives in vain to draw them into notice and to give them some share in the conversation  in your fathers house it is certainly proper for you to pay civility to the guests and to talk to them in your turnwith modesty and respectif they encourage you to it young ladies of near your own age who visit there fall of course to your share to entertain but whilst you exert yourself to make their visit agreeable to them you must not forget what is due to the elder part of the company nor by whispering and laughing apart give them cause to suspect what is too often true that they themselves are the subjects of your mirth it is so shocking an outrage against society to talk of or laugh at any person in his own presence that one would only think it could be committed by the vulgar i am sorry however to say that i have too often observed it amongst young ladies who little deserved that title whilst they indulged their overflowing spirits in defiance of decency and goodnature the desire of laughing will make such inconsiderate young persons find a subject of ridicule even in the most respectable character old age whichif not disgraced by vice or affectationhas the justest title to reverence will be mimicked and insulted and even personal defects and infirmities will too often excite contempt and abuse instead of compassion if you have ever been led into such an action my dear girl call it seriously to mind when you are confessing your faults to almighty god and be fully persuaded that it is not one of the least which you have to repent of you will be immediately convinced of this by comparing it with the great rule of justice that of doing to all as you would they should do unto you no person living is insensible to the injury of contempt nor is there any talent so invidious or so certain to create illwill as that of ridicule the natural effects of years which all hope to attain and the infirmities of the body which none can prevent are surely of all others the most improper objects of mirth there are subjects enough that are innocent and on which you may freely indulge the vivacity of your spirits for i would not condemn you to perpetual seriousness on the contrary i delight in a joyous temper at all ages and particularly at yours delicate and goodnatured raillery amongst equal friends if pointed only against such trifling errors as the owner can hardly join to laugh at or such qualities as they do not pique themselves upon is both agreeable and useful but then it must be offered in perfect kindness and sincere goodhumour if tinctured with the least degree of malice its sting becomes venomous and detestable the person rallied should have liberty and ability to return the jest which must be dropped upon the first appearance of its affecting the temper  you will wonder perhaps when i tell you that there are some characters in the world which i would freely allow you to laugh atthough not in their presence extravagant vanity and affectation are the natural subjects of ridicule which is their proper punishment when you see old people instead of maintaining the dignity of their years struggling against nature to conceal them affecting the graces and imitating the follies of youthor a young person assuming the importance and solemnity of old agei do not wish you to be insensible to the ridicule of such absurd deviations from truth and nature you are welcome to laugh when you leave the company provided you lay up a lesson for yourself at the same time and remember that unless you improve your mind whilst you are young you also will be an insignificant fool in old age and that if you are presuming and arrogant in youth you are as ridiculous as an old woman with a headdress of flowers  in a young ladys behaviour towards gentlemen great delicacy is certainly required yet i believe women oftener err from too great a consciousness of the supposed views of men than from inattention to those views or want of caution against them you are at present rather too young to want rules on this subject but i could wish that you should behave almost in the same manner three years hence as now and retain the simplicity and innocence of childhood with the sense and dignity of riper years men of loose morals or impertinent behaviour must always be avoided or if at any time you are obliged to be in their company you must keep them at a distance by cold civility but with regard to those gentlemen whom your parents think it proper for you to converse with and who give no offence by their own manners to them i wish you to behave with the same frankness and simplicity as if they were of your own sex if you have natural modesty you will never transgress its bounds whilst you converse with a man as one rational creature with another without any view to the possibility of a lover or admirer where nothing of that kind is professed where it is i hope you will ever be equally a stranger to coquetry and prudery and that you will be able to distinguish the effects of real esteem and love from idle gallantry and unmeaning fine speeches the slighter notice you take of these last the better and that rather with goodhumoured contempt than with affected gravity but the first must be treated with seriousness and wellbred sincerity not giving the least encouragement which you do not mean nor assuming airs of contempt where it is not deserved but this belongs to a subject which i have touched upon in a former letter i have already told you that you will be unsafe in every step which leads to a serious attachment unless you consult your parents from the first moment you apprehend any thing of that sort to be intended let them be your first confidants and let every part of your conduct in such a case be particularly directed by them  with regard to accomplishments the chief of these is a competent share of reading well chosen and properly regulated and of this i shall speak more largely hereafter dancing and the knowledge of the french tongue are now so universal that they cannot be dispensed with in the education of a gentlewoman and indeed they both are useful as well as ornamental the first by forming and strengthening the body and improving the carriage the second by opening a large field of entertainment and improvement for the mind i believe there are more agreeable books of female literature in french than in any other language and as they are not less commonly talked of than english books you must often feel mortified in company if you are too ignorant to read them italian would be easily learnt after french and if you have leisure and opportunity may be worth your gaining though in your station of life it is by no means necessary  to write a free and legible hand and to understand common arithmetic are indispensable requisites  as to music and drawing i would only wish you to follow as genius leads you have some turn for the first and i should be sorry to see you neglect a talent which will at least afford you an innocent amusement though it should not enable you to give much pleasure to your friends i think the use of both these arts is more for yourself than for others it is but seldom that a private person has leisure or application enough to gain any high degree of excellence in them and your own partial family are perhaps the only persons who would not much rather be entertained by the performance of a professor than by yours but with regard to yourself it is of great consequence to have the power of filling up agreeably those intervals of time which too often hang heavily on the hands of a woman if her lot be cast in a retired situation besides this it is certain that even a small share of knowledge in these arts will heighten your pleasure in the performances of others the taste must be improved before it can be susceptible of an exquisite relish for any of the imitative arts an unskilful ear is seldom capable of comprehending harmony or of distinguishing the most delicate charms of melody the pleasure of seeing fine paintings or even of contemplating the beauties of nature must be greatly heightened by our being conversant with the rules of drawing and by the habit of considering the most picturesque objects as i look upon taste to be an inestimable fund of innocent delight i wish you to lose no opportunity of improving it and of cultivating in yourself the relish of such pleasures as will not interfere with a rational scheme of life nor lead you into dissipation with all its attendant evils of vanity and luxury  as to the learned languages though i respect the abilities and application of those ladies who have attained them and who make a modest and proper use of them yet i would by no means advise youor any other woman who is not strongly impelled by a particular geniusto engage in such studies the labour and time which they require are generally incompatible with our natures and proper employments the real knowledge which they supply is not essential since the english french or italian tongues afford tolerable translations of all the most valuable productions of antiquity besides the multitude of original authors which they furnish and these are much more than sufficient to store your mind with as many ideas as you will know how to manage the danger of pedantry and presumption in a womanof her exciting envy in one sex and jealousy in the otherof her exchanging the graces of imagination for the severity and preciseness of a scholar would be i own sufficient to frighten me from the ambition of seeing my girl remarkable for learning such objections are perhaps still stronger with regard to the abstruse sciences  whatever tends to embellish your fancy to enlighten your understanding and furnish you with ideas to reflect upon when alone or to converse upon in company is certainly well worth your acquisition the wretched expedient to which ignorance so often drives our sex of calling in slander to enliven the tedious insipidity of conversation would alone be a strong reason for enriching your mind with innocent subjects of entertainment which may render you a fit companion for persons of sense and knowledge from whom you may reap the most desirable improvements for though i think reading indispensably necessary to the due cultivation of your mind i prefer the conversation of such persons to every other method of instruction but this you cannot hope to enjoy unless you qualify yourself to bear a part in such society by at least a moderate share of reading  though religion is the most important of all your pursuits there are not many books on that subject which i should recommend to you at present controversy is wholly improper at your age and it is also too soon for you to enquire into the evidence of the truth of revelation or to study the difficult parts of scripture when these shall come before you there are many excellent books from which you may receive great assistance at present practical divinityclear of superstition and enthusiasm but addressed to the heart and written with a warmth and spirit capable of exciting in it pure and rational pietyis what i wish you to meet with  the principal study i would recommend is history i know of nothing equally proper to entertain and improve at the same time or that is so likely to form and strengthen your judgment and by giving you a liberal and comprehensive view of human nature in some measure to supply the defect of that experience which is usually attained too late to be of much service to us let me add that more materials for conversation are supplied by this kind of knowledge than by almost any other but i have more to say to you on this subject in a future letter  the faculty in which women usually most excel is that of imagination and when properly cultivated it becomes the source of all that is most charming in society nothing you can read will so much contribute to the improvement of this faculty as poetry which if applied to its true ends adds a thousand charms to those sentiments of religion virtue generosity and delicate tenderness by which the human soul is exalted and refined i hope you are not deficient in natural taste for this enchanting art but that you will find it one of your greatest pleasures to be conversant with the best poets whom our language can bring you acquainted with particularly those immortal ornaments of our nation shakspeare and milton the first is not only incomparably the noblest genius in dramatic poetry but the greatest master of nature and the most perfect characterizer of men and manners in this last point of view i think him inestimable and i am persuaded that in the course of your life you will seldom find occasion to correct those observations on human nature and those principles of morality which you may extract from his capital pieces you will at first find his language difficult but if you take the assistance of a friend who understands it well you will by degrees enter into his manner of phraseology and perceive a thousand beauties which at first lay buried in obsolete words and uncouth constructions the admirable essay on shakespeare which has lately appeared so much to the honour of our sex will open your mind to the peculiar excellences of this author and enlighten your judgment on dramatic poetry in general with such force of reason and brilliancy of wit as cannot fail to delight as well as instruct you  our great english poet milton is as far above my praise as his paradise lost is above any thing which i am able to read except the sacred writers the sublimity of his subject sometimes leads him into abstruseness but many parts of his great poem are easy to all comprehensions and must find their way directly to every heart by the tenderness and delicacy of his sentiments in which he is not less strikingly excellent than in the richness and sublimity of his imagination addisons criticism in the spectators written with that beauty elegance and judgment which distinguish all his writings will assist you to understand and to relish this poem  it is needless to recommend to you the translations of homer and virgil which every body reads that reads at all you must have heard that homer is esteemed the father of poetry the original from whence all the modernsnot excepting milton himselfborrow some of their greatest beauties and from whom they extract those rules for composition which are found most agreeable to nature and true taste virgil you know is the next in rank among the classics you will read his eneid with extreme pleasure if ever you are able to read italian in annibal caros translation the idiom of the latin and italian languages being more alike it is i believe much closer yet preserves more of the spirit of the original than the english translations  for the rest fame will point out to you the most considerable of our poets and i would not exclude any of name among those whose morality is unexceptionable but of poets as of all other authors i wish you to read only such as are properly recommended to yousince there are many who debase their divine art by abusing it to the purposes of vice and impiety if you could read poetry with a judicious friend who could lead your judgment to a true discernment of its beauties and defects it would inexpressibly heighten both your pleasure and improvement but before you enter upon this some acquaintance with the heathen mythology is necessary i think that you must before now have met with some book under the title of the pantheon   and if once you know as much of the gods and goddesses as the most common books on the subject will tell you the rest may be learned by reading homer but then you must particularly attend to him in this view i do not expect you to penetrate those numerous mysteriesthose amazing depths of morality religion and metaphysicswhich some pretend to have discovered in his mythology but to know the names and principal offices of the gods and goddesses with some idea of their moral meaning seems requisite to the understanding almost any poetical composition as an instance of the moral meaning i speak of i will mention an observation of bossuet that homers poetry was particularly recommended to the greeks by the superiority which he ascribes to them over the asiatics this superiority is shown in the iliad not only in the conquest of asia by the greeks and in the actual destruction of its capital but in the division and arrangement of the gods who took part with the contending nations on the side of asia was venusthat is sensual passionpleasureand effeminacy on the side of greece was junothat is matronly gravity and conjugal love together with mercuryinvention and eloquenceand jupiteror political wisdom on the side of asia was mars who represents brutal valour and blind fury on that of greece was pallasthat is military discipline and bravery guarded by judgment  this and many other instances that might be produced will show you how much of the beauty of the poets art must be lost to you without some notion of these allegorical personages boys in their school learning have this kind of knowledge impressed on their minds by a variety of books but women who do not go through the same course of instruction are very apt to forget what little they read or hear on the subject i advise you therefore never to lose an opportunity of enquiring into the meaning of any thing you meet with in poetry or in painting alluding to the history of any of the heathen deities and of obtaining from some friend an explanation of its connection with true history or of its allegorical reference to morality or to physics  natural philosophy in the largest sense of the expression is too wide a field for you to undertake but the study of nature as far as may suit your powers and opportunities you will find a most sublime entertainment the objects of this study are all the stupendous works of the almighty hand that lie within the reach of our observation in the works of man perfection is aimed at but it can only be found in those of the creator the contemplation of perfection must produce delight and every natural object around you would offer this delight if it could attract your attention if you survey the earth every leaf that trembles in the breeze every blade of grass beneath your feet is a wonder as absolutely beyond the reach of human art to imitate as the construction of the universe endless pleasures to those who have a taste for them might be derived from the endless variety to be found in the composition of this globe and its inhabitants the fossilthe vegetableand the animal worldgradually rising in the scale of excellencethe innumerable species of each still preserving their specific differences from age to age yet of which no two individuals are ever perfectly alikeafford such a range for observation and enquiry as might engross the whole term of our short life if followed minutely besides all the animal creation obvious to our unassisted senses the eye aided by philosophical inventions sees myriads of creatures which by the ignorant are not known to have existence it sees all nature teem with life every fluideach part of every vegetable and animalswarm with its peculiar inhabitantsinvisible to the naked eye but as perfect in all their parts and enjoying life as indisputably as the elephant or the whale  but if from the earth and from these minute wonders the philosophic eye is raised towards the heavens what a stupendous scene there opens to its viewthose brilliant lights that sparkle to the eye of ignorance as gems adorning the sky or as lamps to guide the traveller by night assume an importance that amazes the understandingthey appear to be worlds formed like ours for a variety of inhabitantsor suns enlightening numberless other worlds too distant for our discovery i shall ever remember the astonishment and rapture with which my mind received this idea when i was about your age it was then perfectly new to me and it is impossible to describe the sensations i felt from the glorious boundless prospect of infinite beneficence bursting at once upon my imagination who can contemplate such a scene unmoved if our curiosity is excited to enter upon this noble enquiry a few books on the subject and those of the easiest sort with some of the common experiments may be sufficient for your purposewhich is to enlarge your mind and to excite in it the most ardent gratitude and profound adoration towards that great and good being who exerts his boundless power in communicating various portions of happiness through all the immense regions of creation  moral philosophy as it relates to human actions is of still higher importance than the study of nature the works of the ancients on this subject are universally said to be entertaining as well as instructive by those who can read them in their original languages and such of them as are well translated will undoubtedly some years hence afford you great pleasure and improvement you will also find many agreeable and useful books written originally in french and in english on morals and manners for the present there are works which without assuming the solemn air of philosophy will enlighten your mind on these subjects and introduce instruction in an easier dress of this sort are many of the moral essays that have appeared in periodical papers which when excellent in their kindas are the spectators guardians ramblers and adventurersare particularly useful to young people as they comprehend a great variety of subjectsintroduce many ideas and observations that are new to themand lead to a habit of reflecting on the characters and events that come before them in real life which i consider as the best exercise of the understanding  books on taste and criticism will hereafter be more proper for you than at present whatever can improve your discernment and render your taste elegant and just must be of great consequence to your enjoyments as well as to the embellishment of your understanding  i would by no means exclude the kind of reading which young people are naturally most fond of though i think the greatest care should be taken in the choice of those fictitious stories that so enchant the mind most of which tend to inflame the passions of youth whilst the chief purpose of education should be to moderate and restrain them add to this that both the writing and sentiments of most novels and romances are such as are only proper to vitiate your style and to mislead your heart and understanding the expectation of extraordinary adventureswhich seldom ever happen to the sober and prudent part of mankindand the admiration of extravagant passions and absurd conduct are some of the usual fruits of this kind of reading which when a young woman makes it her chief amusement generally render her ridiculous in conversation and miserably wrongheaded in her pursuits and behaviour there are however works of this class in which excellent morality is joined with the most lively pictures of the human mind and with all that can entertain the imagination and interest the heart but i must repeatedly exhort you never to read any thing of the sentimental kind without taking the judgment of your best friends in the choice for i am persuaded that the indiscriminate reading of such kind of books corrupts more female hearts than any other cause whatsoever  before i close this correspondence i shall point out the course of history i wish you to pursue and give you my thoughts of geography and chronology some knowledge of both being in my opinion necessary to the reading of history with any advantage      i am my dearest niece        your ever affectionate  footnote     there has been lately published a work particularly adapted to the use of young ladies entitled a dictionary of polite literature or fabulous history of heathen gods and illustrious heroes two vols with plates         editor     letter ix  on geography and chronology       my dearest niece  i have told you that you will not be able to read history with much pleasure or advantage without some little knowledge of geography and chronology they are both very easily attainedi mean in the degree that will be necessary for you you must be sensible that you can know but little of a country whose situation with respect to the rest of the world you are entirely ignorant of and that it is to little purpose that you are able to mention a fact if you cannot nearly ascertain the time in which it happened which alone in many cases gives importance to the fact itself  in geographythe easiest of all sciences and the best adapted to the capacity of childreni suppose you to have made some beginning to know at least the figure of the earththe supposed linesthe degreeshow to measure distancesand a few of the common terms if you do not already know these two or three lessons will be sufficient to attain them the rest is the work of memory and is easily gained by reading with maps for i do not wish your knowledge to be exact and masterly but such only as is necessary for the purpose of understanding history and without which even a newspaper would be unintelligible it may be sufficient for this end if with respect to ancient geography you have a general idea of the situation of all the great states without being able precisely to ascertain their limits but in the modern you ought to know the bounds and extent of every state in europe and its situation with respect to the rest the other parts of the world will require less accurate knowledge except with regard to the european settlements  it may be an useful and agreeable method when you learn the situation of any important country to join with that knowledge some one or two leading facts or circumstances concerning it so that its particular property may always put you in mind of the situation and the situation in like manner recal the particular property when for instance you learn in what part of the globe to find ethiopia to be told at the same time that in that vast unknown tract of country the christian religion was once the religion of the state would be of service because the geographical and historical knowledge would assist each other thus to join with egypt the nurse and parent of arts and of superstitionwith persia shocking despotism and perpetual revolutionswith ancient greece freedom and geniuswith scythia hardiness and conquest are hints which you may make use of as you please perhaps annexing to any country the idea of some familiar form which it most resembles may at first assist you to retain a general notion of it thus italy has been called a boot and europe compared to a woman sitting  the difference of the ancient and modern names of places is somewhat perplexing the most important should be known by both names at the same time and you must endeavour to fix a few of those which are of most consequence so strongly in your mind by thinking of them and being often told of them that the ancient name should always call up the modern one to your memory and the modern the ancient such as the ægean sea now the archipelagothe peloponnesus now the moreacrete candiagaul francebabylon bagdatbyzantiumto which the romans transplanted their seat of empireconstantinople c  there have been so many ingenious contrivances to make geography easy and amusing that i cannot hope to add any thing of much service i would only prevail with you not to neglect acquiring by whatever method pleases you best that share of knowledge in it which you will find necessary and which is so easily attained and i entreat that you would learn it in such a manner as to fix it in your mind so that it may not be lost and forgotten among other childish acquisitions but that it may remain ready for use through the rest of your life  chronology indeed has more of difficulty but if you do not bewilder yourself by attempting to learn too much and too minutely at first you need not despair of gaining enough for the purpose of reading history with pleasure and utility  chronology may be naturally divided into three parts the ancientthe middleand the modern with respect to all these the best direction that can be given is to fix on some periods or epochas which by being often mentioned and thought of explained and referred to will at last be so deeply engraven on the memory that they will be ready to present themselves whenever you call for them these indeed should be few and ought to be well chosen for their importance since they are to serve as elevated stations to the mind from which it may look backwards and forwards upon a great variety of facts  till your more learned friends shall supply you with better i will take the liberty to recommend the following which i have found of service to myself  in the ancient chronology you will find there were four thousand years from the creation to the redemption of man and that noah and his family were miraculously preserved in the ark    0 years after adams creation  as there is no history except that in the bible of any thing before the flood we may set out from that great event which happened as i have said above in the year of the world    0  the    0 years which passed from the deluge to our saviours birth may be thus dividedthere have been four successive empires called universal because they extended over a great part of the then known world these are usually distinguished by the name of the four great monarchies the three first of them are included in ancient chronology and began and ended in the following manner   st the assyrian empire founded by nimrod in the year of the world   00 ended under sardanapalus in    0 endured    0 years       the medianthough not accounted one of the four great      monarchies being conquests of rebels on the assyrian      empirecomes in here for about  00 years   d the persian empire which began under cyrus in the year of the world    0 ended in darius in    0 before christ   0 lasted a little more than  00 years   d the grecian empire began under alexander the great in    0 was soon after his death dismembered by his successors but the different parcels into which they divided it were possessed by their respective families till the famous cleopatra the last of the race of ptolemy one of alexanders captains who reigned in egypt was conquered by julius cæsar about half a century before our lords birth which is a term of about  00 years  thus you see that from the deluge to the establishment of the first great monarchythe                                        years     assyrianis                           0     the assyrian empire continued          0     the median                            00     the persian                           00     the grecian                           00     from julius cæsar with whom began       the fourth great monarchyviz       the romanto christ                 0                                                                        in all       0  years the term from the deluge to christ  i do not give you these dates and periods as correctly true for i have taken only round numbers as more easily retained by the memory so that when you come to consult chronological books or tables you will find variances of some years between them and the above accounts but precise exactness is not material to a beginner  i offer this short table as a little specimen of what you may easily do for yourself but even this sketch slight as it is will give you a general notion of the ancient history of the world from the deluge to the birth of christ  within this period flourished the grecian and roman republics with the history and chronology of which it will be expected you should be tolerably well acquainted and indeed you will find nothing in the records of mankind so entertaining greece was divided into many petty states whose various revolutions and annals you can never hope distinctly to remember you are therefore to consider them as forming together one great kingdomlike the germanic body or the united provincescomposed separately of different governments but sometimes acting with united force for their common interest the lacedemonian government formed by lycurgus in the year of the world   00and the athenian regulated by solon about the year    0will chiefly engage your attention  in pursuing the grecian chronology you need only perhaps make one stand or epocha at the time socrates that wisest of philosophers whom you must have heard of who lived about    0 years from the creation and about   0 before christ for within the term of   0 years before socrates and  00 after him will fall in most of the great events and illustrious characters of the grecian history  i must inform you that the grecian method of dating time was by olympiads that is four complete years so called from the celebration every fifty years of the olympic games which were contests in all the manly exercises such as wrestling boxing running chariotracing c they were instituted in honour of jupiter and took their name from olympia a city of elis near which they were performed they were attended by all ranks of people from every state in greece the noblest youths were eager to obtain the prize of victory which was no other than an olive crown but esteemed the most distinguishing ornament these games continued all the time that greece retained any spark of liberty and with them begins the authentic history of that countryall before being considered as fabulous you must therefore endeavour to remember that they began in the year of the world      after the flood    0 years after the destruction of troy  00 before the building of rome    before cyrus about  00 and   0 before christ if you cannot retain all these dates at least you must not fail to remember the near coincidence of the first olympiad with the building of rome which is of great consequence because as the grecians reckoned time by olympiads the romans dated from the building of their city and as these two eras are within    years of each other you may for the ease of memory suppose them to begin together in the year of the world       in reading the history of the roman republic which continued in that form of government to the time of julius cæsars dictatorship about the year of the world    0 and about    years before christ you will make as many epochas as you shall find convenient i will mention only two the sacking of rome by the gauls which happened in the year of the world    0 in the    th year of the city in the   th olympiad before christ     and about  0 years before the birth of alexander the second epocha may be the  0 th year of the city when after three obstinate wars carthage was destroyed and rome was left without a rival  perhaps the following bad verses which were given me when i was young may help to fix in your mind the important eras of the roman and grecian dates you must not laugh at them for chronologers do not pique themselves on their poetry but they make use of numbers and rhymes merely as assistants to memory being so easily learned by heart      rome and olympiads bear the same date     three thousand two hundred and twentyeight     in three hundred and sixty   was rome sackd and torn     thirty summers before alexander was born  you will allow that what i have said in these few pages is very easily learned yet little as it is i will venture to say that was you as perfectly mistress of it as of your alphabet you might answer several questions relating to ancient chronology more readily than many who pretend to know something of this science one is not so much required to tell the precise year in which a great man lived as to know with whom he was contemporary in other parts of the world i would know then from the slight sketch above given about what year of the roman republic alexander the great lived you would quickly run over in your mind alexander lived in the    0th year of the world   0 before christ consequently he must have flourished about the  00th of rome which had endured   0 years when christ was born or suppose it was asked what was the condition of greece at the time of the sacking of rome by the gauls had any particular state or the united body chosen then to take advantage of the misfortunes of the romans you consider that the    th year of the citythe date of that eventis     before christ consequently this must have happened about the time of philip of macedon father of alexander when the grecians under such a leader might have extirpated the roman nation from the earth had they ever heard of them or thought the conquest of them an object worthy their ambition  numberless questions might be answered in like manner even on this very narrow circumscribed plan if it was completely mastered i might require that other periods or epochas should be learned with the same exactness but these may serve to explain my meaning and to show you how practicable and easy it is one thing however i must observethough perhaps it is sufficiently obviouswhich is that you can make no use of this sketch of ancient chronology nor even hope to retain it till you have read the ancient history when you have gone through rollins histoire ancienne once then will be the time to fix the ancient chronology deep in your mind which will very much enhance the pleasure and use of reading it a second time for you must remember that nobody reads a history to much purpose who does not go over it more than once  when you have got through your course of ancient history and are come to the more modern you must then have recourse to the second of the three divisions viz middle chronology containing about  00 years from the birth of our lord and from within  0 years of the rise of the roman empire to charlemagne who died in      this period except in the earliest part of it is too much involved in obscurity to require a very minute knowledge of its history it may be sufficient to fix two or three of the most singular circumstances by their proper dates  the first epocha to be observed is the year of our lord   0 when constantine the first christian emperor who restored peace to the oppressed and persecuted church removed the seat of empire from rome to byzantium called afterwards from him constantinople after his time about the year  00 began those irruptions of the goths and vandals and other northern nations who settled themselves all over the western parts of the roman empire and laid the foundation of the several states which now subsist in europe  the next epocha is the year    for the ease of memory say  00when mahomet by his successful imposture became the founder of the saracen empire which his followers extended over a great part of asia and africa and over some provinces of europe at the same time st gregory bishop of rome began to assume a spiritual power which grew by degrees into that absolute and enormous dominion so long maintained by the popes over the greatest part of christendom st augustinea missionary from st gregoryabout this time began the conversion of great britain to christianity  the third and concluding epocha in this division is the year  00 when charlemagne king of franceafter having subdued the saxons repressed the saracens and established the temporal dominion of the pope by a grant of considerable territorieswas elected emperor of the west and protector of the church the date of this event corresponds with that remarkable period of our english historythe union of the heptarchy or seven kingdoms under egbert  as to the third part of chronology namely the modern i shall spare you and myself all trouble about at present for if you follow the course of reading which i shall recommend it will be some years before you reach modern history and when you do you will easily make periods for yourself if you do but remember carefully to examine the dates as you read and to impress on your memory those of very remarkable reigns or events  i fear you are by this time tired of chronology but my sole intention in what i have said is to convince you that it is a science not out of your reach in the moderate degree that is requisite for you the last volume of the ancient universal history is the best english chronological work i know if that does not come in your way there is an excellent french one called tablettes chronologiques de lhistoire universelle du fresnoy   tomes paris there is also a chart of universal history including chronology and a biographical chart both by priestley which you may find of service to you  indeed my dear a woman makes a poor figure who affects as i have heard some ladies do to disclaim all knowledge of times and dates the strange confusion they make of events which happened in different periods and the stare of ignorance when such are referred to as are commonly known are sufficiently pitiable but the highest mark of folly is to be proud of such ignorancea resource in which some of our sex find great consolation  adieu my dear child i am with the tenderest affection      ever yours  footnote     that is in the    th year of the city     letter x  on reading history       my dearest niece  when i recommend to you to gain some insight into the general history of the world perhaps you will think i propose a formidable task but your apprehensions will vanish when you consider that of near half the globe we have no histories at all that of other parts of it a few facts only are known to us and that even of those nations which make the greatest figure in history the early ages are involved in obscurity and fable it is not indeed allowable to be totally ignorant even of those fables because they are the frequent subjects of poetry and painting and are often referred to in more authentic histories  the first recorders of actions are generally poets in the historical songs of the bards are found the only accounts of the first ages of every state but in these we must naturally expect to find truth mixed with fiction and often disguised in allegory in such early times before science has enlightened the minds of men the people are ready to believe every thing and the historian having no restraints from the fear of contradiction or criticism delivers the most improbable and absurd tales as an account of the lives and actions of their forefathers thus the first heroes of every nation are gods or the sons of gods and every great event is accompanied with some supernatural agency homer whom i have already mentioned as a poet you will find the most agreeable historian of the early ages of greece and virgil will show you the supposed origin of the carthaginians and romans  it will be necessary for you to observe some regular plan in your historical studies which can never be pursued with advantage otherwise than in a continued series i do not mean to confine you solely to that kind of reading on the contrary i wish you frequently to relax with poetry or some other amusement whilst you are pursuing your course of history i only mean to warn you against mixing ancient history with modern or general histories of one place with particular reigns in another by which desultory manner of reading many people distract and confound their memories and retain nothing to any purpose from such a confused mass of materials  the most ancient of all histories you will read in your bible from thence you will proceed to lhistoire ancienne of rollin who very ingeniously points out the connection of profane with sacred history and enlivens his narrative with many agreeable and improving reflections and many very pleasing detached stories and anecdotes which may serve you as resting places in your journey it would be an useful exercise of your memory and judgment to recount these interesting passages to a friend either by letter or in conversation not in the words of the author but in your own natural styleby memory and not by book and to add whatever remarks may occur to you i need not say that you will please me much whenever you are disposed to make this use of me  the want of memory is a great discouragement in historical pursuits and is what every body complains of many artificial helps have been invented of which those who have tried them can best tell you the effects but the most natural and pleasant expedient is that of conversation with a friend who is acquainted with the history which you are reading by such conversations you will find out how much is usually retained of what is read and you will learn to select those characters and facts which are best worth preserving for it is by trying to remember every thing without distinction that young people are so apt to lose every trace of what they read by repeating to your friend what you can recollect you will fix it in your memory and if you should omit any striking particular which ought to be retained that friend will remind you of it and will direct your attention to it on a second perusal it is a good rule to cast your eye each day over what you read the day before and to look over the contents of every book when you have finished it  rollins work takes in a large compass but of all the ancient nations it treats of perhaps there are only the grecians and romans whose stories ought to be read with any anxious desire of retaining them perfectly for the rest such as the assyrians egyptians c i believe you would find on examination that most of those who are supposed tolerably well read in history remember no more than a few of the most remarkable facts and characters i tell you this to prevent your being discouraged on finding so little remain in your mind after reading these less interesting parts of ancient history  but when you come to the grecian and roman 0 stories i expect to find you deeply interested and highly entertained and of consequence eager to treasure up in your memory those heroic actions and exalted characters by which a young mind is naturally so much animated and impressed as greece and rome were distinguished as much for genius as valour and were the theatres not only of the greatest military actions the noblest efforts of liberty and patriotism but of the highest perfection of arts and sciences their immortal fame is a subject of wonder and emulation even to these distant ages and it is thought a shameful degree of ignorance even in our sex to be unacquainted with the nature and revolutions of their governments and with the characters and stories of their most illustrious heroes perhaps when you are told that the government and the national character of your own countrymen have been compared with those of the romans it may not be an useless amusement in reading the roman history to carry this observation in your mind and to examine how far the parallel holds good the french have been thought to resemble the athenians in their genius though not in their love of liberty these little hints sometimes serve to awaken reflection and attention in young readersi leave you to make what use of them you please  when you have got through rollin if you add vertots revolutions romainesa short and very entertaining workyou may be said to have read as much as is absolutely necessary of ancient history plutarchs lives of famous greeks and romansa book deservedly of the highest reputationcan never be read to so much advantage as immediately after the histories of greece and rome i should even prefer reading each life in plutarch immediately after the history of each particular hero as you meet with them in rollin or in vertot  if hereafter you should choose to enlarge your plan and should wish to know more of any particular people or period than you find in rollin the sources from which he drew may be open to you for there are i believe french or english translations of all the original historians from whom he extracted his materials  creviers continuation of rollin i believe gives the best account of the roman emperors down to constantine what shocking instances will you there meet with of the terrible effects of lawless power on the human mind how will you be amazed to see the most promising characters changed by flattery and selfindulgence into monsters that disgrace humanity to read a series of such lives as those of tiberius nero or domitian would be intolerable were we not consoled by the view of those excellent emperors who remained uncorrupted through all temptations when the minddisgusted depressed and terrifiedturns from the contemplation of those depths of vice to which human nature may be sunk a titus the delight of mankinda trajanan antoninusrestore it to an exulting sense of the dignity to which that nature may be exalted by virtue nothing is more awful than this consideration a human creature given up to vice is infinitely below the most abject brute the same creature trained by virtue to the utmost perfection of his nature is but a little lower than the angels and is crowned with glory and immortality  before you enter upon the modern history of any particular kingdom it will be proper to gain some idea of that interval between ancient and modern times which is justly called the dark and barbarous ages and which lasted from constantine to charlemagneperhaps one might say to some centuries after on the irruption of the northern barbarians who broke the roman empire and dissipated all the treasures of knowledge as well as of riches which had been so long accumulating in that enormous state the european world may be said to have returned to a second infancy and the monkish legends which are the only records preserved of the times in which they were written are not less fabulous than the tales of the demigods i must profess myself ignorant how to direct you to any distinct or amusing knowledge of the history of europe during this period   some collect it from puffendorfs introduction some from the universal history and now perhaps with more advantage and delight from the first volume of robertsons charles the fifth in which he traces the progress of civilization government and arts from the first settlements of the barbarians and shows the foundation of the several states into which europe is now divided and of those laws customs and politics which prevail in this quarter of the world  in those dark ages you will find no single character so interesting as that of mahomet that bold impostor who extended his usurped dominion equally over the minds and properties of men and propagated a new religion whilst he founded a new empire over a large portion of the globe his life has been written by various hands  when you come to the particular histories of the european states your own country seems to demand the precedence and there is no part more commodious to set out from since you cannot learn the history of great britain without becoming in some degree acquainted with almost every neighbouring nation and without finding your curiosity excited to know more of those with whom we are most connected  by the amazing progress of navigation and commerce within the last two or three centuries all parts of the world are now connected the most distant people are become well acquainted who for thousands of years never heard of one anothers existence we are still every day exploring new regions and every day see greater reason to expect that immense countries may yet be discovered and america no longer retain the name of the new world you may pass to every quarter of the earth and find yourself still in the british dominion this island in which we live is the least portion of it and if we were to adopt the style of ancient conquerors we might call it the throne from which we rule the world to this boast we are better entitled than some of those who formerly called themselves masters of the globe as we possess an empire of greater extent and from the superior advantages of our commerce much greater power and riches but we have now too many rivals in dominion to take upon us such haughty titles  you cannot be said to know the history of that empire of which you are a subject without knowing something of the east and west indies where so great a part of it is situated and you will find the accounts of the discovery and conquest of america very entertaining though you will be shocked at the injustice and cruelty of its conquerors but with which of the glorious conquerors of mankind must not humanity be shocked ambition the most remorseless of all passions pursues its object by all sorts of means justice mercy truth and every thing most sacred in vain oppose its progress alas my dear shall i venture to tell you that the history of the world is little else than a shocking account of the wickedness and folly of the ambitious the world has ever been and i suppose ever must be governed and insulted by these aspiring spirits it has always in greater or less degree groaned under their unjust usurpation  but let not the horror of such a scene put a stop to your curiosity it is proper you should know mankind as they are you must be acquainted with the heroes of the earth and perhaps you may be too well reconciled to them mankind have in general a strong bias in their favour we see them surrounded with pomp and splendourevery thing that relates to them has an air of grandeurand whilst we admire their natural powers we are too apt to pardon the detestable abuse of them to the injury and ruin of the human race we are dazzled with false glory and willingly give into the delusion for mighty conquests like great conflagrations have something of the sublime that pleases the imagination though we know if we reflect at all that the consequences of them are devastation and misery  the western and eastern world will present to you very different prospects in america the first european conquerors found nature in great simplicity society still in its infancy and consequently the arts and sciences yet unknown so that the facility with which they overpowered these poor innocent people was entirely owing to their superior knowledge in the arts of destroying they found the inhabitants brave enthusiastic patriots but without either the military or political arts necessary for their defence the two great kingdoms of mexico and peru had alone made some progress in civilization they were both formed into regular states and had gained some order and discipline from these therefore the spaniards met with something like an opposition at first indeed the invaders appeared supernatural beings who came upon them flying over the ocean on the wings of the wind and who mounted on fiery animals unknown in that country attacked them with thunder and lightning in their hands for such the firearms of the spaniards appeared to this astonished people but from being worshipped as gods they soon came to be feared as evil spirits and in time being discovered to be mendifferent from the americans only in their outrageous injustice and in the cruel arts of destroyingthey were abhorred and boldly opposed the resistance however of a million of these poor naked people desperately crowding on each other to destruction served only to make their ruin more complete the europeans have destroyed with the most shocking barbarity many millions of the original inhabitants of these countries and have ever since been depopulating europe and africa to supply their places  though our own countrymen have no reason to boast of the justice and humanity of their proceedings in america yet in comparison with those of the spaniards our possessions there were innocently acquired some of them gained by conquest or cession from spain and from other european powers some by contract with the natives or by settlements on uninhabited lands   we are now possessed of a series of colonies extending above two thousand miles along the whole eastern coast of northamerica besides many islands of immense value these countries instead of being thinly peopled by a few hordes of ignorant savages are now adorned with many great cities and innumerable rich plantations which have made ample returns to their mothercountry for the dangers and expenses which attended their first establishment blessed with more natural advantages than almost any country in the world they are making a swift progress in wealth and grandeur and seem likely in some future period to be as much the seat of empire and of science as europe is at present whether their attainments in virtue and happiness will keep pace with their advancement in knowledge wealth and power is much to be questioned for you will observe in your historical view of the several great empires of the world that as each grew up towards the highest pitch of greatness the seeds of destruction grew up with it luxury and vice by debasing the minds and enervating the bodies of the people left them all in their turns an easy prey to poorer and more valiant nations  in the east the europeans introduced themselves in a milder way admitted first as tradersand for the more commodious carrying on their commerce indulged by the powers of the country in establishing a few small factoriesthey by gentle degrees extended and strengthened their settlements there till their force became considerable enough to be thought an useful auxiliary to contending princes and as it has often happened to those who have called in foreign powers to interfere in their domestic contentions by availing themselves of the disturbances of a dismembered monarchy they at length raised a power almost independent of their employers soon the several european nations who had thus got footing in the indies jealous of each others growing greatness made the feuds of the native princes subservient to their mutual contests till within a few years the english by a happy concurrence of circumstances obtained the mastery and expelled their rivals from all their considerable settlements  the rapidity of our conquests here has been perhaps equal to that of the first invaders of americabut from different causes here we found an oldestablished empire advanced to its crisis the magnificence and luxury of the great carried to the highest excess and the people in a proportionable degree of oppression and debasement thus ripe for destruction the rivalship of the viceroys from the weakness of the government become independent sovereigns and the dastardly spirit of the meaner people indifferent to the cause for which they were compelled to fight encouraged these ambitious merchants to push their advantages further than they could at first have supposed possible with astonishment they saw the intrepid leaders of a few hundreds of brave free britons boldly oppose and repeatedly put to flight millions of these effeminate indian slaves and in a short time raised for them an empire much larger than their mothercountry  from these remote quarters of the world let us now return to great britain with the history of which you ought certainly to acquaint yourself before you enter upon that of any other european kingdom if you have courage and industry enough to begin so high as the invasion of julius cæsarbefore which nothing is known of the inhabitants of this islandyou may set out with rapin and proceed with him to william the conqueror from this era there are other histories of england more entertaining than his though i believe none esteemed more authentic party so strongly influences both historians and their readers that it is a difficult and invidious task to point out the best amongst the number of english histories that offer themselves but as you will not read with a critical view nor enter deeply into politics i think you may be allowed to choose that which is most entertaining and in this view i believe the general voice will direct you to hume though he goes no further than the revolution among other historians do not forget my darling shakspearea faithful as well as a most agreeable onewhose historical plays if read in a series will fix in your memory the reigns he has chosen more durable than any other history you need not fear his leading you into any material mistakes for he keeps surprisingly close to the truth as well in the characters as in the events one cannot but wish he had given us a play on the reign of every english king as it would have been the pleasantest and perhaps the most useful way of becoming acquainted with it  for the other portion of great britain robertsons history of scotland is a delightful work and of a moderate size  next to your own country france will be the most interesting object of your inquiries our ancient possessions in that country and the frequent contests we have been engaged in with its inhabitants connect their history with our own the extent of their dominion and influencetheir supposed superiority in elegance and politenesstheir eminence in the arts and sciencesand that intercourse of thought if so i may call it which subsists between us by the mutual communication of literary productionsmake them peculiarly interesting to us and we cannot but find our curiosity excited to know their story and to be intimately acquainted with the character genius and sentiments of this nation  i do not know of any general history of france that will answer your purpose except that of mezerai which even in the abridgment is a pretty large work there is a very modern one by velly and others which perhaps may be more lively but is still more voluminous and not yet completed from mezerai you may proceed with voltaire to the end of the reign of louis the fourteenth  in considering the rest of europe your curiosity may be confined within narrower limits modern history is from the nature of it much more minute and laborious than the ancient and to pursue that of so many various kingdoms and governments would be a task unequal to your leisure and abilities at least for several years to come at the same time it must be owned that the present system of politics and commerce has formed such a relation between the different powers of europe that they are in a manner members of one great body and a total ignorance of any considerable state would throw an obscurity even upon the affairs of your own country   an acquaintance however with the most remarkable circumstances that distinguish the principal governments will sufficiently enlighten you and will enable you to comprehend whatever relates to them in the histories with which you are more familiar instead of referring you for this purpose to dull and uninteresting abridgments i choose rather to point out to you a few small tracts which exhibit striking and lively pictures not easily effaced from the memory of the constitutions and the most remarkable transactions of several of these nations such are       sir william temples essay on the united provinces       his essay on heroic virtue which contains some account of      the saracen empire       vertots revolutions de suede       vertots revolutions de portugal       voltaires charles xii de suede       voltaires pierre le grand       puffendorfs account of the popes in his introduction to      modern history  some part of the history of germany and spain you will see more in detail in robertsons history of charles the vth which i have already recommended to you in another view  after all this you may still be at a loss for the transactions of europe in the last fifty years for the purpose of giving you in a very small compass some idea of the state of affairs during that period i will venture to recommend one book morecampbells state of europe    thus much may suffice for that moderate scheme which i think is best suited to your sex and age there are several excellent histories and memoirs of particular reigns and periods which i have taken no notice of in this circumscribed plan but with which if you should happen to have a taste for the study you will hereafter choose to be acquainted these will be read with most advantage after you have gained some general view of history and they will then serve to refresh your memory and settle your ideas distinctly as well as enable you to compare different accounts of the persons and facts which they treat of and to form your opinions of them on just grounds  as i cannot with certainty foresee what degree of application or genius for such pursuits you will be mistress of i shall leave deficiencies of this collection to be supplied by the suggestions of your more informed friends who if you explain to them how far you wish to extend your knowledge will direct you to the proper books  but if instead of an eager desire for this kind of knowledge you should happen to feel that distaste for it which is too common in young ladies who have been indulged in reading only works of mere amusement you will perhaps rather think that i want mercy in offering you so large a plan than that there needs an apology for the deficiencies of it but comfort yourself with the assurance that a taste for history will grow and improve by reading that as you get acquainted with one period or nation your curiosity cannot fail to be awakened for what concerns those immediately connected with it and thus you will insensibly be led on from one degree of knowledge to another  if you waste in trivial amusement the next three or four years of your life which are the prime season of improvement believe me you will hereafter bitterly regret their loss when you come to feel yourself inferior in knowledge to almost every one you converse withand above all if you should ever be a mother when you feel your own inability to direct and assist the pursuits of your childrenyou will then find ignorance a severe mortification and a real evil let this my dear animate your industry and let not a modest opinion of your own capacity be a discouragement to your endeavours after knowledge a moderate understanding with diligent and welldirected application will go much further than a more lively genius if attended with that impatience and inattention which too often accompanies quick parts it is not from want of capacity that so many women are such trifling insipid companions so ill qualified for the friendship and conversation of a sensible man or for the task of governing and instructing a family it is much oftener from the neglect of exercising the talents which they really have and from omitting to cultivate a taste for intellectual improvement by this neglect they lose the sincerest of pleasures a pleasure which would remain when almost every other forsakes them which neither fortune nor age can deprive them of and which would be a comfort and resource in almost every possible situation of life  if i can but inspire you my dear child with the desire of making the most of your time and abilities my end is answered the means of knowledge will easily be found by those who diligently seek them and they will find their labours abundantly rewarded                                       and now my dear i think it is time to finish this long correspondence which
