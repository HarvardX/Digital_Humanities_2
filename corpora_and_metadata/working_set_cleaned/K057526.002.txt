the history of jack connor now conyers  volume ii  the second edition corrected  but not to treat my subject as in jest yet may not truth in laughing guise be dressed as masters fondly sooth the boys to read with cakes and sweetmeats let us now proceed with graver air our serious theme pursue and yet preserve our moral full in view franciss horace london printed for w johnston at the golden ball in st pauls churchyard  mdccliii  the history of jack connor now conyers chap i he parted frowning from me as if ruin leaped from his eyes shakespeare some few days passed in the common way when mr sangfroid entered and with pleasure told conyers he had provided him a good place  my lord bishop of  said he wants just such an one as you to transcribe his works and keep some accounts  conyers without hesitation accepted the offer and next morning was presented to the bishop and immediately entered on his office  his lordship was a great writer but his works were intended for the use of posterity having never published but a thanksgiving sermon and one on the  0th of january by order of the house of lords his tracts were very voluminous but all essential and of the utmost consequence to mankind his treatise on the use and abuse of surplices and lawn sleeves was filled with the profoundest erudition  his discourse on pews cushions and mats in churches was extremely well handled but the postscript on the crime of sleeping in those places was so artfully worded that you felt an example in yourself  his letter to the inhabitants of the parish of  clearly demonstrated the absurdity of a steeple without bells  his apology and vindication of murder adultery and fornication proving mathematically that the nature and name of these crimes were entirely changed by circumstance time and place was a most learned and elaborate performance but his favorite work was his history and doctrine of tithes which he demonstrated to be an essential of true religion  his lordship at different times was so good as fully to explain these subjects to conyers who in three months had transcribed the treatise on surplices and had just began the lastmentioned work he had full employment but was not extremely pleased with the nature of it for his taste was so vitiated that he found no charms in what he did not understand  the bishop kept a plentiful table where his clergy were welcome except the poorer sort to whom he made ample amends for the distinction by small presents and large promises he was a man of virtue and religiously kept his word when his memory which was none of the best failed him not so weak was he in that quarter that he remembered and forgot his promise to a poor curate ten different times and as often was angry with himself on these occasions he used to say well god help me i find i am grown old my faculties cannot last for ever  the lord gave and the lord takes away  sometimes indeed his memory was very sharp for if one or ten of his clergy were sick he never failed a daily enquiry after their health and when any died he never suffered the living to lapse he could not bear contradiction and no doubt his dependants were careful not to offend in that article  he did not like money but he passionately loved it  jack did not much approve of his situation he lived well but he plainly saw he had no great prospect of a future fortune and looked on himself as gil blas when with the archbishop which determined him to be soon convinced of what he had to depend on he had thoughts of writing a modest and moving letter to his lordship but then he remembered that  a verse may catch him who a sermon flies so resolved to write a stanza or two and leave it on my lords desk next morning accordingly he sat down and wrote though every virtue fills my heart though modesty oerspreads my face what are their worth except some art can raise these virtues into place yet though i cannot myself commend kind fate may still relieve my want and as dull sermons always end heaven of it is gracious mercy grant   my lord mounted to his study as usual and found the scrowl which he carefully read and as carefully put into his pocket  family prayers and breakfast being ended jack was ordered to attend him  good morrow mr conyers said his lordship i am extremely concerned that my understanding did not discover your worth and genius before this morning they are so uncommon they ought to be rewarded  jack applauded himself for his lucky thought but my lord proceeded  i have a paper in my hand on which you will permit my making a few remarks i believe it is intended for poetry which at the best is an idle unprofitable study i shall not speak of the rhyme but of the subject  your first line is false for as you want prudence you cannot have every virtue  your second is not fact for i never saw you blush in my life  oh  i ask your pardon you blush now indeed  as to the worth of your virtues and modesty i am afraid you will find it of little or no value and your art must be extraordinary if you think to impose on me  but it seems you want a place  i shall soon put you into the highroad to preferment  your second stanza is most admirable  you cannot praise yourself poor gentleman although you tell us of your virtue and modesty  this indeed is the height of modesty then like a true heathen you believe in fate  if so pray mr john take care of your fate  here you complain bitterly of want can any man be said to want who has three good meals a day  now comes the best of all  you are one of those fine gentlemen who cannot play the fool but they must bring in the church you abuse sermons  who make sermons but the clergy  and the clergy make the church these matters mr john ought to be held in reverence by all men much more by such as you  i most humbly beseech your lordship said jack to   pray sir spare me said my lord for i have but a few words more to say  you were so good as to give me a bit of poetry and in return permit me to give you a bit of prose  he then rung his bell and giving him a paper proceeded  here is mr john conyers some of my own composition and to show you it is of some value pray tack these ten guineas to it  so now mr john conyers you are a freeman and have my consent to get what place you please  my lords gentleman then entered the chamber  lewis said my lord here is mr john who has given me such a lecture on his modesty that convinces me is the most impudent fellow breathing so bid the porter open the door and let him out such modesty ought to be seen in the world  jack was extremely mortified and attempted to speak but lewis shouldered him out of the room finding he could have no remedy he bundled up his little effects quitted the house and soon visited mr sangfroid to whom he told his story  this accident said his friend gives me little concern for i believe his lordship would never have provided for you as you deserve but if you will wear a livery i can get you into sir peter shallows service tomorrow he is a member of parliament and perhaps in time may procure you an employment  it is worth the trial said conyers and a livery shall be no objection  next day jack attended sir peter and received the badge of office but by the advice of his friend he took the name of constant  chap ii there affectation with a sickly mein shows in her cheeks the roses of eighteen practiced to lisp and hang the head aside faints into airs and languishes with pride on the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe wrapped in a gown for sickness and for show the fairones feel such maladies as these when each new nightdress gives a new disease popes rape of the lock sir peter shallow was a gentleman of large fortune but more remarkable for his easy quiet temper than strong judgment his lady had somewhat of the opposite character and as her understanding informed her sir peter had but a small share she took the accustomed privilege of sometimes imposing on it and indeed his great fondness gave her frequent opportunities  her ladyship had a very delicate constitution and was afflicted with the spleen and vapors to such a degree that she has sometimes been silent for ten minutes then has burst out into lamentations and tears then into violent laughter and end in a swoon  doctor nostrum constantly attended but one evening when he had finished above sir john got him to taste some cape wine and give some account of her ladyships disorder  sir john said the doctor who was a dry joker here is my service to you  upon my word very good wine  very good wine indeed sir but  you were saying something of that there disorder  why  to be sure your hypochondriac and hysteric disorders are troublesome  very troublesome and tedious but seem i may say to be more so to the husband or wife or attendants than to the patient and physician i think i have had these disorders in a peculiar manner under my care for these thirty or thirtytwo years last past and i think i may say that i understand them that is i know how to treat them properly  there is no certain rule to go by for  for as a skilful mariner must find out the trim of his ship so i say a skilful physician must find out the temper of his patient  if i prescribe a china jarr when the malady is fixed on a japan cabinet i shall do wrong  be all out and perchance may double the disorder upon me  i own doctor said sir peter i am no judge of these matters but for my blood i cannot conceive what jarrs or cabinets have to do in the affair  o lord sir peter cried the doctor  but here is my best respects  in truth it has a charming flavor  but as you were saying  or  as i was saying  to explain this phoenomenon i shall not call in the ancients for they were ignorant very ignorant of sundry modern ailments but account that is reason upon them on the principles of the modern philosophy  hem  hem  the disorder is of the feminine gender  when it attacks a masculine figure it then becomes of the doubtful  it is termed by preeminence vapor from its ascending quality for it rises you will please to observe sir in the heart by the too quick viberation of the blood and mounts directly to the brain  thus  when an object is placed before a lady in such a point of light that the rays of her eyes center and form a focus upon it the effect is surprising  the object indeed remains sound and entire but her heart burns for it  when the heart strings are untuned no wonder that the voice is all discord  a diamond solitair  a gilt chariot  fine dresden china  an indian skreen  and the like cause such a fluttering of the animal spirits and raise such a longing for possessing them that clearly demonstrates sir isaacs doctrine of attraction and vision  contrary principles will sometimes produce the same dreadful effects  when a lady delights in the innocent amusement of play and has what they call an ill run it undoubtedly will overheat the blood and sour the temper  but i say  when she is not in a condition to discharge such honorable debts the whole mass is on a ferment and frequently produces consequences very fatal to the repose of the family  would to heaven said sir peter it was the case of my dear creature i then could soon apply the remedy  why truly sir peter replied the doctor two or three hundred guineas make wonderful alterations i would advise you sir peter to see how my prescriptions will operate for a day or two  if the disorder dont take a turn in that time why apply yours  but here is my good ladys better health  i profess it is a most delicious cordial  it warms my heart  i fancy doctor said sir peter this wine would be very proper for my dear girl  it would raise her spirits  raise her spirits cried the doctor why it is their being too high that causes the disorder  besides  besides  all dulciferous fluids are bad  acid is her proper regimen and though it is true there is an acidity in all sweets it is not of the right sort  your right genuine sour is the surest remedy  i have ordered the juice of the crab apple to be taken internally and the fungous matter to be applied plaisterways to the shoulders and back with great success  i was once sent for to a rich carpenters in southwark whose wife was suddenly seized with the vapors  the poor woman was as extremely ill as any lady of the first quality  so sir  as i was saying  i was going to order her the apples but the season not affording any and her case being very desperate i directed her husband to take a slender twig of that there tree of about three foot long and apply the same in so smart a manner to the shoulders that the part might be thoroughly warmed and the pores so opened as at once to draw and suffer the malignant effluvia to evaporate with ease  next morning sir i visited my patient but to my very great surprise i found her cheerfully sitting by the kitchen fire darning her husbands stockings  the fellow was an ungrateful dog  for he never employed me since  i shall not sir peter take up more of your time at present but refer you to a small folio on that subject which i have now ready for the press  this one glass and no more  amongst a variety of observations one is pretty general  in all the practice and experience i have had i never knew a lady subject to spleen or vapors who was blessed with a surly illnatured husband  in russia the disorder is unknown otherwise the great klincosky and the celebrated baroniwisky would have taken some notice of it but you frequently meet with the use and efficacy of the crab tree and find it in most of their prescriptions which perhaps is given by way of prevention  but my hour is come for a consultation  so  sir peter your most obedient and most faithful humble servant   poor sir peter was greatly edified by the doctors learned dissertation but had not judgment enough to take his advice for with the impatience of a lover he flew to my ladys apartment and finding her somewhat composed though extremely feeble he ventured to mention that perhaps she might want some little necessaries he was unacquainted of and entreated her acceptance of three hundred guineas  he threw the money on the table but it was astonishing to observe how quickly the remedy operated  her face glowed vermillion spread her cheeks she smiled heavenly and at last most tenderly embracing her dear sir peter she sunk into his arms and every symptom of the malady vanished  chap iii for as a pythagorean soul runs through all beasts and fish and fowl and has a smack of every one so love does and has ever done and therefore though it is never so fond takes strangely to the vagabond it is but an ague that is reverst whose hotfit takes the patient first that after burns with cold as much as ice in greenland does the touch hudibras the servants had persuaded jack to be a member and pay quarteridge to a society of footmen which they called a parliament this convocation regulated diverse weighty matters and raised a fund for the maintenance of their brethren out of place the members took the titles of their respective masters and spoke and acted so near their characters that it might be termed a saturnalia jack was but too punctual a visiter if he improved not in his manners by such company he thought at least that he was well diverted  the constitution of this motly synod with their conduct and resolutions must be postponed to another chapter that the chain of this history may not be broken  was our hero entitled to an estate his age would permit him to enjoy it  his complexion his manner his voice but above all his generous goodhumoured disposition could not escape the piercing eyes of mrs susanna pinup this lady acted in the humble station of waiting woman to lady shallow from her knowledge of sundry domestic secrets she had great power in the family and as the servants phrase it had feathered her nest her great sagacity not only discovered charms in the person of mr john constant but that he had money likewise the union of such perfections merited her tenderest regard to which she thought if her own were added the system of happiness would be complete  with these views mrs pinup began to notice our jack in a particular manner she showed him every civility she honored him frequently with her conversation and was so intimate and gracious that he often drank tea in her chamber such a manifest partiality drew on her the resentment and scandalous tongues of the other servants but from her exalted seat she looked down with contempt on the vulgar wretches  mr buffett the butler seemed most concerned and with a jaundicd eye beheld this growing passion so fatal to his hopes this gentleman had long sighed for mrs pinup and made sundry libations of pints of sack and other choice wines on the shrine of her beauty his project was as extensive as it was ambitious he judged that could he obtain the heart of this lady the cheating the family in every branch from the cellar upwards would center in his own pocket this was a loss his philosophy was not proof against and made him meditate dire revenge  mrs pinup was so fond of jack and so secure of her darling scheme that she omitted some essentials in bringing it to bear for one evening when protestations and vows were plentifully bestowed on each other and fervent kisses and embraces given and returned with mutual ardour the world and all its idle ceremonies were forgotten and equal happiness cemented their hearts without the assistance of any priest except that of love  matters were thus conducted for some time but mrs pinup had praised jack so much to miss shallow that she longed to converse with him and pinups chamber gave her frequent opportunities miss shallow was sister to sir peter and had a fortune of ten thousand pounds her education had been none of the best and her person was of that sort that a man passes by without noticing however jacks vanity was strangely up and ten thousand pounds put a million of schemes into his head and his waking and sleeping dreams were filled with equipage and splendour  with some difficulty and weighty reasons he persuaded pinup to assist him and miss shallow seemed noways averse to his caresses and proposal though the was actually engaged to squire hunt and the marriage writings drawn in short nothing was wanting to complete this affair but a convenient opportunity which would soon have happened had not adverse fate in the shape of mr buffett maliciously interposed  jealousy envy interest and revenge are powerful separate but make strange havoc when united buffett had them all he had never ceased watching the motions of mrs pinup and his discoveries were such that they added to his pain but when he found miss shallow was of the party revenge opened an ample field  sir peter as i have before observed was not the brightest genius in england but in recompense nature had indulged him with a large share of pride that vice of little minds with which he sometimes imposed himself on the world as a man of consequence and great importance  mr buffett knew his ruling passion and applied to it on the first notice the knight stormed and swelled with rage but the butler moderated his anger and persuaded him into patience until he should convince him of the truth  next evening the lovers met but the artful buffett had so contrived that sir peter abruptly entered and caught the unguarded pair in their innocent embraces and mrs pinup in the midst of a discourse on constancy  fine doings in my house cried sir peter  but i will spoil your sport you impudent son of a w  re  he ran directly at jack but love and miss shallow averted the blow and gave him an opportunity of slipping out of the room his retreat was so precipitate that he did not observe the butler listening on the stairhead but drove against his breast with such force that poor mr buffett was hurried down a little improperly for his head went foremost he fell with a mighty noise and the alarm was general through the family  had there been earth or airquakes in those days no doubt they had all ran to prayers and laughed at themselves for so doing when the danger was over  sir peter thundered  miss screamed and pinup wept so loud that my lady with her company and almost all the servants filled the room in an instant  the knight thought he acted very cunningly by not telling the whole of this affair before so many but as he dropped some words about miss and insisted that pinup and jack should be immediately discharged he left them all room enough to think the worst though perhaps their charity and goodnature wanted not his help  my lady pleaded strongly for poor pinup yet at last she was obliged to consent but with a proviso that the butler should make a third sir peter gave him up very readily so that in less than an hour the illfated mr buffett lost his cellar  the unhappy pinup lost all her lovers promises  the unfortunate jack lost ten thousand pounds and  next day miss shallow lost her reputation but luckily she found it on the third in the arms of squire hunt  i forgot to mention that mr sangfroid had been lately obliged to accompany a nobleman to lisbon so that jack lost this asylum with his advice and friendship  when he had packed up his goods and resigned his livery he found mrs pinup waiting for him in the hall because as she said one coach might serve both  they mounted but where to drive was not determined but at last they stopped in southamptonstreet jack alighted and soon found a convenient lodging where the happy pair acted the part of man and wife with great harmony for about a fortnight pinup often boasted her riches and tempted him by showing thirty guineas in hard gold besides linens and woollens and sundry gowns and petticoats  jack was proof against all tears and entreaties  psha said he i have more than that myself marry  we should be pretty devils truly no no child keep your money and i will keep your secret  i dont understand said she what you mean by secrets  if i have any i believe it will not be a secret long  i wish your money was no more a secret than mine  so much for secrets replied jack now for the proof do you see that large trunk my dear it is the faithful repository of fifty guineas ay ay said she i see both your trunks but for the money seeings believing you have no more faith cried jack than an ebrew jew but i shall convince you in a moment  the large trunk had not been opened by him these six months and he found the lock rusty and more difficult than it used to be at last he got the better but was surprised at seeing some of his effects out of order in a little flutter he searched for his purse but not readily finding it his hurry increased and he pulled out an old great coat and some tattered shirts artfully mingled with some of his things of little value  in a word his money and his best effects were vanished  he flew in an instant to the small trunk which contained his ordinary wear and in which he had very oddly placed the small box his old friend mr kindly had given him and most of mr villeneufs and his own papers finding this safe and untouched he sat down in silence though greatly perplexed  bless me said mrs pinup what ails the man  sure you havent lost your money  yes said jack it is gone  every shilling gone but how or which way heaven knows  heaven knows said she i believe heaven knows very well you had no such thing but that you have betrayed and cheated a poor innocent woman but since i find these are your tricks i shall take care of myself i assure you  very well replied jack pray proceed for i am in a temper to provoke a saint for i shant answer  as she had nothing to fear she saluted him with bitter terms and many stinging reproaches till tears intervened and gave him a recess  since said he you are so good to be silent because you have no more to say pray let me be heard  i have my quarters wages in my pocket which will more than pay the lodging let me have a little repose this night and tomorrow you may dispose of yourself how and which way you please for by the lord this shall be the last  pinup attempted a reply but he swore in so peremptory a manner as frightened the poor woman into silence they retired to bed but love and repose had forsaken it and hatred and disquietude took their place the dawning day roused jack from his pillow and pinup unwillingly followed he generously paid all charges and putting his trunks on a bier parted with this lady telling her before the landlady that she might follow at her leisure but as he intended so he never saw her after  chap iv example is a living law whose sway men more than all the written laws obey sedley as the dropping water will in time impress even marble so low and mean company will communicate their sentiments and infect even an heart of understanding and virtue jack now ceased to be the agreeable and the polite he swore much and sometimes drank he had contracted a saucy impertinent air and instead of that humble modest deportment that drew on him the love and esteem of the world his looks and actions seemed to demand them as his right and as due to his person and superior merit he forgot all the lessons and instructions of his friends and thought his own experience and great knowledge were sufficient to conduct him without the assistance of pedantick rules or the musty gravity of old philosophers  however this last stroke of fortune had altered his thermometer and pride sunk down to extreme humility in this temper he applied to mr edge a barber to whom he made known his situation honest edge was sorry to find him in such distress and provided him a room for two shillings a week but for his diet he was to manage the best way he could he had still three guineas and some silver remaining and waited with great anxiety for a turn of fortune  as our hero like other heroes has found a time for idleness and inaction it furnishes me an opportunity of examining the memoirs of the parliament of footmen and making such extracts as i judge of public use and benefit  this noble order held their assemblies at sundry beerhouses but all united in the main view of giving laws to and providing a maintenance for the brethren who came within their rules the chamber our friend frequented was filled with the servants of dukes lords bishops knights and squires and made up a subscribing body of about two hundred of which forty or fifty were commonly present at each weekly assembly as these great men followed the example of their great superiors they were less clamorous than might be expected an old gentleman filled the chair as speaker and kept matters in most excellent order  the following are a few of their principal resolutions for by the advice of friends i shall speedily publish by subscription a full and impartial history of this noble order in seven volumes octavo in which will be included all their speeches on the most interesting subjects and a complete system of wisdom and prudence the resolutions necessary in this place are as follow  resolved that each member when out of place shall receive two shillings each week for the term of six months but no longer on his getting a new livery to pay fresh entrance  resolved that each member

shall be seized upon and kept in safe custody until the said gentlemen depart should any of the said gentlemen refuse or neglect to pay the usual compliment it shall and may be lawful to change his said hat etc or have them mislaid or lost and as occasion serves to give him water when he calls for wine small beer when he desires bread and if he be an obstinate offender entirely to disregard and affront him  resolved that as we look on the tables of our masters as ordinaries so we expect to be paid in proportion to their rank from half a crown to half a guinea  resolved that no persons paying a morning visit to our respective masters and particularly tradespeople with bills shall be permitted to see them except on payment of the usual and accustomed fee but on their compliance then our said masters to be made visible notwithstanding any orders to the contrary  resolved that all tradesmen shall be obliged to pay at the rate of five pounds by the hundred for every commodity sold to our respective masters and the said tradesmen are hereby empowered to make an extraordinary charge of ten pounds by the hundred  resolved that in attending our masters or mistresses to the playhouse

dignity of our cloth that should any member of this society marry the relict of his master or the daughter of his master or mistress that he shall pay into the hands of our treasurer ten shillings for every hundred pounds obtained by such marriage  resolved that any member guilty of robbery or theft shall be expelled this society nevertheless this is not understood to extend to breach of trust embezzlement of goods and the necessary frauds in bread coals candles oats etc which we regard as privileges annexed to our posts and part of our just perquisites  resolved that each member be as careful as possible of all his apparel except the livery and that he practices all lawful ways and means to wear out his masters shirts shoes stockings etc  they had many more equally wholesome laws not made like some others to be broken or despised for i apprehend they kept strictly to each  chap v endure and conquer jove will soon dispose to future good our past and present woes an hour will come with pleasure to relate your sorrows past as benefits of fate drydens virgil jack remained at the barbers about three weeks and though he received his parliamentary pension very punctually yet his money diminished apace  he saw no appearance of advancement and gloomy melancholy thoughts racked his brain with a view of alleviating his sorrows he frequently took a dram and innocently amused himself with one or two very low amors this made his purse feel a very sensible decay for it now contained but a very few shillings  mad and wild at the cruelty of his fate a thousand projects filled his head and at last ended in the noble resolution of spending the little he had in pleasure and then to resign a life that became burdensome to him he brought many weighty reasons to vindicate the action and called to his mind the example of sundry great men who accounted it meritorious  why are we said he brought into the world but to enjoy the few pleasures of it with ease and content  what ease have i  what content  if the reasons of being cease it is but just we should cease to be  besides what are all the pleasures of this world even in the highest gratification but idle stupid repetitions of the same stupid amusements  come gentle thames and peaceful grave now come for conyers is aweary of this world and longs to lay his troubled head in dust  he was now in st jamess park his steps were slow his arms were folded his head reclined and a fixed melancholy was seated on his brow  in the midst of these reflections two of his quondam brethren passed him by but one turning about cried  z  ns jack constant  such a man alive where the devil have you hid yourself these thousand years  these sort of greetings finished they entered into particulars i suppose said tom smart you are now one of those poor dastardly scoundrels who starve in a rich world  let him starve cried jack brazen if he has not spirit enough to fish in troubled waters come come said smart do you really want money  not much replied our friend for i believe i have a shilling but where to get another the lord knows  heres a guinea my boy said smart you see i dont want money nor need you if you will take our advice but let us dine together and talk that matter over  they dined and a bottle of port was opened as well as the conversation smart dwelt long on the partial distribution of the good things of this world and on the necessity of correcting the scheme  is it just said he that numbers of goodfornothing worthless animals shall wallow in plenty and abundance whilst such young fellows as us may want the common conveniences of life  very just said brazen provided they will permit our using some of their superfluities  d  me said jack but i am all in the dark i wish you would speak a little plainer or not speak at all you may depend on my secrecy for i am almost already in the grave now gentlemen if you have a mind to bring me to life come to the point directly and a thousand to one but i will join in your scheme  well said honest jack cried smart then to the point  you must know that brazen and i were turned adrift together from my lords we wore out our shoes and the pavement but could get no employment and something told us that eating was necessary so my dear constant we padded it about the fields for some time and by our industry have risen to horse we are at this time commissioners of the highways and collect those duties omitted in the acts of parliament  i understand you said jack but does it answer is it not dangerous  it answers said smart extremely well though to be sure it is a little hazardous but where is the employment without it  dont the merchant venture for lucre and the soldier and sailor risk their lives for sixpence a day  some risk their reputation and most people risk their souls  believe me jack the whole world is a game of hazard and showing his pistols here are my dice  will you set  our hero paused and a violent conflict arose in his breast between virtue and necessity  at last brazen clapped him on the shoulder and cried  what says my dear boy  will you make a third and then our party is complete  gentlemen said jack give me your hands now i am a brother  command and lead me where you please  that night they conducted him to their lodging and gave him a horse for the morning expedition and three guineas more they rose very early and jack put on a pair of spatterdashes examined his saddle and pistols and found all things in tolerable order  the plan of operation was settled by smart but providentially jack made a small alteration no gentlemen said he let us not set out together or keep company on the road as it may cause suspicion let us rather divide and ride on to stains but join on hounslowheath precisely at eleven oclock when we cannot fail of meeting the coach we look for  besides when separate we may each pick up a single traveller to amuse us before the principal action  very right said smart then i will advance first brazen will follow in half an hour and you will bring up the rear in another so gentlemen good morrow success attend us  he rode off and brazen but rested his proper time  when alone jack began to consider this affair more circumspectly but not with a design of breaking his engagement the fellow who took care of the horses was no stranger to the expedition and congratulated his new master on the prospect of making his fortune tim said jack i have a thought that will surprise my friends if you will assist me i will give your a crown for your trouble  that i will master answered tim and be true and faithful too  well then said jack take my horse and ride a little beyond the church at hounslow and wait for me you may depend i shall not keep you long when you deliver me the horse go directly across the heath  tim promised to obey his orders and set forwards  two odd circumstances happened to jack he very fortunately knew the name of a family that lived just by hounslow of which he intended to make a proper use and the old great coat which he found in his trunk he had made into a surtout and was then on his back this coat was of that sort of cloth that is one side scarlet and the other blue it was single and not lined this day the blue was outside and the sleeves turned up made scarlet cuffs thus dressed he walked to piccadilly and took a postchaise to hounslow where he arrived at ten oclock with great civility he enquired of mrs day about the family he said he was going to visit he called for a gill of wine and the good woman answered all his questions which were such as made her imagine he was a relation of the family and had just come from abroad he hinted that perhaps he might stay there a week or return in an hour when he would be glad of a postchaise ready for london mrs day assuring him he should have one at a moments warning he walked forward though with a troubled mind and soon found his horse when tim had marched off he turned his surtout and was now in scarlet with blue sleeves  he rode on about three miles and met with his friends who began to be in some pain about him  z  ds said smart what the devil kept you so long  but we have no time to talk for the coach is at hand you are to keep the postillion and coachman in awe brazen will do the same with the servants and let me alone for conversing with the passengers when the jobbs over let us separate and meet at our lodging  they had no time for further deliberation for the coach drew near  courage cried smart and all rode briskly forward  jack did his duty with the postillion  the servants making a resistance received a fire from brazen which did no harm but the compliment was instantly returned and poor brazen fell from his horse whilst this was doing smart attacked the coach but a gentleman in it with great resolution so nimbly and with such strength turned his wrist that the pistol went off in the air and immediately one of the servants rode up and knocked him down  jack finding two wings of his army taken prisoners was determined to save the remainder by a speedy flight the gentlemen and servants were so busy about smart and brazen that he was not pursued but got near hounslow in a short time  his former caution had now its use for tying his horse to a tree a little out of the road he once more turned his coat and walked leisurely on to the inn with a tolerable coolness of temper he desired a postchaise but accidentally a horse was wanting which obliged him to wait a full half hour which no doubt he thought was half an age he summoned all his resolution to avoid suspicion and talked to mrs day about the family he had visited his chaise was just ready when mr day entered  there now said he is two fine gentlemen that have made a noble kettle of fish of it this morning  bless me my dear said mrs day what is the matter  not much replied her husband only a coach was stopped on the heath by three highwaymen and two of em is taken and now at next inn  dear sirs said mrs day it is the most preposteroustest thing in life that gentlefolks will not travel in post chaiseses and then they are always safe from these fellows  well well said her husband i must send after the third who escaped i will engage to find out his scarlet coat before night  were it not said mrs day that these poor creatures pay for being taken i am sure and certain my husband would never trouble his head about them because you know sir one of the gang will peach and then the others hang of course  what were the emotions of jacks soul cannot be expressed he felt agonies that all his former distresses had never plunged him into but recollecting his situation he chimd in with mrs day and spoke greatly against the disturbers of the public  at last he took his leave of mrs day mounted his chaise and got safe to london but often thought the horses were very bad  chap vi to he good is to be happy angels are happier than men because they are better guilt is the source of sorrow it is the fiend the avenging fiend that follows us behind with whips and stings the blessed know none of this but rest in everlasting peace of mind and find the height of all their heaven in goodness row guilt is a fiend that seizing the conscience becomes a tyrant over every idea of man remorse is his companion and suspicion and fear constantly pursue his steps disquietude engrosses every thought and even his sleeping imagination is filled with dread and horror  our poor hero is now an object of the greatest compassion  he knew not whom to trust where to fly for safety or how to live and he had now discovered that he was very unfit to die  he got to his lodging and telling the barber that he was engaged to a gentleman at hampstead he paid a weeks rent called a coach and drove with his effects to an inn in southwark  not secure in so public a place he found out a poor widow in a neighboring village with whom he agreed for diet and lodging here he was safe and quiet had his anxious thoughts permitted him any repose a fortnight passed and he paid the poor woman very punctually she began to conceive a very great opinion of mr conyers as his whole deportment was very regular and decent his mind now grew somewhat more calm and his sleep was less disturbed for he most sincerely repented of his folly and wickedness and with great fervency and devotion confessed his manifold transgressions and humbly prayed for mercy and forgiveness  his purse was extremely low he had thoughts of applying to some people he knew but durst not venture to london and his landlady was so poor she could not afford to give him credit  he almost determined to break his promise to mr johnston and write to lord truegood or mr kindly but as he knew not what apology to make for deferring it so long or how to account for his conduct he was obliged to lay the thought aside at least for the present  he frequently wept most bitterly and bewailed his wretched condition the agitation of his mind affected his health and threw him into a dangerous fever the poor woman was extremely tender and careful of him but his soul wanting as salutary remedies as his body he begged that a clergyman might be sent for and doctor st amor minister of the parish attended on the first notice this gentleman was one of those who reproach many of his profession for he was pious without moroseness and charitable without ostentation jack though extremely weak politely thanked the doctor for his condescension in visiting so poor so wretched so miserable a being  the good man with an easy countenance replied  if your situation sir is so bad i think you require and have a natural right to my more immediate and particular attention  the doctor prayed by him in the true spirit of devotion his exhortations were so filled with christian eloquence as warmed and cheered the heart of conyers and insensibly lightened his burdens  the fever still continued and the doctor never failed his morning and evening visits  jack was so charmed that he opened his whole soul to this good man and hid not the minutest part of all his affairs since his return from france  the gentleman flattered not his sins neither did he attempt to affright him with the dismal prospect of endless misery he skilfully probed and cleansed his wounds and then poured in the balsam of peace comfort and hopes of pardon by repentance and a newness of life  had mr dryden been acquainted with one man of dr st amours character i apprehend he would not have said that religion and roguery go together  in one of these conversations jack took an opportunity of mentioning the promise he made to mr kindly when he gave him the small box as spoken of in a former chapter  i am now sir said he so poor so indigent that i think i may safely open the present but i am so feeble that i must beg your assistance the doctor found the box in the trunk and opened it by the bedside  he pulled out a quantity of straw and at last a sheet of paper which he read and contained these words  my dear jack bounty hall      if you have kept your promise with regard to this box you must certainly be miserable when you read this i have a sincere and most affectionate regard for you and weep at the situation i must suppose you are in  should the will of the almighty afflict you with sickness or misfortunes patiently resign yourself into his hands who alone knows your necessities and who suffers not a sparrow to fall to the ground without his orders wait his good time without repining and firmly rely on his bounty  but should your calamities spring from wickedness folly and extravagance oh my child turn to the father of mercies and with a pure and upright heart confess your crimes repent of your faults read his word and practice his divine precept you will then know the blessing of righteousness the joys of virtue and the real felicity of conscious innocence but be not good only for a time beware of relapsing into mistaken pleasures ruin and reprobacy will follow and soul and body be at stake  oh jack if your heart be not hardened in iniquity if any spark remains of a virtuous education if gratitude be not dead in your breast think ere it is too late think on your own happiness and think on your assured friend  john kindly postscript under this paper you will find a proof of my love     as the doctor read jack wept the good man could not avoid sympathizing and with streaming eyes pursued the directions of the postscript but when he opened a paper nicely rolled and threw twenty guineas on the table poor jack attempted to speak but his tongue faultering he fainted on his pillow with some difficulty he recovered and a violent fit of crying ensued  yes cried he i will obey my father my friend and my guardian angel oh sir what has not this most worthy man done for me  he saved me when an infant and preserves me when a man good god can i be ungrateful to his hopes  can i disregard his charitable instructions  no if heaven prolongs my days they shall be employed in virtue and honor your resolution said dr st amor is truly just and i pray god to keep you firm in it but this present mark of his bounty is not the only one you have lately received  his providence has preserved you from the shameful infamous death that your hounslow companions suffered last week i have inquired particularly into that affair and find you have nothing to dread a third person was indeed spoken of at the trial but the name of constant or conyers was never mentioned let this suffice to ease your mind  follow mr kindlys advice and be happy  when alone he shudderd and wept at the fate of smart and brazen he reflected on the dreadful consequences of lawless pursuits he traced back his own life and wicked conduct and found that one vice generates another that as they grow in strength they corrupt the heart by degrees until the whole man is swallowed up in debauchery and his name and nature erazd out of the volume of the world  how fatal continued he is the beginning of evil and who can foresee the end  we go on from step to step regardless of danger we walk on fire covered with ashes no thought no prudence guides we dream of pleasure and delight but too often awake in the gulf of sorrow and perdition  how few like me have proved an almost miraculous escape and what thanks what gratitude do i not owe for my deliverance  his reflections were very just and moving and he promised to himself an entire change of conduct  his spirits began to revive and in a few days the fever left him he thanked the apothecary and desired his bill but the good doctor st amor had been beforehand with him so generous was this gentleman that he would not permit him to mention that or any other obligation he lay under  all i now want said the doctor is to see you quite recovered and then we shall think of somewhat for your service  in a week he was perfectly well though a little pale and when neatly dressed the doctor was surprised at his comely appearance  at last he proposed an employment to jack which he said he knew he could discharge extremely well  sir john curious continued he wants a young man like you to read to him and keep his private accounts i have satisfied him as to your abilities and he is willing to give you thirty pounds a year he is very old rich and gouty and sometimes peevish but a man must bear with the infirmities of superiors he then proceeded in a very useful lecture on a moral and political conduct  conyers returned him many acknowledgements and in two days he took a grateful adieu of the good widow and fixed in london with the family of sir john curious  chap vii you cannot love nor pleasure take or give but life begin when it is too late to live on a tired courser you pursue delight let slip your morning and set out at night dryden never man began an employment with more pleasure he seemed as if returned again into life and was determined to spare no pains in enjoying it  his first care was a particular attention to his duty and his next was to find out the family economy that he might adapt himself to their different tempers  sir john curious was sixtyseven years of age very corpulent and extremely infirm when his gout was not violent he dined with his company and was very cheerful from seven to nine at night jack read to him at ten he went to bed but never rose till about eleven next morning two servants attended him and about one oclock all his flannels were removed and in an old embroidered coat and great wig he sat in his armchair and jack did the duty of his office till three oclock  he did sir robert walpole the honor of being his enemy and looked on the craftsman equal if not superior to holy writ consequently these papers were every moment quoted in this choice of books he had great judgment and to show it fully he delighted in the works of tailor the water poet in an old and only translation of dubartus in huge folios of heraldry and when inclined to sleep in the modern pamphlets and weekly papers  his housesteward had a good salary and a certain quarterly sum for providing all things for the family this sum was accounted for but could not be exceeded to examine and checque these accounts was part of jacks duty  sir john had always maintained the character of a fine gentleman his dress was gay and his manner such that supported the dignity he assumed it was a question whether pride or avarice had the superiority in his constitution but it is certain they frequently acted in concert pride obliged him to a punctuality in paying his debts but avarice prevented his going a step beyond it  pride made him extremely courteous complaisant and ceremonious because he loved to be so treated himself but avarice stopped his ears against the cries of the poor expelled every sentiment of charity and benevolence and contracted and abridgd some of his vices even when he had the power of being vicious in a word sir john had a negative character and acquired the title of a good sort of man that is his vices were not many but he had not a single virtue  he had seen enough of one part of the world to convince him that there was no such thing as a modest woman this happy imagination kept him a bachelor till at the age of sixtythree love or some other monosyllable stumbled into his head  the charms of miss bridoon his sadlers daughter made him so generous as to propose a marriage and relinquish a fortune whilst this treaty was on foot his relations interposed and some of his most intimate friends spoke pretty freely about it they said it was highly prudent in him to marry but begged he would consider his age and the infirmities growing on him that a girl of eighteen was quite out of the rule of proportion that a mechanicks daughter was unworthy his rank and fortune and an indignity to his family that no one could answer for the conduct of a young girl especially one of low education and begged him to turn his eyes on some lady whose years would guarantee her virtue and make him happy in a faithful companion  oons cried the knight what the plague would you be at i tell you my age is no impediment for i find myself as vigorous as at twenty if children not my own inherit my name and estate is it not the practice of every day is it not much better than the heathen scheme of adoption  the honor of my family which my virtuous sister makes such a noise about is a farce and i suppose she thought so when she ran away with my fathers footman does she imagine that the son of such a scoundrel shall enjoy my fortune  then as to a virtuous wife i know the world too well to expect such a one but i likewise know that i had rather have a part in a young wench than the whole of any old woman breathing  in short sir john was resolute or rather positive miss bridoon was advanced to his bed and consummatum est rang through the parish  lady curious was extremely pretty her eyes spoke and her great vivacity and sprightliness had attractive qualities  an house magnificently furnished  a number of servants with coach chariot etc were so infinitely beyond her hopes that her little head began to turn her constitution and soil were so good that the seeds of example grew up surprizingly fast and afforded a plentiful crop of the most fashionable follies in a short time she had contracted a variety of acquaintance and vastly improved in modern politeness  plays operas and visits went a constant round and drums routs and assemblies employed her time at home and abroad she had a passion for play and played very deep here indeed her low birth was conspicuous for not being educated from her childhood like other ladies of quality in the true principles of gaming she made but a small progress in that science and played so ill and lost so much money that her charming company was greatly courted and admired  sir john was very indifferent about these matters he allowed her two hundred pounds a year as pinmoney but was so rigid and exact that no art nor all her ladyships contrivances could extract a shilling more  conyers knew of large sums lost at cards and was surprised how her ladyship could answer so many demands but at last he discovered that her playpurse was inexhaustible  notwithstanding the multitude of affairs and the variety of employments on her hands she found a time to present to sir john a brace of fine boys her ladyship was happy the old knight was content and family affairs went on with great harmony  in about three months conyers picked out this information from the steward and mrs sieve her ladyships woman this last threw in some nods winks and innuendos but the honor of her lady was always sacred mrs sieve conceived a good opinion of jack and on many occasions gave him proofs of her esteem  he had felt the fatal effects of such friendship and was determined to avoid every temptation  he shunned her presence as much as possible and even slighted her favors  his conduct was such an affront to her pride and beauty that she shifted sides and became an implacable enemy  this kind creature had laid many schemes to prepossess her lady against jack she insinuated that his impudence had not only dared to make attempts on her virtue but had even muttered reflections on her ladyship  fired at his insolence my lady determined to have him immediately kicked out but the artful sieve begged of her ladyship not to disparage herself so much as to speak of such an affair but to worm the the fellow out by degrees  the resolution being taken my lady never ceased teizing sir john till he grew peevish  mrs sieve affronted jack openly and the steward treated him with great impertinence conyers found a very visible change in the countenances of the whole family and was made very uneasy in his duty but knew not what to ascribe it to  one evening sir john used him a little harshly but the humility of jack spoke much in his favor and obliged the knight with some good humor to ask him what he had done to my lady and her woman  i protest sir said jack i have done nothing  nothing cried sir john nay then i know your crime you can never be forgiven  oons a handsome fellow of your age in such a family as this and do nothing  thou art a silly blockhead and i am sorry for it but travel you must however i am determined you shall stay till i get you another service and have one in your place  jack had been so accustomed to disappointments that he bore this with great temper and resignation he informed his friend dr st amor of this revolution and told him what was the occasion of it which he had learned from the housemaid the good man lifted up his eyes begged of him to have patience and promised to look out for a more agreeable employment  some days after conyers was busy with sir john when mr sampson entered the knight had a great regard for this gentleman and was extremely civil to him well friend sampson said he time was when we used to meet oftener but this plaguey gout makes me perform a tedious quarentine you see  ah sir john replied mr sampson you are at anchor in a safe harbor but i have all your ailments and am buffetted about in stormy winds  not so not so answered the knight i hope my old friend and acquaintance is in no danger of shipwreck  no misfortunes i hope  none said mr sampson but what my temper can bear  i have lost my only child just such a youth as that pointing to jack i have lost the best part of my substance by the war and i have found old age and infirmities  but is it not just i should resign with patience what i enjoyed and held but at the will of the donor  mr sampson said sir john you were always a philosopher but i am really concerned at your misfortunes perhaps some money at this time may have its use and i wish it was in my power to assist you but really my family is so expensive that i am quite poor at present i wish i had seen you last week for it is but two days ago since i parted with all my ready money on a mortgage  truly i am angry at your not acquainting me with your distresses  indeed i am  and you know the pleasure i take in assisting my worthy friends  you are extremely good replied mr sampson but thank god i am in no want when my debts are collected which are very numerous i shall have more than sufficient to maintain my dear wife and i in a comfortable manner indeed i am ill able to attend my friends and much want an honest young fellow to assist me  i believe said sir john i am pretty deep in your books  the last christening consumed a deal of wine but if you have the bill i shall see and discharge it  mr sampson thanked the knight and received one hundred and forty pounds for which jack drew a receipt for him to sign  i protest sir said the merchant your young man writes a charming hand and i dare say understands accounts  that he does answered sir john and extremely well he is honest sober and diligent and i heartily wish you had his equal what will you give me mr sampson if i assign him over to you provided he consents  i shall give you answered the other my sincere thanks and the young man the best usage in my power  in two words replied the knight i know of no fault he has but being too virtuous and modest for my good family my ladys maid has set my lady against him i know their tricks but i dont mind them  some questions passed and in less than half an hour the affair was concluded on  jack received fifteen pounds for six months wages and wishing sir john all happiness once more shifted his station  chap viii a genealogical table true or false of illustrious ancestors a large estate a numerous equipage and considerable employments are what we generally call noble but virtue judges in a different manner she takes the great from amidst the grandour which surrounds him undresses him of the vanity that disguises him and rates the value of the man by the man himself under the appearance of nobility she may find a fool a villain or a coward and in a plebeian obscurity discover real greatness and probity of manners as right reason is of all countries the wise in all ages have spoken on this subject in one uniform constant manner  sanadons note on  th s of  st b of horace our hero is now brought to that time of life when sense and judgment are to be expected or never he has been happy  he has been in trouble  he has been for him rich  he has been poor and in the utmost affliction these are the pages of the book of nature and those who read them not carefully must have very imperfect ideas of the system of the universe  he was once more happy he had a pleasure from the countenance of mr sampson which was open and free with every indication of an honest and tender heart mrs sampson could not refrain a few tears at the sight of conyers for it happened that he much resembled her deceased son she viewed him with pleasure but it was mixed with anxiety she regarded him as a child and he respected her as a parent  in his employment he was extremely assiduous and careful and went on very successfully in collecting mr sampsons debts and settling his accounts the good man was happy for conyers as much as possible made all things easy to him in a short time he acquired their favor and confidence and was perfectly familiar  the boy the very young man was quite over his thoughts were serious but he acted with vigor his deportment was decent and his conversation cheerful and agreeable his duty was his pleasure and the love and respect of the family was his reward which they could not avoid showing before all their friends  mrs sampson and her sister had been coheiresses and had each an estate in  of about five hundred pounds a year the sister had been married to mr gold a turkey merchant who died about four years since and added fifteen thousand pounds to her fortune mrs gold was near thirtyseven years of age of a noble presence with great good nature and prudence she continued a widow in spite of many solicitations and so affectionately loved her sister that she removed her habitation to be nearer to her when mr sampson was in distress with his creditors mrs gold advanced him six thousand pounds on his and her sisters security  the sisters were almost constantly with each other and conyers was always of the party  mrs gold had read and had an excellent understanding mrs sampson was a cheerful and agreeable companion  her husband had solid sense and great good humor and conyers enlivened the conversation by a thousand pleasant circumstances but with such natural elegance and beauty that greatly pleased improved and diverted  sometimes their entertainment was of a serious nature and fell on the follies of the world  the mad extravagance of some and the equally mad penury of others  on justice virtue charity and the like  mrs gold spoke on these heads with great strength of reason and mr conyers enforced her arguments by sundry historical passages and by accidents to which he had been witness he was a master of the subject and at different times went through the moral and social duties with such spirit and force that they were charmed with his knowledge and edified by his words  happy would it be said mrs gold if all mankind thought like mr conyers  and still more so replied her sister if they acted like him for i verily believe he practices his own doctrine  madam answered conyers i am extremely happy in your good opinion but permit me to say though i endeavor and i hope do my duty as i ought yet i have greatly erred i have been idle i have been extravagant and i speak it to my shame i have been vicious but the goodness of this family strengthens my resolution and confirms me in my honest purposes of amendment  if replied mrs gold you have been criminal your confession and repentance increases your worth  who has not been criminal said mr sampson  to commit a fault is bad but to persevere is infamous for aught i know vice has its use as it sets off and heightens the beauties of virtue to such a degree that common sense and even ignorance must be charmed with it  mr conyers said mrs gold has one virtue which i wish was a little more general though he has been so good agreeably to entertain us with persons and things yet has he never dropped an harsh expression against particulars nor has he given matters an ill natured construction  scandal madam said conyers let it inhabit where it will is a mean and vulgar vice it is a poor and vile attempt to raise our own reputation on the ruins of another when some condemn the actions of a man and paint his conduct in odious colors do they not at the same time modestly intimate that they are incapable of such errors  pride speaks not their pity to compassionate the frailties and weaknesses of a man is the duty of a man it is his office to set him right by tenderness and humanity and not by reproach and slander to lead him more astray should he continue in his folly the wisest maxim is to commiserate his infirmities and avoid an imitation  some evenings they passed their time at cards and sometimes the ladies went to a play attended by conyers this gave rise to a variety of pleasant chat where jack showed his memory and good taste but it was a considerable time before they discovered he had an excellent voice mrs gold was fond of music and he humming a favorite air  bless me said she i protest you have it quite perfect  we must insist on your singing it out  he made a few apologies but obeyed  this was what the family did not expect and increased their surprise and pleasure  by degrees he showed his skill in the french language  that he was no stranger to latin and greek and that he understood dancing fencing and horsemanship in a word he showed them what a gentleman ought to be  the behavior of conyers puzzled mrs gold  she could not conceive how a man in his station could acquire so many genteel accomplishments she thought there was a mystery in it and when she had just determined to find it out lord bless me said she why should i trouble myself about what is not my concern at that instant she felt a prodigious flushing in her face and some sensations she had not been lately accustomed to she began to suspect the cause and with great caution sat down to examine her heart and reason with herself  that is  to find out reasons to correspond with her inclinations the truth is she discovered so many that interest and the pride of family were fairly routed and prudence and esteem got the better she would not call it love as she thought it a too sensual term for one of her years she owned she regarded the virtues and qualifications of mr conyers but the comeliness of his person was merely accidental and quite out of the question however that contingent and his youth had certainly some weight  be this as it will her resolution was taken but determined not to proceed too rashly on a certain day when she knew her sister would not stir out she wrote her a card and begged mr conyers might be sent to take care of her to the play where she was engaged with some company jack dressed himself properly and waited on mrs gold he had no schemes in view so his actions were free and without reserve he had a great regard for the widow which made him fond of every opportunity of obliging her perhaps she had observed this and gave it a flattering construction he found her most neatly dressed and for the first time particularly remarked her charms  i am quite ashamed said she to give mr conyers so much trouble for nothing our party is broke but rather than miss the conscious lovers i was determined to beg your company alone had not mrs talkative and her daughter sent word they would drink tea with me  conyers said he was sorry she was disappointed but rejoiced at every occasion that could show his readiness in obeying her commands a few words passed and he attempted to take his leave which she would not permit after all said she we can be as well at home and my brother will not expect you till after the play a conversation then began on the comedy and many remarks were made on the odd situation of indiana and the noble constancy of bevil a loud rap at the door spoke the arrival of mrs and miss talkative and stopped their proceedings  a new field now opened in a short time all the tittletattle of the parish was displayed lord mrs gold you surprise me  not hear of this before not i indeed madam dear madam i purtest i have forgot most of the particlers for the story is four days old very strange indeed why my dear they were actually caught but matrimony salves all this sort of rational entertainment lasted till tea was produced which a little eased the thoughts of conyers he seemed to bend his eyes and regard on miss talkative who was very pretty and had began a sort of conversation mrs gold observed it which added not to her repose she was so absent that her teacup slipped from her hand and broke to pieces which broke off their chat tea finished she put on a grave air and the ladies put on their capuchins to complete their evening visits  conyers unwittingly had like to have spoiled all but mrs golds hinting one must be civil to such sort of people gave him an opportunity of saying he wondered of what use they were in the world the daughter said he is pretty but the eternal clatter of her little tongue will give some poor man a great deal of vexation and yet said mrs gold her fortune will get her a husband you men are all alike and i dare say you would snap at her in an instant if you could i shall not said jack affirm or deny a thing i have not thought about for i neither know the lady or her fortune but really madam i think i ought to have been exempted in your general censure were i capable of marrying merely for money the situation i am in and my poverty would excuse me to the world but who would excuse me to my conscience who would give me joy of an equipage when compelled to take pride affectation folly and nonsense to my arms i may be ambitious but i assure you madam poor as i am i have not the least ambition of being miserable  mrs gold was not displeased at his sentiments and the conversation turned on more diverting subjects though she at last very dexterously contrived to bring matrimony once more on the carpet i own my surprise said she that a young man of your understanding has not found out one woman capable of making you happy and easy such there are but you are either too indolent or indifferent or else your heart is engaged to some distant fair one  come mr conyers be sincere and indulge a curiosity our sex is subject to and recite your adventures for i am apt to believe they must be somewhat extraordinary  in truth madam said conyers they are not worth your notice but since you command it is my duty to obey  he then began a narrative of his life and painted his sufferings in a very moving manner he artfully avoided the place of his birth or the least hint of ireland as it might occasion scandal he carried her to the weavers in spittlefields conducted her to france and brought her back to london his amors were very delicately handled but his hounslow expedition was quite expunged he dwelt long on mr kindlys instructions and letter and the misery he was in in surry his history was long and sometimes so affecting that mrs gold was obliged to make frequent use of her handkerchief she pitied him because he was unfortunate and he began to love her because he saw she pitied him  when he had ended a profound silence ensued  since said she at last your heart is free perhaps i may assist in setting your mind at ease  i thing i know a lady who has power and inclination equal to it will you give me leave to try my skill permit me madam said jack to return my most humble acknowledgements for your goodness but as you have required my sincerity i shall still continue it and with that honest freedom your good sense will excuse i have no objections madam to matrimony and have a certain constancy in my nature that might make me a good husband but i cannot answer for my temper if i did not most affectionately love my wife to have that love i must know her i must converse with her i must first admire her virtues and esteem her understanding this madam is not the work of a week or a month and to marry otherwise there is a possibility of being happy but the chances are infinitely against me true i may be made rich but an hundred to one i may be made wretched  your reasons said mrs gold are very just yet i believe you will allow there are some exceptions neither do i want any personal compliment when i ask you if a woman of fortune and everyway like me could please you  madam  said jack  i  i  really know not how or what to answer she saw him confused and added  i shall make it plainer suppose for argumentsake i should have such a notion in my head  do you think you could truly and sincerely regard me regard you madam replied conyers  yes on my soul i should for ever regard love and adore you  but dear madam why do you take pleasure in tormenting so poor an animal  why do you question me like a prisoner on the rack and make me confess what my safety obliges me to hide  but i have done and can scarcely hope your pardon for what i have already said  mr conyers said she with a bashful air i not only pardon but shall endeavor to mitigate your anxieties i have seen and examined your conduct i have viewed your actions i have read your heart and i think have discovered in you a soul incapable of meanness or falsehood  though you have no fortune i have often thought you deserved one  i speak to your understanding and am not afraid of being censured by it let the lucrative world run after wealth it has pleased heaven to indulge me with enough to make too rational creatures happy should you be of the same opinion the little share i can give is freely at your service  she hung down her head and impatiently waited a reply  conyers gazed  his eyes were fixed and his mouth could only seem to speak at length he rose up and throwing aside all consideration embraced mrs gold in so tender so ardent a manner that convinced her of his sincerity beyond the utterance of a thousand words and vain speeches confess said she that i have acted like a woman of courage by making the first attack i wish my prudence be not more suspected though said conyers the world will talk yet believe me i shall give them such a subject that our love and harmony shall be rather envied than imitated  give me leave to call you my dearest life and to assure you without vanity that you entirely possess an heart free from flattery art or deceit oh make me once more happy and say you will be mine mr conyers said she there is my hand my heart you have already but no more you have my promise and rely on it dear madam said conyers let me not seem too impatient by asking when be satisfied said she it shall not be long for i hope soon to bring my brother and sister into my scheme but i beg your silence till then  conyers promised to be directed by her and supper being served a different conversation began however it was once more renewed and many tender and affectionate expressions the eloquence of undisguisd passion were mutually given and received till time with hasty steps approached the hour of twelve  with some difficulty they parted  he soon retired to bed but not to rest for mrs gold had murdered sleep  twould be tedious to mention the method she took to open this affair to her sister she was her own mistress but still wanted a sanction no doubt the reader will imagine the surprise of the family and he must likewise imagine the many arguments on both sides before mrs sampson and her husband consented which at last they did the truth is mrs gold like most of the world asked advice but was determined to follow her own there was no necessity for a settlement but a small writing was drawn in favor of children on failure of which the longest liver took all except five thousand pounds which each had a power to bequeath by will  thus all matters being adjusted the day was fixed and doctor st amor acquainted with it who provided a proper place at putney where he met the company the good man loaded jack with caresses and compliments and felicitated mrs gold on her happy choice i must madam said he admire and shall for ever admire your judgment and understanding that could discover virtue and honor under the cloud of poverty dispel the mist and take it to your arms  he made a very pathetick discourse but his conclusion was infinitely pleasing to mr conyers and perhaps not less so to mrs gold for he joined their hands and ending his part of the ceremony blessed the happy pair and left them to finish the remainder  chap ix grant me the social joys of life in easy converse free from strife not wrangling for an empty name but raising virtue into fame not with vile breath abuse the great and prate because i dare to prate but hear instruction or to give and learn or teach each day i live anonimous the generality of the world regard the actions of men but according to the event a prosperous villain may be internally despised though his wealth and grandeur will be outwardly admired and even envied  praise is sacrificed to poor and indigent virtue but every other reward is too frequently neglected the wise man of old tells us that time and chance happens unto all men  when misfortunes and calamities attack us the world is so good to pity but at the same time impute the unhappiness to a want of proper conduct and to a multitude of errors  when affluence pours in and plenty surrounds us they admire the judgment and applaud the understanding  thus the wretched and miserable tax providence with partiality but the happy and successful attribute all to their own prudence and superior merit  our friend mr conyers could not avoid some few compliments to his person and abilities as they were the motives of his advancement but when he reflected on the goodness of his wife in noticing and rewarding them so amply he discovered that they proceeded from a superior cause which as it reached above his comprehension he could only wonder at and by praising the giver make returns of love and gratitude to the instrument  by reasoning thus and lowering his own value as much as he heightened the goodness of providence his mind became more calm and his heart less liable to vanity he was not too elate or puffed up for by regarding his wife more than her fortune the world was compelled to believe he deserved both  never was woman more happy than mrs conyers and never could a husband take more pains to oblige a wife envy saw this but hid her head  malice with squinting eye and jibing tongue looked and spoke in vain jealousy and vile insinuation found their arrows blunted or sticking in the shield of right understanding the fabric was so firmly fixed on honor and good sense that the decay of nature could alone sap the foundation  mr conyers still assisted his brother sampson and having got in most of his debts and settled all his affairs proposed at the request of his wife to retire to the country they agreed to live in a small town near their estate and having provided every household necessary and a good collection of books they quitted the noisy city for the peace tranquillity and joys of a rural life he now found himself possessed of above twelve hundred pounds a year and calling to his memory the conduct of lord truegood resolved as near as possible to follow the example of so worthy a nobleman like a prudent general he planned out his operations he collected his forces and assigned to each part a just proportion his distribution was exact but mrs conyers changed it a little by making him sensible that his scheme had not provided for sickness and many other accidents they were liable to let us my dear said she live as genteely as you please but where is the absolute necessity of spending our whole income my advice is to save at least three hundred pounds a year to answer contingencies and assist a worthy friend on occasion neither do i see how we can well lay out the remainder my life said jack you are quite in the right then be it so it is but striking out these two extraordinary horses a servant one dish a day something from the wine and a little from the allowance of clothes and pleasurable expenses and the affair is just as you desire  the behavior of this family soon acquired the esteem and respect of the neighboring gentlemen and ladies particular friendships were formed and a charming society enlivened every amusement  some gentlemen met twice a week at the best inn in the town to benefit the house and keep up a proper interest and our friend was soon invited to be of the number it will not be amiss to mention some of this good company  sir john dobson and old colonel manly were the principal the knight had been member for the county in three parliaments as the colonel had been for the town for almost forty years mr leatherhead mr ash doctor grace who was minister of the parish and mr conyers made six constant companions our ladies were happy with mrs grace and family and with miss lucy manly the daughter of the colonel now a most amiable girl of seventeen years of age her wit and understanding with her tender and compassionate heart made her the joy of her friends no wonder the colonel was extremely fond for she was the child of his age and his only one he spoke with pleasure of the vast fortune he intended to leave her and often said he almost envied the happy man to whose lot she fell  with great care and attention have i examined the original memoirs of this history but unfortunately found not the least hint of amors or as it is called the gallantry of mr conyers during his residence in the country this must certainly be a tedious time to a reader of genius who expects at every page a well or illcontrived intrigue or somewhat wonderful or surprising to raise his imagination and keep up his attention  though i cannot answer these valuable ends i cannot pass in silence this space as my materials are large but must supply the want of extraordinary adventures in this seeming state of inactivity with the substance of the most interesting subjects that made their evenings pass usefully and agreeably away  in doing this i shall stick to my usual brevity and trespass as little as possible on the patience of the goodnatured i shall not summon them to every assembly but vary the subject by an asterism  and avoid that sort of connection that might pin me down to form and ceremonies      in our last argument said mr conyers sir john gave us a long dissertation on the liberty of the press i think we all agreed to the usefulness of it in general and to the danger of suppressing any part yet i cannot help thinking it a little hard that a person shall have it in his power to make a man ridiculous whenever he pleases to imagine he does wrong what are most of our pamphlets and news papers stuffed with but encomiums on those out of place and scurrilous reflections on those in  were we to shift the scene would not the new ministry be abused like the former and perhaps by the same writers i do not pretend to be a politician but believe many who do are just as ignorant as i am every man who spells may write satyr that is may write maliciously as it requires little or no genius but to write with truth candor and impartiality to have judgment sufficient to point out real errors but humanity and goodnature not to strike at persons and characters is not given to every man  i grant you said sir john some make an ill use of liberty and leap beyond the bounds if they go too far the law is open and to the law we must leave them it is very true said mr conyers but they have found out a jesuitical way of evading even the best law here are a parcel of pamphlets and newspapers which he threw on the table filled with initial letters dashes and stars though we clearly see the insolence and treason what jury as the law now stands can properly condemn the author or printer to lose his ears  well well said sir john no matter let them scribble on provided they do not oblige me to believe all their impertinence  men of sense sir john answered conyers will always think in that manner but how many honest wellmeaning gentlemen suffer themselves to be imposed on merely for want of due attention perhaps some must write thus or starve in that case i sincerely pity them yet i hope mankind have not such vitiated tastes as to be delighted only with scandal would a writer fix on a plan of instruction  would he inculcate the fear of god and honor to the king  would he endeavor to make us better parents better children and better friends to society  would he employ his time and learning to persuade us to unanimity and not discord and confusion who amongst us  what honest man but would praise and applaud him but to write from principles of envy and ill nature and to sow those pestilent seeds in the minds of the unwary is certainly a conduct that even vice will condemn to him who writes fluently and well but with such intentions i shall only say what a noble lord did of the earl of stafford that god had given him talents but the devil the application  were it possible said the doctor to restrain the liberty of the press without endangering the liberty of the people i am convinced we should be much happier and much more free from squabbles and idle disputes but the experiment is of too tender and delicate a nature to wish seeing it attempted though i verily believe newswriters and pamphleteers are the collectors of the fifth great tax in the kingdom       whatever the equity may be said sir john i hope never to see a new valuation for a land tax our acres are pretty well charged already so let them look elsewhere if they want to raise more money  yet replied mr conyers all taxes must at last center on land i must beg leave replied the doctor to differ from you  for example suppose that a duty was laid on the exportation of our nobility and gentry according to their titles how could such a tax affect the land  they travel for health or pleasure and i think ought to pay fifty or an hundred pounds to their own country for permission to spend the remainder of their fortunes in another upon my word said squire ash a very notable and reasonable scheme then continued the doctor if every man who accepted an employment of one hundred pounds a year was obliged to pay a years salary to the state and a proportionable tax on the commissioners of land and seaofficers would it not raise a large sum and how would it affect our lands  in holland they have what is called a collateral tax that is the inheriter of a fortune in land or money not descending to him in a direct line pays   per cent to the state when they sell lands or tenements the seller and purchaser pay two or three per cent of the value to the government  thus gentlemen it is plain there are many ways of raising money where taxes so far from raising our manufactures might be so managed as to go infinitely cheaper to foreign markets  i assure you cried colonel manly i never thought my friend doctor grace had so calculating an head and i dare say were the ministry acquainted with his genius he would soon have lawn sleeves i am so pleased with his money projects that i must add one which i wonder he forgot for example suppose all the livings of the clergy of england were to be new valued and the clergy who succeed after a certain day were obliged to pay to the government one year of that valuation by four equal payments in four years would not this likewise make a large fund and how would it affect our lands permit me to explain my scheme by figures  doctor grace has churchpreferments to above  00 l a year i shall only charge   0 l  out of this i shall deduct full land tax at   s  0 two curates  at most  0 remainder clear to the doctor besides marriage christening and burial fees  00 l   0  now i would value these livings but at two hundred pounds a year in the kings new books and where would be the mighty injustice to oblige his successor to pay that sum in four years and how would it affect our lands were this chamber replied the doctor a chamber of parliament i should vastly disappoint the colonel by heartily concurring in such a scheme properly regulated but i should certainly vote for exempting the poor clergy agreed said the colonel so let it be resolved that no clergyman shall be liable to this new duty who has not one hundred pounds a year clear of all deductions raillery apart said mr conyers i sincerely think somewhat of this nature ought to be done and the clergy of france have set us very good examples the wisdom of government is best seen in the just partition of taxes to charge them who are rich in this world is true policy and to ease the poor labourer is equal to it to lessen the tax on the consumption of the poor is in fact an advantage to the rich as all manufactures and workmanship must lessen in proportion  the doctor mentioned said sir john something of poor clergy i am really ashamed to see so many in such a country as england who appear like objects of charity and thought that when queen anne gave up her first fruits to buy glebe and impropriated tithes they would all have comfortable livings but i am vastly disappointed nor can i conceive why they are not in a better situation all i know replied the doctor is that the trustees for that useful work have had the first fruits and tenths above thirty years they have purchased many glebes and i dare say from their great virtues and high dignities every thing in their power has been done for the good of the church if they have not added more to the livings of poor clergy i must suppose they could get no more to purchase or wanted a fund  far be it from me said mr conyers to hint the least reflection on the honor or integrity of gentlemen in such eminent stations but from what the doctor has said and from what i have heard on this subject i must conclude that there has been no misapplication of money on the contrary i am informed very little has been applied if my intelligence be true a capital and the interest of a capital has been suffered to accumulate to so mighty a sum that i am cautious to mention it the revenue is certainly large and should the trustees not have found out purchases i see no reason but that twenty thirty or forty pounds in money should be given annually to many poor clergymen which i humbly apprehend would fully answer the intent of the charitable donor whether the trustees have expended their whole fund or whether they are enabled to support twenty or two hundred clergymen i cannot positively assert but sure i am that as the wisdom of the legislature would not be less manifested by a fair and honest enquiry into it so i am equally satisfied that the integrity and honor of the trustees would be thus clearly demonstrated and malevolent and clamorous tongues silenced      truly sir john said the doctor i am sorry matters were carried so far yesterday we had warm words very warm words in the name of goodness what had they or we to do in the affair if the french prevail over us i am sorry for it and pray god it may be otherwise if we beat them i rejoice and am thankful but to argue that some things ought to have been done and that others ought to have been undone is certainly idle for i profess i believe we know nothing of the matter right right said sir john but you know my rule is never to contradict or dispute about what i do not understand especially when i am convinced that my antagonist is equally ignorant  such disputants said the colonel are the plague of society the more they seem gentlemen the more mischief they do for as they choose and commonly herd but with people of inferior capacities they pass current for vast geniuses and are applauded for their mighty understandings i have often laughed to hear a company of honest citizens fighting over the very battles i had been in and minutely mentioning a thousand circumstances that never did or could have happened and have endeavored and sometimes with success to put my good countrymen right i remember when i was a young man and returned from the campaign of   0  when the duke of marlborough did not fight the french i strolld into a city coffeehouse where a young pert soapboiler was most eloquently displaying his talents and diverting his audience with the blunders and misconduct of the duke  i own i was foolish enough to be provoked and longed to chastize his insolence at last the young man to illustrate his subject chalked out two lines on the table  now gentlemen said he here lay the french  and here the allied army with this trifling river between them  now still pointing with his finger why the devil the duke did not cross the river and beat the french scoundrels is past my comprehension  he was proceeding but i lost all patience for stretching over my cane i gave his fingers a pretty severe rebuke  he rose in anger and demanded a reason when i very coolly replied  it was only to convince him that in passing a river an army might receive a rap over the knuckles the laugh of the company was on my side and the poor soapboiler looked mighty silly  why there it is said sir john an honest innocent man cannot speak his mind freely but up comes a red coat and knocks him down  the colonel says he was then young and foolish but how many have we of the same stamp at this day  god help us when we are to be governed or rather controlled by a standing army  god help us indeed replied the colonel but for my part i promise you i will never live to see that day  that may be answered squire ash but really i cannot help thinking some people are making large strides toward it and where it may end heaven knows  is it not a plain case they want to make us a military government by raising such an army and employing them in a foolish war on the continent where every news paper will tell you we have not the least business  if we must have a war and be blooded by taxes let us a gods name give the queen of hungary her bellyfull of money but let us spare the blood of old england  well said mr ash replied sir john you speak my sentiments and i believe the sentiments of every honest man in great britain but i am afraid all this mighty hurry and noise and expense of blood and treasure is more on account of some g  d  than any good intended to us if they mean a real advantage to england let them send forth her wooden walls and scour the ocean  we may do some good there and let europe fight on the continent to eternity provided we keep them out of our own natural territories nay the more they quarrel and knock one anothers brains out abroad the better it is for us at home read our annals colonel they were glorious times when our honest militia headed by country gentlemen could step out and beat the french on their own ground pray sir said the colonel what business had these country gentlemen and gallant militia in france  business replied sir john  why they went to conquer and keep the french at a distance and when they had conquered to keep their conquests had we not normandy aquitain anjou and almost half of france very true answered the colonel and as if it were done to show us our folly a woman drove this mighty militia almost out of all ay said mr conyers and we were full as glorious when we burnt this poor woman for a witch those said the doctor were the days of glorious ignorance had our ancestors conquered part of france or had provinces descended by right to our kings they were mad to pretend to keep them for the good of england  had they erected a kingdom within that kingdom and given it an head of importance and weight they would have done wisely  very well observed cried mr conyers i fear the church militant will be too hard for country gentlemen  i must beg your patience said colonel manly for i have a few words to offer and hope i shall never be called on this subject again  the vicinity said he of great britain and france and the rivalship in glory and trade will ever make them natural enemies to each other the views of france are as unbounded as ambition ours are more confined and rather lead us to checque the exorbitant power of others than to increase our own  when lewis the xivth made war on the dutch and gave his glory for the reason it was the height of true glory to resist and checque such an unchristian scheme but unhappily our charles the second was his pensioner  when this mighty lewis contrary to faith and solemn treaties gave spain to his grandson our interest joined to frustrate the project but when charles our king of spain became head of the empire our interest opposed his being master of two such monarchies though perhaps our policy was unsound to suffer spain to fall to any branch of the house of bourbon  in the present war when france in violation of the most solemn engagements and in the midst of profound peace attacked the empire  when she had made the queen of hungary a fugitive even to the subjects she or her family had oppressed the most  when she had near overturned the great weight that kept her ambition from trampling on the neck of europe our interest our happiness and our honor compelled us to join against her  if our little army in flanders was not so successful as we wished they were led on with a noble spirit they fought like themselves and retired from numbers rather fatigued than conquered  we now know the truth we now know the value of hanoverian troops though patriots or rather party deprived us of   000 and made lewis triumph we know how near the few of our small army who fought were of routing the whole strength of the grand monarch  we know our troops deserved though they had not victory  we now praise their valor but the french do more  they dread it  in the name of god how can our government or our general act  if we had not sent troops to flanders to convince the world we were hearty in the cause and in some measure to persuade the dutch into our sentiments what a load of scandal would have issued from the press  if our general had tamely looked on and not attempted the relief of tournay would not every scribbling fellow pour down from his garret as much abuse as they now honor him with for acting otherwise  oh but we were repulsed at fontenoy and have lost flanders  what then  if we argue from consequences we had best never begin because we can never end  in war as in law trade and every other human project it suffices that the motive of action was founded in reason justice and honor but as to the consequences we must submit to the disposer of all things  king william and queen annes wars had the same rise perhaps that glorious monarch deserved as much praise in his defeats as the great marlborough received for his victories the king did not escape calumny  marlborough had his share  was disgraced and even exiled for conquering  let us cast our eyes round europe even in times of peace and shall we not find them all armed and greatly armed  and shall we supinely rest content and pay no regard to our safety  though some affect to call our regiments a standing army though the whole is little more than a french grand guard yet we dread from it the loss of our liberty  thank god i have a good estate but were our army double their numbers i would not sell my land for a shilling less  all europe think our property consequently our liberty quite secure otherwise they would never trust their millions in our funds  this is the touchstone of our credit and character abroad  this is the barometer of the state  whilst our officers are natives whilst they are men of family and fortune and have their share in the common blessing i think i may positively pronounce our liberty is safe  not to speak in too peremptory a manner i will allow that an army little or great is a very useless nay a dangerous thing without experience and the strictest discipline but god forbid they should ever acquire that experience in their own country  since experience is absolutely necessary where ought they learn it but abroad  in our private capacities we must keep our honor and preserve our reputation even sometimes at the hazard of our lives but who would not hazard more if possible when his property his family and every thing dear to him are trampled upon  a nation in this is as a private man  we ought to acquire reputation but be careful to keep it  we must make ourselves respected but by good conduct preserve that dignity  we ought to love peace but by a constant readiness for war be able to maintain the one with honor or pursue the other with justice and glory  a word more and i have done i know what sir john means by german dominions without entering into what perhaps none of us rightly understands i really imagine that a monarch has some small title to the natural liberty of other men and may be allowed the same natural inclinations i am ashamed this argument is so often thrown out  could i divest myself of the duty i owe him as my sovereign i should still respect and honor his justice and valor were he but a private gentleman let us not my friends foolishly and wantonly condemn but let us rather endeavor to make his life happy and content whilst heaven is pleased to spare him to us let us as free subjects love him and imitate those over whom he is absolute by the laws but over whose hearts his clemency and uprightness has established a more absolute sway  sir john has given me the text but the conclusion i must borrow from the doctor  from what has been said god grant us a right understanding and that we may think on and practice it in our life and conversation  amen cried the doctor with all my heart i think the colonel has given us an excellent discourse and very much opened my eyes  i must own said sir john we are a little too divided and make great drawbacks on our real happiness yet perhaps this sort of conduct poises the scale of liberty and prevents power and ambition destroying the equilibre      mr conyers examined the plan of france as laid down by mr villeneuf in which he made many alterations and the next evenings conversation happening to turn on the subject of the last  i beg said he to be permitted to add a postscript to the colonels lecture and to carry you to the fountainhead of what i imagine the liberty of england  whoever continued he considers the dominions of france will imagine they ought not to think of enlarging their boundaries beyond the pyranees the alps and the rhine as such conquests would be rather expensive than serviceable  their views with regard to commerce have always been traversed by england and holland  the forces they constantly keep up prevent their being disturbed by their neighbors on the continent  by the vast sums they employ in foreign courts besides their known subsidies they fortify themselves with the strongest alliances  as they have nothing to fear at home they have but one thing to wish for abroad to accomplish all their schemes  could the austrian netherland be annexed to france the grand project would execute itself  for this essential conquest treasures must be hoarded troops must be maintained and no expense spared when this finishing blow can be once struck france need not desire universal monarchy  if she now maintains three hundred thousand men she will then content herself with a quarter of that number  when mistress of the ten provinces of flanders the dutch must act as she shall direct  when assured no war can disturb her frontiers what vessels will she not build  how many thousands will then be employed at sea and who will she have to oppose her but england  their whole force will then be centered on the ocean  cast your eyes on the map of europe  will she not then have the whole coast from ostend to st jean de luz besides that in the mediterranean  she may then without aiming at universal monarchy guide direct and give laws to every state in europe free from the trouble of being sovereign of it  what would her glory be to have monarchs for her vassals  it is next to a mathematical demonstration that this is the favorite project of france lewis the fourteenth attempted it and became formidable at sea even to the united fleets of england and holland great and mighty as they were  in all human probability lewis had seen the end of his wishes had not king william and queen anne gloriously interposed and saved europe they cut him out such warm work on the continent and obliged him so to waste the blood and treasure of his people that his sinews at last relaxed his darling marine was neglected and his whole force became little enough to defend the heart of his kingdom  if what i have said be not critically the views of france they have certainly schemes of some affinity to it  in the present war they practiced another method to arrive at the same end  they attacked the empire  could they have cut off the head they knew the limbs would fall of course  such gentlemen i apprehend is the fundamental maxim of france  to traverse and frustrate such a pernicious project half our blood and treasure would be a cheap purchase  our annals are sanguind with the blood of britons slaughtered by brother britains  they show the horrid devastation of civil war  they point out the bloody fields in england scotland and ireland  wherefore all this but to establish and preserve us in that liberty we so happily enjoy but of which some make unworthy use  if we have fought with dethroned and put our own monarchs to death for infringing on our liberties what should we not do to avoid servility being imposed on us by foreign tyranny ultima ratio regum is the motto of french cannon  if that be the last argument of the most christian monarch certainly it is our duty and business as perfectly to understand that logic  nothing is so dangerous as to contemn an enemy and nothing is so idle and vain as to despise and abuse the french  on the contrary we ought and we have reason to dread their power  their situation and their politics  if we mean to hand down to our posterity pure and undefiled that sacred liberty purchased by our ancestors let us rouse our spirits let us unite and act like them  but if we mean to suffer that holy light to be extinguished  to perish with our own frail bodies let us not only disband our trivial land but likewise our mighty naval forces for except our utmost strength be collected and the designs of france rendered abortive the one will be useless at home and i will venture to prophesy the other will soon be overmatchd abroad  i shall conclude with the words of king william which ought to be engraven on the hearts of every true englishman  let me conjure you said that glorious monarch to disappoint the only hopes of our enemies by your unanimity i have shown and will always show how desirous i am to be the common father of all my people do you in like manner lay aside parties and divisions let there be no other distinction heard of amongst us for the future but of those who are for the protestant religion and the present establishment and of those who mean a popish prince and a french government  it is not easy to paint the serious countenances of the company the colonel lifted up his eyes sir john and squire ash shook their heads the doctor cried lord have mercy upon us but mr leatherhead was so affected that he let fall his pipe and seemed to neglect his favorite tankard      the conversation was on various subjects and at last fell on the laws of england  the colonel owned they were wise and wholesome but declared that the vast delay and chicanerie of the practitioners was the greatest burden a nation could groan under  speedy justice said mr conyers is the spirit and essence of laws both civil and criminal a french author of humor observes that the english are infinitely more tenacious of their properties than their lives for says he life or death is generally decided in twentyfour hours but property be it ever so trivial may employ as many years  mr conyers was proceeding on the subject when the terror of the poor in the shape of john clinch the constable entered the room  please your worships said he ant please you there is moll stevens has gotten her belly up and so ant please your worships as the wench lays the matter on paddy murphy the irish drawer below stairs i thoughten best to bring her before your worships that she might swear it for please your worships that irish dog does a power of mischief in the parish  why friend said the colonel we do not meet here for business but however let her come up  when the constable withdrew  give me leave gentlemen said the doctor to examine this affair and to beg of you to do exactly like me for i want to try an experiment  they promised and then entered the constable moll stevens paddy murphy the master and mistress of the house and most of the servants  the staffofficer produced the bible and very learnedly began to open the cause but the doctor stopped him saying pray friend hold your peace you have nothing to say in the affair and i charge you all to keep silence  come hither young woman said he dont tremble  we shall do you no harm  you are here to swear to the person who has greatly injured you in your reputation and brought you into some disgrace  do you know child the nature of an oath  poor molly stevens with downcast looks and faultering tongue answered  yes  consider young woman said the doctor that an oath is the only security between man and man  consider that an oath is a solemn affirmation in the presence of almighty god that what we speak is the truth and stake our precious souls on it  consider the situation you are now in and that you must very speedily be put to a trial where your life will be in danger  to swear falsely and perhaps in a few days be called to judgment is a thought that should make every creature tremble  consider seriously my child that god will punish sinners therefore be certain of the truth and do not rashly risk your soul and add a crime of the blackest dye to the crime that by repentance god almighty may forgive  be resolute and say the truth  tears flowed very plentifully down poor mollys cheeks but the doctor taking off his hat and kneeling down all the company did the same  in this posture he gave her the book and administered the oath in the most solemn manner and then rose up  now child said he you are bound to answer with truth  is this young man whose name is patrick murphy the father of the child you now go with or not  with many sobbs and tears she at last answered  no  who then said he is the father of it  she hesitated for some time and with great difficulty answered  john clinch  who was it said the doctor that did advise and would have persuaded you to swear falsely against patrick murphy she answered  john clinch  very well said he your affair is finished  but for you mr constable it is my orders that you find good security by tomorrow morning for the maintenance of the child and that you immediately pay one guinea to patrick murphy or i will have you indicted for subornation of perjury  the constable though vastly confounded had so much wit that he paid his fine and the extra company withdrew triumphing with murphy and applauding the wisdom of the parson  doctor said the colonel i wish you joy for if perjury be a damning sin you have certainly for this bout saved one poor soul  i have often thought replied the doctor that we have not only multiplied oaths and made them familiar but that our common way of administering them is an inlet to the greatest of evils and sincerely wish that all justices of the peace and other magistrates would see it performed in a more decent and christianlike manner  well well said mr leatherhead thoff john clinch be to father the child i believe irish paddy has had a finger in the pie  the son of a wh  re has a most swinging brogue and the girls begin with laughing but he makes some of them cry for all that the fellow makes love to my wifes maid and i have a letter of hisn in my pocket  come said the colonel now for an irish billetdoux  my deer sowl what signifis making an orasion and palavar for your one sweet self nos how despratly i am in love with you my poor is karryd the arrant oftin enuf and your one deer fese was after givin me a sivil anser for you simpurd upon me and made my poor heart gump for joy now thees fuu lines is to ashure my deer charmin sally that if she pleses to let me have a small confablation i will ley my heart and sowl at her feet and you may command me by nite or by dey for the precent time or my hole life if you break my poor heart i will love you and when i am in my cowld greve my ghost will attind you and do you all the sarvis i can ogh my deer sally keep my heart allive and you will find it beter then all the gosts in england no more at precent from your fethful and dyin  patrick murphy   well said paddy cried the colonel i assure you the young rogue has got the laconick style and says a great deal in few words in spite of the brogue on his pen you find he comes to the point and very likely will carry it  that he will not replied mr leatherhead for the girl hates him and abuses him all day long  and yet said sir john she may love him all night  there have been such tricks  i am in love said mr conyers with this irish epistle but i have one from a shoemaker in london to my farmer tom driver whose son is his apprentice as it is a sample of low londonshire english i beg leave to read it  dear friend these few lines is to acquaint you that your son tom is in good health at this present writing and begins to handle his hammer to some tune so that i hopes he will be a clever feller he was in a strange quandery at the many fokes in this city but that matter is now all off i will say that for him he is the most biggest boy i ever see ofs age and as strong as a bruser he fit will adz the coopers boy and soundly thrashd his jackett he plays a rare knife and fork but cannot eat weeal without weeneger but he is very fond of a few broth the poor lad had a mishap last week for he fell out at wynder and broke his head against the stone postisses i find he looks hard at the wenches so i fears he will not be a batchelder at the end ofs time our friend mr tabby the staymaker is now a wyder no more from  your loving friend toby lift   i dont see said mr leatherhead why we should laugh at the shoemaker because he dont write so fine as a parson thoff he dont he writes well enough and he is an englishman but what a plague have we to do with a parcel of irish who take the bread out of our mouths and debauch all our women why dont we transport em back to their bogs and potatos i am sure twould be happy for us if ireland was at the bottom of the sea  no no said sir john not that neither but i think we ought to give them no trade and make them pay some of our taxes  thats an odd maxim sir john said the colonel  now i should think that the best way to make them pay some of our taxes is to put them in a condition to do it  should we keep them poor we may lay on taxes but how shall we collect them  where shall we find the money  i shall not said the doctor reason on the prudence or justice of england because though mr leatherhead forgets it i was born in ireland and might be suspected of partiality but mr conyers has a letter with some account of that kingdom which i own gave me great pleasure because i sincerely love great britain and honor the king  the account said mr conyers that the doctor has mentioned is a copy of a letter from an english gentleman to a noble lord which fell into my hands by accident if you think proper it shall make part of our entertainment at next meeting      the reader will please to remember that mr villeneuf gave jack a paper relating to ireland this paper mr conyers altered and threw into the shape of the following letter which he read in his place  dublin    march      my lord i have now finished my tour through this kingdom in my former letters i gave your lordship some account of cities and towns but rather as a journal of my travels than a regular description of the country i purpose now to speak of the kingdom in general and hope i have so much conquered my former unaccountable prejudices as to be able to give your lordship a short but true idea of ireland  it is of little moment to argue whether this country is claimed by england as a conquest or whether the inhabitants threw themselves under its protection  that the irish fought against queen elizabeth and were often in arms till entirely subdued by king william is a matter not to be wondered at when we consider their religion  erroneous as their principles were they certainly acted agreeable to them  no doubt the resistance they made and the blood they shed struck that sort of horror and hatred in our ancestors that is handed down to their posterity and makes at this day part of our character  when we speak of the people we ought carefully to make a distinction between irish and irish that is we ought to regard the protestants of ireland as ourselves because in fact they are our brethren and our children and so to manage the poor natives who are mostly papists that by clemency and good usage we may wean them from ill habits and make them faithful and useful subjects  the settlements of our ancestors in this kingdom and the number of english that are daily fixing themselves in the law the church the army and in civil employments must in time make it a protestant country and of the highest importance to great britain  an acquisition of three millions of subjects and above ten millions of good acres is not so trivial an affair as some imagine  if we have conquered this kingdom who enjoys the conquest but the descendants of the english  if true policy requires lenity and encouragement to the conquered undoubtedly the conquerors who settled on the spot have at least the same title  wherefore did we conquer but to establish our laws our religion our manners and our liberty amongst a people who greatly wanted all and to add strength and luster to the throne of england  it is true my lord we are masters of this kingdom but i am afraid we do not reap a tenth of the advantages it might procure us  our whole conduct favors too much of monopoly we argue from wrong principles for every individual regardless of every other measures the happiness of the kingdom but by his own private interest  thus a clothing town complains dreadfully of the decay of its trade without considering how much it increases in another  bristol is much out of humor that the african and slave trade is so considerably fallen but bristol forgets to inform us how greatly it flourishes at liverpool  provided trade exists it is indifferent to us as a nation where it fixes but i apprehend the more places it inhabits the greater the chance for its increasing  with regard to the kingdom i applaud our wisdom in promoting and encouraging their linen manufacture  their industry has brought this branch to infinite perfection which alone enables them to pay so great a tax to england as twelve hundred thousand pounds a year  your lordship will be surprised at my mentioning a tax  if the express letter will not allow of the term the real fact will justify it  the pensions and employments on this establishment the large fortunes spent in england the great importation of english commodities with other articles that are exactly computed will amount to that sum if not to more  did they want this linen trade england would want so much clear profit and silesia hamburgh and holland enjoy the sweets your lordship therefore perceives how much it is the interest of england to cherish and countenance this branch should we neglect or clog it by partial views or unseasonable parsimony we should irrecoverably lose a mine more valuable than that of gold whilst we favor ireland in this it is but just and right we would be equally kind to our brethren of scotland the field is wide enough for both and both ought to be supported by every bounty we can bestow  what laws have we not made what expense have we not been at to prevent the exportation of irish wool into foreign nations  has it answered the end proposed  i am sure it has not  the natural consequence of our prohibition is that they send it by stealth into france where they have a certain vent  is this clandestine trade practiced in england  i fear your lordship cannot answer in the negative  ireland could do extremely well without french wines but i know not the inconveniences france would be drove to had she not their beef their tallow hides and butter but when we add wool the irish have a profit in that commodity the french have a vast gain but the english are as certainly vast losers  were your lordship to examine strictly into the truth you would find that the grand contest is not so much between england and ireland but between england and france your lordship would then discover that every link we throw out to bind ireland not only curtails their profits but our own and what is worse transferring those profits into the arms of france  was this matter seriously considered and it is worth the thoughts of the wisest amongst us abbeville would soon be a desert and the french obliged to recur to the old method of buying our stuffs  and here my lord permit me to lay open a piece of french conduct which is not generally known abbeville is a royal manufacture to support which wool must be obtained from england and ireland at any price but the manufacturers pay only the middle price of england and the king that is the kingdom in general pays the remainder by this method and by the cheapness of provisions they are able to undersell us in foreign markets  amongst the many schemes for restraining irish wool i have met but with one that in any degree can answer the end  the author proposes a large bounty on the exportation of corn from ireland  this says he would certainly throw the inhabitants into tillage and soon convert their sheep walks into corn fields and all the people would be properly employed and supported  were your lordship to view the southern and western coasts of this kingdom you would be as much charmed with their bays and harbors as astonished to find them of such little use  little to themselves but less to england  were it possible to convince gentlemen that let the riches of ireland be what it will nine tenths would certainly center in england i imagine they could not hesitate a moment but by endeavoring to increase it at the expense of our enemies enable them at last to bear a proportion and to contribute to the exigencies of the british government  the common opinion of the laziness of the irish is not strictly just the negroes in america have certainly more comfortable dwellings and are better fed than the poor natives of this country they are strangers to property as well as meat with what spirit would an english plowman work under such circumstances  i fancy not much better than the irish  if these poor people are slothful and inactive their food will account for it on the same principles that sir william temple accounts for the peculiar courage of the english  no doubt my lord but good nourishment good clothes and decent habitations greatly influence the constitution of a man and give a labourer that vigor and life so necessary to his employment  your lordship may ask why it is not so in ireland  the error i think lies in the generality of the landlords here a man of large fortune never sees his estate and will not be troubled with a multiplicity of tenants  he lets the whole to a few gentlemen  these let their parts to others reserving a certain revenue to themselves  these again do the same in a lower degree till by passing through a dozen or twenty hands it sinks the real occupiers into downright misery and wretchedness  as a man of some humanity and tenderness for my fellow creatures i most heartily wish i could as easily point out the remedy as show the disease  notwithstanding their own capital errors and many of ours they seem to struggle through difficulties with great resignation and patience they spare no pains to make it a protestant kingdom and most vigorously follow the plan laid down at a vast expense by dr henry maul now bishop of mead in educating the children of the natives in labor industry and true religion already have they reclaimed thousands of unhappy creatures and added them to the stock of faithful subjects  if the romans granted a civic crown to him who saved one citizen what triumphs what statues does not this truly right reverend prelate deserve for preserving such multitudes  the reward of this world can be but praise the just recompense can only be given in the other  i enclose to your lordship a full account of this most noble and useful charity now founded on a charter  one rational scheme produces others  their liberal subscriptions for encouraging husbandry arts manufactures and in short every branch of industry and useful knowledge betrays not an idle inactive spirit and the consequence is visible throughout the whole kingdom  i send your lordship a list of premiums for the present year add this to the account of the charter schools and they give such a proof of true wisdom and understanding that i am not able to cite any thing that even looks like a parallel  your lordship will not expect encomiums on the papists of this kingdom for their firm attachment to a protestant government no my lord but they are quiet and amenable to it as for the protestants i am convinced his majesty has not more loyal and faithful subjects  the ridicule on the irish tone or manner of speaking is rather more absurd than barbarous all nations have that folly  the parisians make very free with the normans gascoigns and other provinces  the people of rome banter the common venetian dialect  the saxons despise the tone of other german states  all germany laugh at the low dutch and the hollanders laugh as heartily at the flemings  each country in england make themselves merry at the expense of another but all england ridicule the scotch welsh and irish and these i suppose return the compliment  thus we have all the lucky faculty of finding perfection in ourselves and seeing the contrary in our neighbors  whatever might have been the reason for holding the irish in contempt even to hatred i can truly say those reasons must have long since ceased they are now members and very useful members to our body and are capable of being made infinitely more so they are not as some imagine a wen on the neck of england that disgraces our form and sucks up our natural juices no my lord but as it certainly is in our power to make them so it is as certain that we may and ought to render them a strength and a support to the british government  i cannot let slip an opportunity of expressing my gratitude for the many civilities i have received in this country hospitality is their character indeed they a little exceed in the article of wine especially in brimmers to the cause of liberty and our happy constitution their zeal is so fervent that they forget that the wine they drink is of that country that would destroy both  let us my lord avoid all invidious names and distinctions and rank them amongst the errors of the vulgar let us be just and faithful to each other let us learn truth wisdom and honor these are not confined to the torrid or frigid zone neither can temperate regions boast their peculiar residence  i am with the greatest respect my lord etc   chap x where where degenerate countrymen  how high will your fond folly and your madness fly are scenes of death and servile chains so dear to sue for blood and bondage every year like rebel jews with too much freedom cursed to court a change  though certain of the worst garth i am afraid i have carried my reader too far from the subject matter of this history and tried his patience but i assure him that my indulgence has been very great for at infinite pains i have curtailed the last chapter at least sixty pages  few know the difficulty of bridling the imagination and reining back an hardmouthed pen it sometimes gets ahead and in spite of all our skill runs away with us into mire and dirt nay this minute i find my quill in a humor to gallop so shall stop him short in time  thus we have seen the agreeable manner mr conyers passed away many evenings and thus did he establish himself in the affections of his company and in the love of the inhabitants by many acts of generous charity colonel manly in particular held him in great esteem and carried his friendship so far as to promise his interest with the borough for a seat in parliament on the first vacancy  mr conyers had now experienced perfect happiness for above a year  he knew the great secret of enjoying the good things of this world so as not to abuse them  his fortune his faithful and agreeable companion his family and the love and respect of all were the rewards of his honest intentions to all mankind in a word the elements in him were so mixed that he deserved the honorable title of a man  but this world is not made for permanent and lasting joys  his happiness tranquillity and every domestic pleasure vanished in a moment and left him as awakened out of a dream of bliss  he had a prospect of an increase to his happiness but the disappointment added to his pains  mrs conyers was near lyingin but an ignorant servant maid telling her a most frightful story of the rebellion which had just then broke out threw her into a fit and violent tremor which brought on an improper labor she was delivered of a boy who died soon after and in four days the kind the tender the affectionate and agreeable mrs conyers followed her child  the distraction and real grief of the family and their friends is not to be expressed mr conyers bore this dreadful stroke like a man but he felt it like a man his exclamations were few but his sighs and the throbbings of his heart were without number his inky coat was not the only sign of sorrow the involuntary tear the heavings of his breast and the alteration of his countenance gave visible marks of sincere affliction  let me at once quit the melancholy subject and bring my friend to a state of mind a little more composed and resigned  he assured mr and mrs sampson of his constant affection and love and that notwithstanding his dearest wife had made no will he knew her intention and would fulfill it accordingly new writings were drawn and he made them a compliment of three thousand pounds  his gloomy countenance would have had a much longer duration had not the rebellion roused his indignation he thought his duty to his sovereign called him from inaction and the love of his country seemed prior to every other regard to bestow hard names on rebels and supinely to sigh at intestine war he judged was unmanly and imprudent he had no idea that the choice of liberty or slavery required a moments hesitation full of freedom and glory he unbosomd his thoughts to the colonel  my dear friend said this venerable but hearty old gentleman i must love you the more for this  yes my dear conyers go  fight for your country and god almighty preserve and give you victory  did my great age permit i would be your companion and share in the danger  i well remember though then a boy the insolence of a popish government i remember the seven bishops in the tower  the swarms of friars in st jamess park  the sham liberty of conscience and a thousand other enormities  young as i was i followed my father and joined the prince of orange  i fought and bled for him and liberty at the boyne  i fought for liberty and king george at dumblain and what man who has a soul and a sense of our invaluable blessings but would venture nay lay down his life for them  now i am old and infirm but my heart is good  indeed it is  the poor gentleman could proceed no farther for tears choked his words mr conyers was greatly affected and said all in his power to ease the colonels heart  you must forgive said the colonel the weakness of an old man  i cannot help it  but when i think on times past  on the danger our constitution has so often been in and the noble and successful struggles we have made to defend it  when i think on these things my pulse forgets its age and beats as strong as in youth  good god  what is it we want  is there a reasonable blessing that we do not or may not enjoy  are we blind to our own happiness and can some who call themselves protestants even think of a popish king but with horror  can we be so stupid as not to see the old the stale trick of france and must some of us always fall into so weak a project  poor deluded men but thank god we have still honor and wisdom sufficient to convince them of their errors  from my soul i wish it replied mr conyers neither have i the least doubt  for my part i am determined and will immediately prepare for the field  i believe said the colonel i can assist you  let me see  ay  i have a tent and every campnecessary in good order for i frequently visit them to refresh my memory  these are yours with two excellent baggage horses and a bawman that understands his business  dear sir said mr conyers you have made me quite happy  i am already in the field  softly softly answered the colonel perhaps i may do somewhat more i would not have you go with irregulars for it will not be so satisfactory  a noble duke is about raising a regiment of horse  he does me the honor to rank me with his intimate friends and i will immediately send an express and write him such a letter that perhaps shall put you in a light of honor and enable you to be really useful  mr conyers returned him many thanks and he was exact to his promise  we must now said the colonel think of engaging a few good volunteers to accompany you to the regiment in case you succeed we must be busy and go roundly to work  in a few days they fixed on twenty young fellows mostly sons of tenants  in a short time the colonel received a most polite and obliging answer to his letter it concluded  from the great character you give mr conyers he cannot fail of being extremely agreeable i am sorry i have but a lieutenancy to offer him should this be accepted of i beg an answer by express and that he would join the regiment at  with all speed with whatever good men he can pick up  lieutenant conyers said the colonel i most heartily wish you joy  now indeed matters put on a better face and you are equipped as you ought to be  but bustle bustle  take leave of the good people at home make your will and  to horse and away  taking leave was a task he could wish to be excused but it was impossible mr sampson was struck dumb at the news but his good wife lost all patience she could not comprehend the necessity of his going in person when he might by deputy she quoted many examples of gentlemen of fortunes infinitely superior to his who contented themselves with paying a little money and drinking success to the cause  yes yes my dear said her husband they must be special good subjects who are only warm in the cause by the quantity of liquor they drink i violently suspect such sort of people and am not sorry to find my dear brother of another way of thinking i am only concerned that such an unhappy occasion should deprive us of his company and throw him into danger but i trust in god he will return in safety and with victory  if he must go replied mrs sampson i pray god to protect and shield him  the conversation became more familiar and by degrees he persuaded them to excuse the ceremony of parting which would give pain and make him miserable  with all imaginable diligence he prepared for his departure he sent forward twentythree recruits under the care of two of his tenants he left a will with dr grace and a power with mr sampson to receive his rents and remitted five hundred pounds to the agent of the regiment that he might draw on him as occasions required he concerted matters with the colonel and his horses and baggage filed off by degrees to the next town he invited some friends to dinner the next day which was sunday so the family was sure of him for one meal more however whilst they were at church the colonel called in his chariot and accompanied him where the horses attended the old gentleman gave him a proper letter to his grace and stayed with him that night in the morning he took a soldierlike farewell saw him set out for the regiment and returned in the evening to give mr sampson an account of their expedition  chap xi since great examples justify command let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire and catch from breast to breast the noble fire popes homer our lieutenant soon arrived at the appointed place and found his recruits in good order he was received with great politeness and presented with his commission and to all his brotherofficers the regiment was near complete and only waited the generals orders to march where the service required he was extremely pleased with this new society as he found the officers were not only gentlemen of good sense but of considerable fortunes he readily joined in every expense that was proposed to make the regiment live comfortably and do honor to the cause  in about three weeks he received a letter from colonel manly with some books the letter is so concise and so full of good instruction that i cannot avoid giving it a place verbatim  my very dear friend i take this first opportunity of fulfilling my promise by laying before you what my age and experience judge necessary for your welldoing  you are a man of property and now enlisted to fight the cause of freedom and of that monarch who has ever supported it  you are a soldier you are one of those on whom under god the life and liberty of this nation depend  consider the dignity of your station  consider the mighty trust reposed in you consider yourself and it is scarcely possible you will err in your conduct  i am positive as to your personal courage for your soul is humane and tender and your tongue is not a bragart but as your behavior in this new scene of life is what i am not so certain of your goodnature will excuse a little advice and attribute my trite maxims more to the warmth of my friendship than to any occasion you may have for them  to be an officer there is no necessity of being inspired with supernatural talents common sense and the deportment of a gentleman are sufficient the knowledge of your duty and the military art will come with time and experience but a close application to the study is necessary  the love of the soldiers is the happiness of an officer and to gain that love the method is short and easy  pay and punish where due but never strike  be free with your men but suffer them not to be too free with you an haughty overbearing temper may indeed inspire them with fear but never with affection treat them as men and they will respect you as their officer but at the same time be careful that the noncommissiond officers act in the same manner and support their proper authority on which all duty and submission depends  endeavor as much as possible to keep your men clean and decent it gives spirits and prevents drunkenness and debauchery  drop in at their meals taste their victuals encourage them to keep good messes and reprove where you find them remiss  be assiduous to learn the exercise of a soldier and keep your men diligent at it yet so as not to fatigue them unnecessarily see that they punctually obey your commands but be not too rigorous in trivial matters believe me the men soon find out the genius of their officers and will never impose or play tricks when they know they cannot do it with impunity  make it a constant rule to obey with alacrity and cheerfulness every order of your superiors such a conduct will add to your reputation and confirm your character  slander and scandal sometimes insinuate themselves into camps and too frequently attack the most deserving let me beg of you to turn the deaf ear to evil report and not be speedily prejudiced against any man much less your commanders  if an officer need not have all the wisdom of a privycounsellor he ought at least to have that part that enjoins secrecy the spanish proverb is good  in a closed mouth no flies enter  execute your orders in silence and let not the most distant hint of the conduct of the army escape from your lips or your pen should you know nothing particular your words must be mere conjecture and in all probability quite wrong should a material circumstance come to your knowledge what infamy must follow your disclosing it  company and cheerfulness are absolutely necessary but to drink to excess is inexcusable the lives of thousands depend on the sobriety of officers  how can a drunkard guide men truly when his own legs mutiny and refuse his commands  be charitable be generous according to your power but seldom give money to a soldier when you think proper to reward or encourage there are other ways infinitely more useful to them  rise early and examine your command keep them reasonably employed and under the strictest discipline but let your own example keep pace with your precepts have all your affairs in so nice and exact an order as to be always ready to march at a moments warning all men ought to accustom themselves to regularity but none requires it more than a soldier  your natural good temper will prevent your giving offense to any one and perhaps incline you to bear patiently those offered to you but have a care and let what will be the consequence permit no man to taunt or insult  should the least particle of contempt fall on you quit a service where you must do more harm than good  with regard to your present enemies hold them not too cheap  speak of them as men of an unhappy education led away by false maxims and prejudiced to erroneous principles they are or ought to be our brethren  let your humanity extend to them as far as safety and prudence will permit if absolute and fatal necessity compels you to strike let the sword fall from no other motive but the general good  let it be effectual but instant  in that unhappy case drive every womanish weakness from your heart and consider that too much lenity and tenderness may be cruelty to your country  the action or necessary pursuit over let clemency and compassion fill your breast  should you conquer be all mildness and charity  comfort the prisoner assist the wretched wounded speak peace to despairing souls and if possible show them the joys of freedom and liberty  but i have done and discharged the office annexed to love and friendship if my hints are useless to you perhaps you may know those to whom they may be of service  i send you my old faithful companion monsieur de feuquiere read him carefully for he is able to instruct i likewise send you polibius with the annotations of monsieur de follard  you find i am an old fellow by my longwinded tale but i shall appear more so when you consider i end where i ought to have begun by recommending to you the service of god and obedience to his ordinances a righteous and a godly life is the best preparative for death though all ought yet none should be more ready to obey that call than a soldier  his life is every instant in a peculiar manner at stake  think on this frequently and your duty to god and man will certainly follow and man and the almighty will reward you with peace content and happiness  into his hands i resign you and most fervently pray him to crown your cause with victory and to continue his mercy to this land to latest posterity  i am my dear conyers your very affectionate and very faithful servant josiah manly   mr conyers was greatly pleased at the sincerity and goodness of the colonel he read his letter many times and compared it with the instructions of mr kindly with a determined resolution of adhering to both as far as he was able he read feuquiere and polibius with pleasure but monsieur de la colonie and the maxims of turenne afforded equal instruction and delight  chap xii whither oh whither do you madly run the sword unsheathed and impious war begun what land what wave of boundless neptunes flood has not been stained alas with british blood not that the rival to the british fame proud france might tremble at the british name not that iberia though unskilled in war in chains should follow our triumphal car but that romes pontiff should his vow enjoy and britain suicide herself destroy franciss  th epode of horace altered why should i take up the time of the reader by going minutely into the conduct of the rebels or our own my task is only relative to the private character of jack connor or mr conyers a lawyer only speaks from his brief and in all those pages on which this history is founded i find little or no traces of the actions of the times  i own i met with a paper that i suppose served as memorandums and hints to mr conyers it was dated like a journal but gave me little insight into affairs i find the words  they slipped by  we marched to  missed again  slipped again  men much harrassd  vastly obliged to london subscription  the inhabitants of  deserve encouragement but the city of  to be burnt  thank god we have got our troops from flanders  the duke to command  our people in great spirits  victory or death  then followed in capital letters culloden   th april      they were weighed in the balance and found light  when he reflected on the happy consequences of the glorious day  when he considered that freedom liberty religion and his majestys august family were more firmly established and confirmed to great britain  that a full period was put to blood and slaughter and to that unnatural monster civil war his heart exulted and his joy was extreme  he very devoutly returned his acknowledgments to that providence which had so often and so signally preserved our invaluable privileges and had protected him in the midst of so many dangers  he wrote a particular account of this battle to mr sampson and colonel manly he vastly extolled the skill and judgment of the general and the valor of the troops in his letter to the colonel he has these remarkable words  i think i see all england in a joy next to madness all admire the conduct and intrepidity of his royal highness they cannot now find words sufficient to express their praises but of you who know the national infirmity give me leave to ask how long will this last  will they not soon be equally eager to strip him of his laurels  will not envy malice and disaffection soon endeavor to poison the minds of the people and blast the reputation of him who risqued his own to preserve their lives and properties  i fear he must expect such treatment i doubt our gratitude and most heartily wish for the honor of the kingdom that i may be deceived this war and the danger of it is over consequently the instruments of safety will soon be sacrificed to the parsimony of their purse and every disbanded soldier exposed to the insults of every peasant  for my own part i so much admire the military virtues of my leader he shall command my hand and my heart wherever and as long as he judges proper  he greatly commiserated the unfortunate prisoners now subject to the injured laws of their country to avert the punishment due to such crimes was not in his power but to make them easy and alleviate their sorrows was his daily employment  he laid no stress on victory as it is an uncertain determination of right or wrong but he argued in the gentlest terms and endeavored to convince them from history reason and experience that their prejudices were ill founded  that they were dupes to the politics of france and acted like children who disobey the best of parents  that as criminal as they were his majesty was clothed with mercy and advised an immediate application to his clemency  he showed them the goodness of the late king in      and very judiciously referred them to the memoirs of marchal villars and many other french books for the opposite conduct of lewis the fourteenth to his protestant subjects in the cevennes who had taken arms merely to defend their religion not to dethrone their monarch  such a conduct made mr conyers vastly beloved and brought some who were violent to think with more moderation he greatly pitied the poor clans as they were bred up in a blind and implicit obedience to their chiefs he lamented those gentlemen who acted from conscience and principle but regarded those as the most wicked of human beings whose only motive was to fish in troubled waters  not content with this sort of behavior he endeavored to remove our own prejudices and take off that acrimony and ill nature which some of us are too subject to  he proved the injustice and cruelty of branding a whole kingdom for the faults of a few that even those few were fallen brethren and erred in their duty but from their zeal to mistaken opinions that most of them deserved our pity more than our anger that so far from perpetuating animosity all encouragement and regard should be shown to the good and every scheme set on foot to convert the bad  time and proper management would convince every mortal that as a union of minds was our reciprocal interest so love and friendship would soon make us the affectionate children of an indulgent parent  happy thrice happy should we be if every man reasoned like mr conyers  division and envy and malice and madness would cease to distract and confound the real beauty and harmony of our most excellent constitution  were our souls cemented by love tenderness and charity  did we take half the pains to assist as we do to destroy each other what joys would not this land afford  with what respect would foreign nations behold us  what terror to our enemies and to the disturbers of europe  chap xiii quoth hudibras the case is clear as thou have proved it by their practice no argument like matter of fact is and we are best of all led to mens principles by what they do hudibras certainly it is almost time to proceed to the personal account of lieutenant conyers but i must crave a little indulgence for the following chapter and shall then follow him more closely  amongst the manuscripts so often mentioned i found one relative to the unhappy subject of last chapter i suppose mr conyers had seen some of the declarations published by the son of the pretender which induced him to form one by way of parody and by taking off the mask show the picture in a full and just light  whether this piece was published or not i cannot learn but to omit it in this its proper place would be unpardonable in a faithful historian to which honorable title i hope i have a right  the paper runs thus  the declaration of  by command of our r  l f  the divine permission of his holiness the pope the assistance of his most christian and the good wishes of his most catholic majesty aided and supported by the alms and prayers of all true sons of the church we send this our declaration to the people of england greeting you must be all convinced that the unhappy fate of our grandfather king james the second of glorious and pious memory was owing to the infidelity and cowardice of his fleets and armies  as your cowardice and infidelity were the ruin and subversion of our august house we trust hat the same principles are capable of restoring us to the throne of our ancestors  to obviate every difficulty to these our just and laudable purposes we shall by the authority aforesaid convince this nation that our rule will be salutary and extend to the happiness of every individual  the riot and habeas corpus acts are equally dangerous and shall with the advice of friends be abrogated or suspended until a regulation can be made and the holy inquisition introduced into the kingdom  as the grand and petty juries are the greatest evils of civil government they shall be abolished and the judges whom we shall think proper to appoint shall finally hear and determine all criminal causes  processes in civil affairs are most shamefully and abominably abused the decision of property as now managed is a matter that greatly affects our humane heart and until a proper method can be fixed on for abridging the laws we shall take the contested lands or property into our care and guardianship  the insufficiency of the statute and common law of england absolutely require an explaining and a dispensing power we shall therefore once more establish a star chambercourt in its fullest extent  the many evils arising from clandestine marriages is a scandal to the nation and ruin to many thousand families to remedy which we shall immediately erect a court of wards as in the days of our illustrious ancestors  the education of youth is a matter of the highest importance our vigilance shall watch over those mighty seminaries oxford and cambridge their learning is too crampt and confined but by the assistance of mandamuses we shall throw in such fellow laborers from the sorbonne and st omers as will soon inculcate our grand design  liberty is the greatest blessing man can enjoy but the abuse of that liberty the greatest curse to avoid the latter and yet keep strictly to the former it is our sincere and determined resoluion to indulge every man in the peaceable and quiet liberty of thinking nevertheless though we would show our great moderation and lenity our true intent and meaning is that should any person presume to do more than merely think he shall not only incur our highest displeasure but be delivered to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction over whom we do not pretend to have any power consequently the door of our natural clemency will be shut against him  from our unbounded charity to weak and tender minds and in imitation of our illustrious grandfather of blessed memory it is our firm resolution to grant a plenary indulgence and full liberty of conscience to all sects and religions whatsoever that they shall exercise and enjoy all their respective rites and ceremonies in the amplest manner until the true and infallible church has taken root and spread its branches but no longer  the liberty of the press is an abomination in the sight of god and man such power in the hands of unbelievers and heretics gave rise to vile writings and infinity of blasphemies against the most highest nay it has dared to open its mouth against the majesty of kings  to contemn and make odious that great bulwark of monarchy the ancient system of divine hereditary and indefeasible right of princes and potentates  to stir up the rabble against that mild and peaceable doctrine of nonresistance and passive obedience  to undermine all the ordinances of our holy mother church  to reproach us with idolatry cruelty and superstition and above all it has been so wicked to set before the vulgar and ignorant the whole works of the prophets and apostles without the aid of hebrew or greek to the great discouragement of learning and increase of impiety  from a thorough conviction of such horrid practices we shall in due time commission thirty of our most able ecclesiastics to read and examine all manuscripts and license such only to be printed which they shall judge for the honor of god or our own benefit  as no true son of the church can with patience hear of the havoc and devastation the house of tudor made of her lands and revenues nor of the many robberies and impieties committed in those barbarous times against the holy see and the cloistered saints whom god had so plentifully scattered over the land our pious intention is so soon as affairs will permit to reinstate our holy mother church into those lands and revenues granted her by the charity of good christians  by the account furnished us by our holy father it is with the greatest joy we find that we shall be enabled to present to the laborers in the vineyard of god a comfortable and reasonable subsistence though it but a little exceeds two thirds of the lands of the kingdom  in fine let us conjure you by the duty you owe gods hereditary vicegerent by the love of peace and tranquillity and by the honor of our supreme and infallible judge to hear and consider these our real and sincere purposes stripped of any the least disguise  consider our situation  regard our sword  consider that the most christian king is our support the most catholic our helper and those in the mountains assertors of our right  let therefore no unsanctifyd bishop preach you from your duty but remember the happiness the mighty happiness we intend to bestow upon you and be assured on the faith of a family who never forfeited their word  on the faith of a family whose virtues and heroic deeds are so fully recorded in your histories that we shall not only strictly perform the several articles in this our gracious declaration but shall take all occasions and watch all opportunities of leading you more and more to a state of perfection here on earth and to a state of everlasting bliss in the world to come given at   chap xiv now by the foot the flying foot were slain horse trod by horse lay foaming on the plain from the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise shade the black host and intercept the skies the brasshoofd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound and the thick thunder beats the laboring ground popes homer  domestic peace was once more established and the late confused and distracted kingdom now more sensibly felt the joys of public tranquillity  the war with france still raged in flanders and required the presence of those troops which a rebellion had compelled to withdraw from their allies and the necessary orders were dispatched for embarking sundry corpse mr conyers was presented to a troop of dragoons under these orders he now equipt himself in a much better manner and was so employed that he had not time to visit his friends but contented himself with tender letters to mr sampson colonel manly and doctor grace  when the regiments were completed the final orders were given and captain conyers attended his duty  he certainly observed a profound silence on the military operations for i only found some orderly books written in his own hand which undoubtedly every officer ought to do  for the marches and encampments of the army i must refer to the gazettes of the time  as i ever consult the ease of my reader he will not condemn my silence when he considers i have no lights to guide either him or myself into affairs so much above our knowledge  however i must follow the glimmerings i have and pursue him through his variety of marches and foraging parties till i find him encamped near maestricht i must attend him in crossing the maese with the army and encamping in the vicinity of the french but even to the night before the last battle i have nothing particular to mention  this night indeed an affair happened which makes so material a part of this history that compels a recital though with my usual brevity  the captain had been ordered with detachments from other regiments on a command to venlo for forage disputes frequently happen on these occasions which the commanding officer must be extremely careful to prevent  by an officers insisting to be served out of his tour a quarrel began the clamor was great but the captain running to the spot exerted his authority and directed the forage in the proper channel the officer whose name was thornton and a lieutenant of dragoons was much out of humor and dropped some words as much as to say  captain conyers would not be always at the head of a command  the foraging being over they returned to maestricht where the captain found an order from the adjutantgeneral to join the army as speedily as possible after the men and horses were refreshed he communicated this order to the officers of the party and directed them to join at the port precisely at two oclock in the morning these orders were given to the men and he invited the officers to sup with him at the helmet and lieutenant thornton was of the party this gentleman was younger than captain conyers but in his size and many other respects extremely resembled him he had a very good character in the army but was too apt to imagine an affront where none was intended as he was well liked for many good qualities this fault was imputed to his youth and want of experience  lieutenant thomas was likewise of the company he was an elderly rough sort of a man who from a low station had by accident arrived to this rank he was educated and took his degrees in a stable and forgetful of the title he was honored with by his majestys commission swore and talked as if still a dragoon  this gentleman began the affair of the forage and seemed to think that lieutenant thornton had been injured  by the l  d said he if any man had served me so i would have shown him the difference  sir replied mr thornton i know as well as any man when i am ill used and shall take a proper time to explain myself  sir said the captain who began to be warm i dont know the meaning of all this but should you imagine any ill treatment i beg you will show the manner and you shall find me vastly ready to give you every satisfaction in my power  spoke cried thomas like a gentleman and a man of honor  sir said thornton since i must speak i must tell you i am a gentleman of family and fortune perhaps superior to your self you insulted me at venlo you stopped my men in their duty in a rude and uncivil manner this sir may injure my character and honor and calls for immediate satisfaction  thats right said thomas the present time is always the best therefore my advice is to take a cool turn on the parade and decide the matter like friends and men of honor  thornton rose up as did captain conyers  the rest of the company interposed and contrary to all mr thomass arguments obliged them to sit down in peace  the young lieutenant was on fire and the captain almost as hot but a little reflection brought him to his reason  gentlemen said the captain i am sorry for this affair and believe i can convince mr thornton of a mistaken point of honor  by the l  d said thomas your only best way is by the point of the sword  sir said the captain with a strong emphasis did i affront you too  no sir said thomas not me  then sir replied the other let me advise you as you regard your commission or your safety no more to interfere in our disputes  thomas bit his lips but prudently held his tongue  conyers turned to mr thornton and said  you have desired satisfaction sir and it is my duty to give it but permit me first to say i think you began at the wrong end what satisfaction could my life have afforded you or your death have given me your family or friends  i hope we have had time to reflect on the consequences of too precipitate a resolution  sir replied thornton the honor of an officer is a tender point  i confess it said the captain and therefore ought to be tenderly used  no satisfaction sir can equal a conviction of being in an error  here sir are the orders i received and submit to the gentlemen present if i exceeded them or showed the least partiality  the company agreed that he could not avoid acting as he did and he proceeded  as to your family and fortune they are in this case quite out of the question i own sir i was in an hurry to prevent a dispute but if any expressions of rudeness or incivility escaped from me i am sorry for it and before these gentlemen most heartily ask your pardon this sir i hope is the rational and just satisfaction one gentleman ought to ask of another if more is required i must comply though with reluctance  all the company except lieutenant thomas who was asleep cried out  no gentleman can desire more and greatly praised captain conyers  mr thornton confessed his error excused himself for his rashness and begged that no more might be said about it  the captain affectionately embracing him wished for an opportunity of showing his regard and friendship  what pity it is said he that trivial and insignificant words should raise our anger to the destruction of our peace and happiness and that incendiaries are not more severely punished  had not this good company been more prudent than two of us and honester than a third one might by this time have slept with his fathers and perhaps both  but come gentlemen let us prepare for duty where real honor calls let us fight with the common enemy but never amongst ourselves  one bottle more and then  and then said mr thornton have at the french  they finished two bottles with great harmony and often drank success to the duke and precisely at the time appointed marched out of maestricht and soon arrived at the camp  this proved a very busy day and made the small village of lawfeld famous  those who desire an account of the battle must not apply to me for my whole attention is taken up with capt conyers  when our dragoons were ordered to charge the captain did singular service he rescued his major and a lieutenant colonel of another regiment  he stopped several parties who were driving to their ruin and directed them where to turn their swords  his head and his hands were at work and in short as the french memoir writers phrase it he performed prodigies of valor  in the midst of this he saw lieutenant thornton with the greatest bravery waging unequal war for he was surrounded by three cavaliers  in an instant he flew to his relief and effectually took care of one by this time mr thornton was wounded in many places and on the ground the captain received a violent blow on his head and two wounds on his left shoulder his horse was shot but he manfully defended the body of his friend on foot finding the foe increased he desired quarters and resigned his sword to an officer who had just come up  at first he imagined mr thornton was killed but observing some signs of life he persuaded some of the french to carry him to a place of safety and was conducted along with him by the officer who was a gentleman of great humanity all possible care was taken of both and the action over they were sent to tongres with other prisoners  the gentleman to whom he had surrendered was the marquis de brissac colonel of a regiment of dragoons his politeness and good manners corresponded with his quality he daily visited the captain and procured him and mr thornton every necessary  the lieutenant had been severely treated having no less than seven wounds in the head shoulders and body two of them were dangerous but his youth and good constitution surmounted the difficulty in three weeks the surgeons declared him in a fair way of recovery but it would require great time  the marquis was extremely pleased and expressed himself very genteely on the occasion he assured him that assisting two such valiant gentlemen was the highest proof of his good fortune  though i was not said he a witness of your bravery i am sure it must have been great but the courage of the captain in defending you is what i shall ever esteem and admire him for to his valor you really owe your life more than to my endeavors to save it  as our two prisoners recovered their strength the marquis introduced them to the duke dayen with other officers of family and distinction and every politeness and respect was paid them  they had now their own servants and necessaries and a credit for money in two months capt conyers was in good health but his left arm was useless he got permission on his parole to go to his regiment but promised his friend to return soon and if possible go with him to aixlachapelle which was necessary for both  captain conyers was received with the greatest joy by his corpse and highly honored by his superiors he spoke of mr thornton in so noble a manner that the duke gave him a troop of dragoons and permission to both to go to aix or where they thought proper to establish their healths capt thornton was extremely sensible of the bounty and goodness of his royal highness and affectionately embracing conyers called him his father brother and preserver and vowed a perpetual friendship capt conyers was not behind hand and promised to attend him and if possible never to part  as soon as capt thornton was able to travel the friends took their leave of the marquis de brissac the duke dayen and others in the politest terms and testified their gratitude for all the civilities received capt thornton could not think of going to aix till he had paid his duty to the duke and kissed that hand which had so nobly rewarded his little services he met with a most gracious reception and in a few days left the camp  capt thornton was the second son of sir roger thornton a gentleman of large fortune in ireland and in essex and a member of the house of commons he was about twentyfour years of age spoke french and italian perfectly well and understood drawing and those branches of the mathematics so necessary to every officer who chooses to distinguish himself sir roger allowed him three hundred pounds a year but on this occasion he very liberally supplied him he wrote capt conyers a most obliging letter for his son had informed him of the obligations he lay under the young captain received many letters from his uncle the earl of mountworth in which mr conyers was always honorably mentioned  capt thornton recovered very slowly and capt conyerss arm proved much worse than was at first imagined they stayed a long time at aixlachapelle and spa and were determined to go to england but the peace being just signed they changed their resolution and set out for france  chap xv of all the virtues justice is the best valor without it is a common pest pirates and thieves too often with courage graced show us how ill that virtue may be placed it is our complexion makes us chaste or brave justice from reason and from heaven we have all other virtues dwell but in the blood that in the soul and gives the name of good waller on their arrival at paris they hired very grand apartments in the best hotel in a few days they were prepared to visit the marquis de brissac and the duke dayen who received them with marks of the greatest respect and esteem they were visited in return and soon made acquainted with the families of the first distinction the marquis recommended the ablest surgeon and they went on very successfully under his care  they had been about a month at paris when one day capt conyers took it into his head to dress himself as formerly and dine at the old ordinary the people of the house immediately recollected him and were much rejoiced at his return  it seems paris had greatly missed the english guineas that so plentifully rolled about before the war and now promised themselves that my lord anglais would soon pay the expense of all their fireworks and illuminations  he found none of his former acquaintances at table but after dinner he begged the good woman would accept of a pot of coffee and enquired after them  monsieur maquereau said she had very bad fortune at play and was so reduced that for some time he lived on the women of the town but at last he got religion into his head and went into la trappe  the chevalier fanfaron was very unlucky for about a year ago he died of his wounds  i suppose said conyers the chevalier had an affair of honor and fell by it  all i know said the landlady is the chevalier killed a gentleman one night on pontneuf and was so unfortunate as to be taken and broke alive on the wheel at the greve  so much for the chevalier said the captain but you dont tell me a word of my good friend monsieur pense i hope no accident has happened to him  ah poor gentleman said she indeed he is greatly to be pitied it is now just two years since the archers got into his lodgings took him out of bed seized all his papers and effects and carried them to the bastile god knows if he be dead or alive somebody said he was a spy for the english and so the poor good man was ruined  the captain enquired for no more but finished the coffee thanked the good woman and went in a hurry to his lodgings he was vastly moved at the fate of pense and determined to try his interest to save him if it was not too late  he soon dressed and followed captain thornton to the marquiss where he had dined the company were informed of the morning dishabille and imputed it and his long stay to some affair of gallantry on which he was heartily raillyd he raillyd in his turn and the conversation fell into the usual channel the duke dayen came in soon after and in a little time the whole company went to the opera  captain conyers took care to place himself next to the duke and at last found an opportunity of mentioning the case of pense he concluded with assuring his lordship that he held the office of a spy in the utmost contempt but said he this unhappy man has formerly rendered me more services than i can ever repay therefore i hope your lordship will consider the gratitude i owe and grant a favor to me and not to him  i protest said the duke i never heard of this man but all in my power you may command i shall speak to my father marshal noailles and interest myself to the utmost should i succeed you shall soon hear of it but my silence will convince you of the impossibility  conyers passed four days in great anxiety but the fifth he had a visit from the duke who after some conversation told him his friend was alive  then my lord said the captain so am i this is a great point gained but i hope more remains  yes replied the duke i will not keep you longer in suspense the marshal with some difficulty undertook the cause and i have brought you an order to the governor to deliver mr pense and all his effects into your hands but with this injunction that he quits paris in twentyfour hours and france in a week  the captain took the order and most heartily thanked the duke  i know not said this nobleman how pense escaped for he has been a most notorious offender but his art was great and by little discoveries protracted his time so long that i believe at last they were ashamed to hang him  but i see you are impatient to be the messenger of good news and shall only add that i expect you tomorrow at dinner  he was in the highest delight and immediately drove to the bastile accompanied by capt thornton  the proper compliments being paid to the governor the captain mentioned mr pense but was answered civilly though in a cold unsatisfactory manner  sir said the captain i believe i have a paper in my hand that will convince you i am not here to ask impertinent questions  when the governor had read and carefully examined the order he behaved quite in another manner and directed a servant to call mr pense to him  he spoke much of the poor man but seemed to hint that all things considered he had surprising good fortune  pense was conducted into the chamber but his countenance was so changed that his friend scarcely knew him  he bowed and trembled  a small silence intervened but fixing his eyes intently on captain conyers and at last crediting their evidence he cried out  it is he and flew to his arms he hung on his neck he had not words to testify his amazement he clasped him and was in an agony of joy till tears moderated the excess he sobbd and asked broken questions every moment embracing his friend  the scene was very moving nor could the captain refrain the manly honest tribute of a tear  the governor told mr pense that he was at liberty to go with the gentlemen that his papers were sealed up as was the value of his effects in a box which he might take with him but gave him the orders about quitting the kingdom  mr pense made many compliments but seemed to wish he was out of the walls which half an hour saw done and the captain conducted him to his lodgings  as his time was to be short in paris they abridgd a thousand questions to each other and reserved them for a more favorable opportunity only the captain mentioned the situation he was in as to rank and fortune which gave the old man a most sensible pleasure  they now examined his finances and found he had a remainder of six hundred pounds sterling they debated on the application of the money but found that the mere interest would by no means afford him a decent maintenance  my dear friend said pense let me settle this affair  take the money and allow me what you think proper by way of pension during my life  be it so replied the captain and immediately he drew up a little instrument and gave him a letter to his banker in london to honor his bills for twentyfive pounds for every three months  poor pense once more shed tears and could only add  you are too good and i am too happy  many towns were proposed for his residence for to england he could not safely go and the captain fixed on brussels as a cheap and agreeable place matters being thus adjusted they passed the remainder of the day to their mutual satisfaction and next morning pense bid adieu to his faithful friend and took the coach to lisle but not before the captain had obliged him to accept of forty pieces  perhaps i ought to extol the goodnature of capt conyers  to paint his friendship in the brightest colors and to show the amiableness and selfsatisfaction of a grateful heart  by so doing should i not deprive my reader of the pleasure of doing it himself  when i consult my own ease it is only with a view of indulging his judgment  chap xvi  his curdling blood forgot to glide confusion on his fainting vitals hung and faultring accents fluttered on his tongue garth capt thornton was not yet quite cured for his wounds by some little irregularities had frequently opened capt conyers was perfectly recovered and as his regiment had been for some time in england he began to consider that his duty required his presence whilst he was preparing to attend it he received a letter that gave him pain and pleasure in short the regiment was broke he was now his own master and determined to stay with his friend till he was quite fit to travel  since said he that i am now at full liberty and have an easy fortune ought i not to think on those friends to whom i owe my very being perhaps that dear good man mr kindly or some of his family may want my assistance  perhaps i may be useful to the worthy lord truegood or his charming sons heavens what a joy must i not feel at contributing to their satisfaction what pleasure will they not receive at seeing their little jack completely happy  ought i not to think on my mother ought i not to seek her out and relieve her distresses and have i not neglected these duties too long  such thoughts made him glow with alternate shame and pleasure and determined him to visit ireland as soon as possible  the captains passed their time in paris in the most agreeable manner and were much respected by the ladies i find a few hints that persuade me they were not without amusements of a delicate nature but as the papers are silent as to the particulars so must i  it happened that capt magragh of lord clares regiment had lately taken apartments in the same hotel this gentleman thought it his duty to pay his respects to the two english officers and made them a very civil visit they received him in a polite manner and in an hours conversation found out his rank and his character he was of a lively soldierlike disposition and very communicative his father had quitted ireland and followed the fortune of king james the second he was born in france but spoke english with a prodigious irish accent though he had never been in that kingdom he told them of the vast estate his father lost in ireland and how near he was the other day of recovering it he spoke of the war in germany and in flanders and gave them a history of his own exploits he mentioned the valor of the irish and without considering the french policy seemed to glory in their being sent foremost on the most desperate attacks his conversation and the oddity of his language was agreeable enough and made our friends desire a further acquaintance  in a few days he invited them to a genteel supper with two other officers of the irish brigade the chat turned on war and capt magragh spoke very eloquently on sieges and battles for he could really speak on little else  one of the officers in a laughing way mentioned something of an unfortunate expedition into spain which obliged the captain to enlarge upon it gentlemen said he i must tell you my fatal story you must know that my fathers brother that is my uncle by the fathers side was a merchant at cadiz he was as rich as a thousand jews and always promised to make me his son and heir but  the devil fire all priests about seventeen or eighteen years ago a son of a whore one father kelly came over from ireland and brought his sister with him she was the widow of one squire connor and young and handsome enough what will you have of it but my foolish uncle got acquainted with this father kelly and his sister and by my own soul he married her to be sure i wrote to my uncle and towld him what a fool he was and what a rogue he was to cheat a gentleman like me and his own flesh and blood the old fellow was very saucy and by my own soul i had a great mind to go to spain and beat his coat well gentlemen about two years agon i got a letter from a friend at cadiz that my uncle was growing sickly so i took post thinking to make it up with him but by my soul i was late for the old teef hid himself under ground now will you believe it the devil take me and i swear by him that made me if the old rogue left me a gray groat i spoke to madam my aunt and towld her of my journey and my great expenses and of the wrong she did me and the like and only begged her to let us fairly divide the money betwixt us the lady began to laugh but said she had some commiseration on me and made some fine speeches but the devil a farthing would she give but four hundred pistoles i took the money and giving her a hearty curse wished her and her thirty thousand pound at hell  you had hard fortune indeed said capt thornton but perhaps she may make you amends some time or other sir replied magragh i shall never trouble her no more i am now a captain in the first best regiment in europe i have the cross of st lewis which the king gave me because i wouldnt be killed at philipsbourg and i have a royal donation of three hundred livres a year so my dear what do i want i love my friends and my good friends love me and i vow to god i am as happy as the king himself god bless him i love my countrymen the irish and i love the english well enough but faith and soul they are too hard upon us  captain thornton observed a peculiar gravity in the countenance of his friend and thought by changing the current of conversation to remove it he tried many ways but conyers seemed lost in thought his silence gave a serious turn to the company and they broke up much sooner than was intended  next morning captain thornton had a very early visit from mr conyers for he had not slept  my dear thornton said he you must wonder at my behavior but i insist on your friendship and beg you will not require an explanation of the only thing i cannot divulge  thornton imagined a quarrel and rose in a hurry to stop his going out of the room his friend could not forbear laughing at his serious figure but assuring him on his honor that a quarrel was the least in his thoughts the other was pacified and returned to his bed  i am said conyers in the oddest situation perhaps ever man was in i am far from unhappy but some doubts and anxieties so much torment me that i cannot be at peace till they are satisfied dear conyers said the other i hope you will indulge me with my share of what gives you uneasiness i think i have a just claim to it  i believe replied conyers your friendship is sincere but my case is of such a nature that as you cannot assist me i must only desire your patience  he revolved a thousand projects to bring about his affair in the properest manner he remembered father kelly and called back every circumstance of his childhood so clearly that he had not the least doubt but mrs magragh was his mother  he reflected on her features and brought her face familiar to his imagination he owned she had not been the tenderest of parents but nature spoke and threw her faults into the most favorable light he ardently wished to embrace her and as his filial affection arose the tender tear fell down his cheeks the good the humane heart will not call this an unmanly weakness  the sensations of his soul were natural and the result of an honest mind at last he determined on a journey to cadiz and went immediately to mr waters his banker for proper letters  whilst he was speaking to this gentleman on the necessary credit he might want he took an opportunity of asking him if he knew mr magragh who had been a merchant at cadiz yes sir replied mr waters extremely well for he was my correspondent many years i hear said the captain he has left a widow and should be glad to know if she be alive she was so very lately answered the banker for i have had letters from her about some effects remaining in my hands i assure you she is a very notable woman and vastly rich as for her riches said conyers i have nothing to say but you would much oblige me by recommending me to her notice and good offices in a friendly manner and likewise for another letter wherein you will please to mention me as her near relation this last i shall only make use of in case i find her really so mr waters very readily complied and promised to be very secret in the affair  captain conyers was now much easier in his mind and the alteration in his conduct gave a very sensible pleasure to his friend but it was of short duration for he informed him that he was obliged to set out immediately for madrid where his stay should be as short as possible captain thornton was obliged to acquiesce and preparations were made for his journey the marquis de brissac was surpised at the project of mr conyers but got him recommendatory letters to the french minister and advised his traveling with the kings messenger especially as he seemed in haste  a messenger was dispatched the week following who had orders to take particular care of the captain  he took a servant with him and with some reluctance bid adieu to his friends  chap xvii now by my soul and by these hoary hairs i am so overwhelmed with pleasure that i feel a later spring within my withered limbs that shoots me out again drydens don seb an account of a journey post must be very unsatisfactory to a reader and tire and fatigue him as much as the traveller i shall therefore avoid the dry insipid relation and beg of him to suppose that no accident happened on the road and that our captain got safe to madrid in the usual time i shall omit the civilities showed by the french minister who advised him in the best manner for his further journey to cadiz he was impatient to be there and so am i  on his arrival he waited on mr fitzgerald the merchant on whom he had a credit this gentleman received him in the most courteous manner and insisted on his accepting an apartment in his house in a day or two captain conyers made an enquiry about mrs magragh and mentioned a letter he had for her the merchant told him she was an intimate friend and offering to accompany him they immediately paid her a visit  judge gentle reader the emotions of his soul when mr fitzgerald presented him to his mother for such she really was  though he was determined in his conduct and had put on every resolution yet he trembled and grew pale when he saluted her but recovering himself he attributed his tremor to the fatigue of his journey which was easily credited mrs magragh read the letter and with great politeness assured him of her respects and readiness to serve him they dined that day at mr fitzgeralds and the captain endeavored to make himself as agreeable as possible and few men could be more so he observed that every body paid mrs magragh a particular respect that she was vastly improved and spoke with great strength of reason and sense though in her former tone of voice time had added a few wrinkles to her brow but had taken away very little of the beauty of her complexion  he frequently caught himself too earnestly looking at her and very often met her eyes  next day the company dined at her house mirth and good humor abounded and each strove who should add most mrs magragh showed a more than common civility to the captain and often repeated that he had much of the air of a gentleman who had been a very dear friend to her and her family in a word she became familiar which still made her more agreeable  mr fitzgerald asked when they got home what he had done to the widow for said he she told me in spanish that you had such a face and such a voice she could scarce keep her eyes off of you faith captain continued he twould be very unkind to snap up one of our greatest fortunes at so short a warning when she has held out half a dozen regular sieges  mrs fitzgerald a little raillied him but i assure you said she without a jest i never saw mrs magragh so free and so pleased with a gentleman in all my life  the captain laughed in his turn and each had somewhat to say  he thought matters were pretty ripe for an explanation and as mrs magragh had given him a general invitation he determined on a visit and if possible to open the scene next morning he went to breakfast with her and was very kindly received when the ordinary chat was over and her maid had retired he began to put his scheme in practice but not without many hesitations  madam said he i never thought to be so much beholden to my friend mr waters as i find i am by being introduced to a lady of your merit who has certainly afforded me more joy than ever i expected to receive  this other letter madam will a little help me in what i am to say  she took the letter and very attentively read it and her eyes seemed to examine him as carefully  this letter sir said she informs me that you are my relation i cannot say the contrary but i protest i am at a loss how it can be i own i have a very particular regard for you on account of my friends hearty recommendation  i confess my esteem for your person and behavior and as you appear a gentleman i should be sorry to change my conduct by your going on any erroneous project  give me leave madam replied the captain to assure you on my honor i have no views other than paying the greatest respect and duty where i so naturally owe them  i should think myself said she extremely happy to have a relation of your character and figure though i cannot imagine such a thing possible yet i own there is something that makes me wish it therefore i beg sir you will inform me and doubt not but it will be to our mutual satisfaction  is it possible madam said he that twenty years can have worn out all remembrance of my face  can you forget our wretched situation on the common in ireland  can my poor blind father  stop sir cried she for heavens sake  i know not what to think good god  pray have patience and let me recover my breath  her agony was extreme and he was obliged to support her to the window for air  gracious heaven said she at last i dare not hope for such a blessing but let me beseech you sir to pull down your right stocking  he instantly obeyed and when she discovered a large mole on his leg which he had never observed yes cried she it is my dearest my illusd son  oh jack  and clasping him in her arms in transport was for some moments deprived of every sense he embraced her with the sincerest affection and for a long while neither could utter a syllable  once more i must indulge the imagination of the kind reader and permit him to supply from his own natural stock what mine is defective in  let him call forth every tender idea let him think on the affection of a parent on the love of a child and if he can let him conceive the mighty joy at recovering our long lost darling hopes let him do this and it is possible he may have some faint idea of what this poor woman felt but to paint convulsive motions to mark the alternate complexion and to set down every dropping passionate word is not in the power of mr le sage crebillon fielding or even a ch  t  f  d  when the goodnatured reader has finished his private reflections i beg he will go one step farther and bring back the mother and son to their wonted sense and understanding  my dearest jack said she i have treated you barbarously  indeed i have  but i shall try to atone for all my sins god has been bountiful to you and most merciful to me  i have not merited his goodness but shall endeavor to deserve his favor  i hope i shall  but my dear jack give me some account of yourself tell me of all your accidents how you arrived to the honorable station i see you in and why your name is conyers  tell me all my dear child and i shall most faithfully recount though i blush for it every part of my life since we parted  oh my son could you have known the trouble my usage to you has given me you would pity an unhappy woman  but tell me my dear jack can you forgive me  i fear it is impossible  my conduct said he shall convince my dearest mother that i have forgot all things but my duty and my love  then said she i am happy and my love shall reward you  but no more now  you must change your quarters and live with me  does mr waters know you are my son  no madam said the captain he knows no more than what i desired him to mention in his letter  thats well said she neither is it necessary he should i must not own you for my son as it would contradict what i have always reported but you must be my nephew the son of my sister which will sufficiently warrant my affection for you  this matter being settled they went together to mr fitzgeralds the family were greatly surprised and pleased when mrs magragh presented her nephew she told them the method he took to discover himself and all compliments were made suitable to the occasion that night he returned to her house and the whole town visited and congratulated them  chap xviii an unseen hand makes all our moves and some are great and some are small some climb to good some from good fortune fall some wise men and some fools we call figures alas of speech for destiny plays us all cowley no doubt mrs magragh was impatient to hear the story of her son and begged he would begin and not omit the minutest circumstances he obeyed and carried her through every scene of his life except a few parts not so fit for her to hear and concluded by his being a captain of dragoons the accident that brought him to the knowledge of her being alive and how soon he determined to pay his duty  he did not mention his being on halfpay lest she should have insisted on his staying at cadiz which he by no means intended to do  he recited all his adventures in a full and clear manner and so pathetically worded his sufferings that she wept most bitterly but his good fortune succeeding a visible joy spread over her countenance  she embraced him a thousand times and blessed god for restoring to her a son and a son of such prudence and so many virtues  now said she my dear jack it is but just to recount my own history and inform you of some things that you are a stranger to  she then began from her being a servant at sir roger thorntons  in this family said she i lived very happily i was young and tolerably handsome and it pleased sir roger to think me more so than perhaps i really was he made me presents seemed very fond of me was a mighty fine comely gentleman and in short overcome my foolish weakness i proved with child and he married me to jerry connor you came into the world with that name but my dear jack your real father was sir roger thornton  more wonders cried her son  is it possible  she seemed surprised at his exclamations but he informed her of his intimacy with captain thornton and of the accident that brought on their great friendship she was vastly delighted with this incident and charmed to find sir roger was still alive  this obliged her to begin a little more particularly and she continued her account to the death of jerry connor and the parting with her son  as i have placed all these facts in the first pages of this history where i imagined they naturally came in i must refer my reader to them and take up her story where i dropped it  thus said she father kelly and i cohabited in a scandalous manner and the proofs against us were so strong and so many that he could not live in the country his uncle the bishop gave him a good sum of money and a letter to a prior of a rich convent in this city he persuaded me to go with him and i had no business to stay behind but he would by no means consent to my taking you i was in the utmost trouble and could not think of parting with my child for ever at last he proposed sending you to his brothers in the county of galway who would take care of your education and at a certain age send you to cadiz  the barbarous wretch laid the scheme and exposed you to perish on the road he was so cruel that he never would give me the least satisfaction or let me know what he had done with you i was too much depending on him to quarrel and had no other consolation but my frequent tears  we embarked at cork in a ship loaded with beef tallow and worsted stuffs and arrived safe at this place it was agreed i should pass for his sister and the widow of one mr connor of clonmell he went to the convent and delivered his letter to father purcell the prior where i believe he was well received for he returned vastly pleased he was soon in the habit of his order and provided me a lodging in a good family and made me dress in a very decent manner  i know not how he managed with the prior but he gave me to understand that i must call him my uncle and be extremely civil when he visited me and next day i had that honor father purcell or rather my uncle was a comely grave man of about sixty vastly polite and courteous and seemingly of a most religious deportment however my pious brother soon hinted that i was to be more than merely civil to him if i expected to be maintained  what could i do  i was compelled to forfeit my honor that i might save my reputation in short i complied and my brother and uncle constantly visited me and were mighty tender and affectionate relations  you see my dearest jack i hide not from you even my own shame  how are the best institutions perverted but let us not condemn the whole for the wickedness of a few  thus i lived for about four or five months and was visited by the best families and paid them in return i own i was not a fit companion for people of fortune but as i could not converse in their manner i behaved with great modesty and silence this procured me a general good character and made me pass for what i did not merit  i had a mind to try the temper of father purcell and one day very gravely hinted an apprehension of my being with child the old man stared and was in a strange dilemma for he had no notion but father kelly was my real brother  he walked about the room in a very pensive manner but at last  well said he if my dear widow be with child i must find a father for it  shall i get you a husband  i have no objection said i provided he be a good one  leave it to me replied the prior but it must be done in a hurry and shall instantly set about it so put on your best airs for a visit tomorrow evening  i took his advice but could not forbear laughing at the oddity of my scheme and wondered where it would end  father purcell kept his word and introduced mr magragh he seemed a plain good sort of a man of about fiftyfive he was very ceremonious and complaisant but spoke little in half an hour the prior opened a more interesting conversation  my dear niece said he my good friend mr magragh has often seen you and has communicated his sentiments to me no doubt you are of age to choose for yourself but as i know his integrity and worth i think it my duty as a parent to advise you to receive his honorable addresses as you ought  it will be much better than returning to ireland  i blushed and only replied that i should always be guided by him  madam said mr magragh i am a man in trade of a good character and an easy fortune his reverence has told you my heart which if you will be pleased to accept you shall command every thing in my power sir said i i doubt not your merit and as my uncle is your friend i am sure he means an happiness to us both and shall submit myself to his determination  this said the prior is making love like people of sense and not like giddy children come my dear niece since you leave it to me give me your hand  here my good friend i bestow you that inestimable treasure a good wife  take her and i pray god to bless you both  mr magragh embraced me very tenderly and i behaved as i ought  well madam said the poor man when shall i be happy  when shall i call you my own  lord sir said i you are so pressing  i believe a month or two will be time enough  a month cried the prior nay now you spoil all i hoped you would have mentioned tomorrow  and i said mr magragh was thinking on the present minute for my maxim is never to put off till tomorrow what i can do today  it is a most excellent rule replied the prior and let us put it in practice what say you my dear neice  shall i perform the holy office  i blushed but made no answer  silence said he is a consent therefore let us go to mr magraghs send for a few friends and finish the business  his reverence said my lover has been always my friend  with some entreaties i suffered myself to be conducted to his house where in the presence of my brother and two more my good uncle performed his priestly duty and made me mistress of this habitation  mr magragh was really a goodnatured inoffensive man and very affectionately loved me i kept very good company i read a good deal and wrote and assisted him very much in his business by degrees i grew very expert and began to think and talk in a quite different manner  my poor husband was extremely delighted with my diligence and capacity and only wanted a child to complete his happiness but none came notwithstanding the frequent and fervent prayers of the holy prior and my pious brother  thus i lived for about five years with great seeming happiness but your image and father kellys person were too often present to make me really so i dreaded his more than brotherly love for he sometimes visited at very improper seasons i knew his temper and as he began to be suspected on many accounts particularly for some intrigues with spanish ladies i was in continual apprehensions of some fatal accident nay i much feared the jealousy of the prior for he gave me some hints at last i missed the visits of my brother and inquired after him from my uncle he shook his head but no satisfactory answer came i cried for my brother but i never saw him since  he was either murdered or carried to the inquisition and i violently suspected the prior  i was really sorry for his misfortune but not displeased at the loss of his company i was much more satisfied when in three months after my holy uncle father purcell departed this life and left me to enjoy it with peace and real happiness  these impediments to the tranquillity of my mind being removed i applied myself more closely to the study of every thing that might give my husband pleasure i still improved and arrived to such perfection that he confided all to my care and management and i aver to you my dearest jack that i never deceived him in any shape after the death of the prior  his fortune increased very largely and we lived with great harmony and content the last two years his infirmities made him extremely peevish but i bore all with patience and assisted and attended him with the tenderness and duty of a good wife the poor man was sensible of my regard and when he died i found his will had made me absolute mistress of his whole fortune  i have resisted many solicitations from people who called themselves lovers i knew the world too well to imagine a woman of my years had all the charms they pretended to find in me i fancy i guessed right that my thirty thousand pounds was my principal beauty  now my dear jack forget the injury i did you and forget my faults which i have most sincerely repented of and you shall be my husband nor will i ever have another  though we are unhappily of different religions yet believe me i am not so bigoted to mine as to desire a change in yours i have learnt by experience that the true end and use of religion is to make us good virtuous and charitable  since your religion has taught you the practice of those great duties why should i wish you to alter no my dear jack keep strictly to and be faithful in it  my religion did not make me wicked it was my weakness and my ignorance thank god i am now wiser i find my dear child that your duty will soon call you from me but to convince you of the sincerity of my love half my fortune is this moment yours when all my affairs are settled i will follow you to england and you shall command the remainder allowing me four hundred pounds a year during my life which will be more than i shall have occasion for i hope my dearest jack is now convinced that i make every satisfaction in my power and that i at last prove myself a tender and affectionate mother  the captain most ardently embraced her and returned every acknowledgement that so much goodness deserved she set about her promise immediately and in a short time gave him bills on london for fifteen thousand pounds  whilst these matters were transacting he received a letter from his friend thornton declaring his unhappiness without him and pressing his return he likewise received letters from colonel manly and doctor grace these gave him great concern for they informed him of the death of his old master good mr sampson he had requested his wife to settle the fortune on captain conyers at her death and she had most generously executed the proper deeds reserving two thousand pounds to dispose of as she thought proper  he acquainted his mother with these matters and how necessary his presence was to take care of his estate and his military post she confessed the reasonableness of his desires and promising to part with him with as little regret as possible he prepared to set out the first opportunity by sea to marseilles  she gave him many useful instructions and advised him to secrecy with regard to his family and the obsurity of his birth  though said she you are in fact more praiseworthy by having made your fortune with a fair character than had it descended from your father yet the world is made of such envious stuff they take pleasure in lessening the virtues of others yet it is certain he rises the higher with the sensible part of the world the lower he sprung from  your fortune my dear son continued she will be now very considerable but let me beg of you to believe that no fortune can stand long against bad management be an oeconomist and put your affairs in so regular a channel that in an instant you may know your income and your expenses without regularity all will be in confusion let your accounts and your watch be wound up punctually to a time or both will go wrong  avoid a number of idle and superfluous servants that eat out an estate keep from expensive schemes and projects and trouble or rather please the lawyers as little as possible  determine to be happy for you know the means  one word more and i have done  i guess at your constitution by your complexion therefore i advise you to marry but submit the manner to your own prudence  he was often astonished how she came to reason speak and write so correctly and could not avoid asking her the question  it is not said she so difficult a matter as you imagine though we must have some assistance from nature  i very severely felt the want of these accomplishments and resolved if possible to acquire them  i told you i read much i got good authors and applied closely to them they gave me sentiments i was a stranger to i improved considerably by the help of company but my own project vastly shortened my labor i set myself a task every day and carefully wrote out two or three pages of the spectator guardian and other sensible works so that in a short time i became mistress of their style and manner had always something to say in conversation and spelt well without the assisstance of a grammar besides the accounts i kept and the numbers of letters i wrote made these matters familiar to me  this may serve to show you that a little pains and industry in the beginning prevents a vast deal of trouble and labor in the end  if captain conyers was pleased at finding his mother he was prodigiously more so at discovering in her all the marks of good sense and prudence  he remitted his money to his correspondent in london but at the same time acquainted colonel manly of it and added a codicil to his will he wrote to all his friends and promised to join them as soon as possible  a good ship being now ready to sail he paid his respects to all his acquaintances at cadiz and made some genteel presents particularly to the family of mr fitzgerald  all were concerned at losing so polite a companion and he was loaded with praises and caresses his mother could not bear it with that resignation she at first thought but however she raised her spirits and with many blessings saw him set sail  the voyage was prosperous and he arrived at marseilles safe and in good health he took post for paris and once more embraced his dear friend capt thornton after an absence of eight months  chap xix thou brother of my choice a band more sacred than natures brittle tie by holy friendship glory and fame stood still for thy arrival my soul seemed wanting of its better half and languishd for thy absence like a prophet that waits the inspiration of his god rowes tamerlane he found paris extremely crowded with english and began to think that the scheme of doctor grace for a duty on the exportation of our nobility and gentry would yield a much larger revenue than could be well imagined  capt thornton was quite recovered and had waited a month extraordinary  i assure you said he i almost despaired of you and was just preparing to set out with my cousin lord truegood  lord truegood cried captain conyers in a hurry  yes replied the other lord truegood my uncle the earl of mountworths son  do you know him  no answered conyers but the similitude of a name i have a great respect for certainly gave me a flutter  now i think of it said thornton you could not know him at least by this title for his father was created an earl but since the rebellion  i promise you my cousin is well worth your acquaintance  just then lord truegood entered  my lord said thornton give me leave to present to you my dearest and most worthy friend captain conyers and i insist on your loving him as well as i do  it always affords me said my lord the highest satisfaction to be known to gentlemen of your distinguished worth and merit and wish i may deserve the honor of your friendship  if it be an honor said conyers what must mine be should your lordship grant me your favorable opinion and countenance  a truce with your compliments cried thornton let us be a triumvirate and make the world stare at our friendship  by degrees they dropped into the familiar style and each seemed happy in the other two  conyers very attentively examined the features of my lord and called to his remembrance his much beloved master harry  his heart felt an unusual pleasure joy sparkled in his eyes and added such charms to his conversation that his friend protested he believed the gravity of the spaniards had only served to give him more spirits  perhaps said my lord they were so confined when there that now they rush out with greater force but be it as it will i am vastly pleased to find wit and good sense so agreeably blended  conyers made the proper reply but retired pretty soon for he wanted repose  next day they visited their friends and a week was very cheerfully employed in this time mr conyers received a letter from his correspondent in london that he had credited him with the money remitted from cadiz that he had paid three bills drawn on him by mr pense of brussels amounting to seventyfive pounds and that his correspondent of that city had advised him of the death of the said mr pense  captain conyers was much concerned for the poor man but his superior joy soon got the better he did not think on his death as so much gained but determined to employ penses money to other purposes than his own  lord truegood had all the softness and delicacy of behavior that tenderness to mankind that ease and at the same time that dignity in his deportment that distinguishes or ought to distinguish the nobleman he was generous without profuseness mild without childishness and courteous to all but supported his station he had seen the different states with critical eyes and observed the faults and perfections with a view to the good of his country and his own honor this gentleman conceived a most particular esteem for captain conyers and every day improved it  to be applauded and regarded by men of sense and knowledge is the highest honor a man can receive the captain had this from lord truegood and was sensible of it  a little more time was spent in paris in compliments on taking leave particularly of the marquis de brissac and the duke dayen  those paid to ladies i am as ignorant of as the reader  every thing being prepared the three friends took post for calais the packet soon landed them at dover and each had a peculiar satisfaction at arriving at london  chap xx the grateful mind a pleasure feels beyond what vice and passion yields the grateful heart a bliss bestows beyond what vulgarcunning knows this noble virtue in the breast of every virtue we are possessed anonimous it is not to be expressed the hearty and affectionate manner sir roger thornton and lord mountworth received captain conyers neither is it possible to describe the joys he felt when he embraced the author of his life and the founder of his happiness each insisted on his living with them and contended strongly about it but captain conyers ended the kind dispute by assuring them he had many reasons for being in private lodgings but hoped they would indulge him the honor of visiting with freedom  he was presented to each family who could not enough admire the many excellent qualifications they soon found he possessed his generous valor was the subject of each day particularly with the ladies  it is just they should peculiarly admire the brave when they only are capable of rewarding them  lady mountworth still preserved a large residue of beauty the accustomed sweetness of her temper and her good sense remained but all her charms seemed transplanted and to blow afresh in her daughter lady harriot she was now about twentyfour years of age her beauty was exquisite and none could be insensible of it but the rectitude of her manners the integrity of her soul and the affability of her behavior could not fail of numbers of admirers perhaps she was too delicate in the choice of a husband and required more perfections in a man than a large fortune and high titles she was so whimsical and singular in her notions that she thought a rational tender and faithful companion was infinitely more essential to a scheme of happiness than a multitude of servants and the most brilliant retinue  my lord and lady often raillied this temper but as they knew her understanding and judgment they always left her free  captain conyers admired her virtues he was charmed at the easy elegance of her conversation he gazed on her beauties and his heart insensibly stole from him and became her property  certain it is lady harriot began to have sentiments much in his favor and some delicate expressions and the conduct of the eyes soon discovered what passed in their souls  though lady harriot possessed his imagination yet his private affairs were attended to lord mountworth was an excellent adviser in money affairs as well as other matters he therefore begged his lordships assistance in the management of twenty thousand pounds which brought on a conversation that discovered the circumstances of the captain  his money was soon disposed of in the funds and he prepared to set out for his estate whilst this was doing he remembered his promise to himself and sent five hundred pounds of mr penses to the correspondent society in london for promoting english protestant schools in ireland but his name was not mentioned  he likewise remembered his old friend mr sangfroid the surgeon and after much enquiry found him in very obscure lodgings the captain was dressed in his regimentals and sangfroid received him with very great respect  sir said he i am sorry for your accident a slight touch i presume but my care and diligence will soon make matters easy to you and you may depend on being quite safe in my hands  he was going on in the usual style but the captain with an hearty laugh cried out bless me mr sangfroid  have you really forgot me  sangfroid looked up and staring at him for some time cried  forget you   eh  oons i believe it is honest conyers  oh god  come to my arms my dear friend said the captain and use me as such  they embraced and the surgeon was quite confounded at his appearance and testified his surprise  we shall said conyers have time enough to talk of that but at present let us think on your affairs for you do not seem so happy as i could wish you have been my kind benefactor now try my gratitude and honestly tell me your wants for i fear you have some  poor sangfroid began a most melancholy story he told the variety of misfortunes he had met with  he placed them all to the account of his folly and extravagance and concluded by his being in a poor wretched condition  his story was extremely moving but it convinced the captain of the misery that man draws on himself who chooses to be directed by passions and appetites rather than prudence and economy  however he was determined to serve him and put forty guineas into his hands  now said he this is only for the present when you find a surgeoncy to be bought command my purse most freely  heavens said sangfroid how ill they argue that call this a bad world  you are in it  ten such men atone for the faults of millions  my dear friend continued he with tears in his eyes i believe some relations would advance two hundred pounds if i had the remainder i could this moment purchase a surgeoncy to a regiment of guards  but it is impossible to expect so much goodness  expect said conyers every thing from me go about it my friend immediately and in three days i shall call and finish the affair  the captain performed his promise and with the assistance of l  00 mr sangfroid was made completely happy  his next enquiry was for doctor st amor but he had been lately made a bishop in ireland he visited his good widow landlady in surry whom he made vastly happy by a present of fifty guineas and an annuity of ten pounds a year  he found out that his old master monsieur champignon had been sometime dead and that miss tonton having the guardianship of her own person had wisely disposed of it to a lifeguard man  sir peter shallow was still alive and of the same weak importance  sir john curious was at rest but his lady was very busy with a second husband whom she married in her weeds  poor mrs cannon had failed in some of her annuities and was obliged to retire to yorkshire for cheapness  the bishop had long since been translated and his works followed him  as to many others whom he knew he judged it not proper to renew his acquaintance or even inquire after in a word he discharged all those duties that good men recommend and what few practice  captain thornton had been so long absent from his regiment that he was obliged to take leave of his friends and join his post in scotland and his father sir roger had been some time in berkshire on business this increased the intimacy of captain conyers with lord mountworths family particularly with lord truegood  he found out by degrees the situation of affairs and that the young lords brother master william had taken a fancy to the sea service and had distinguished himself on many late occasions as a captain of a man of war and was then at his station  whatever good opinion the family conceived of capt conyers an affair happened that did not lessen it it seems mr sangfroid had been at the captains lodgings and was informed of his being at lord mountworths he followed and though the captain was not there yet the servant conducted him into the chamber where sat my lord and lady with lady harriot my lord with his usual politeness ordered a chair and told him he expected the captain every moment a little chat arose which at last fell on his friend  sangfroid was silent as to former times but mentioned his having been in good circumstances and had rendered some services to mr conyers he then painted out the last action of his friend and his real worth and honor in such lively colors that drew from my lord and lady the highest encomiums on the captain lady harriot was silent but pleasure blushed in her face  sangfroid waited for some time but at last took his leave  lady harriot now opened on the charms of gratitude and true generosity  these said she are the masterly touches of a finished piece and no character can be complete without them  they argue every humane sentiment and are an abstract of all virtues  your servant lady harriot said my lord and bowed  i protest you would make an excellent painter but tell me my dearest harriot which would you choose to trace the person or the mind of the captain  she blushed but answered  you know my lord i always speak truth and can ill disguise my heart  i hope i shall not be thought criminal when i assure your lordship i would choose both his person and his mind  and if i can said my lord you shall have your choice  he then most tenderly embraced her and lady mountworth almost wept with joy  the captain was much pressed to return to the country particularly by colonel manly who mentioned something of the borough it happened that the colonel and lord mountworth were intimate friends so was easily persuaded to let his son lord truegood accompany the captain but not before he had acquainted him with the sentiments of his sister and his own inclinations to such a match the poor captain scarcely knew how to bid adieu to his dear lady harriot but as he had given some hints to lord truegood his lordship eased him in so delicate an affair  lady harriot said he i must beg your hand to help me to raise my friends for he is yours and you his  she saluted the captain and each attempted to answer the other  these are broken words said my lord but we shall piece them together on our return  one kiss more  now adieu  they went to my lord and lady who as soon as acquainted with this affair embraced mr conyers and looked on him as a son  your lordship said the captain is no stranger to my fortune but this paper contains an abstract of it and i most cheerfully submit myself to your lordships determination  a few compliments ensued and lord truegood with capt conyers stepped into their post chaise and soon arrived to the end of their journey  chap xxi our grandsire adam ere of eve possessed alone and even in paradise unblessed with mournful looks the blissful scenes surveyed and wandered in the solitary shade the maker saw took pity and bestowed woman the last the best reserve of god popes jan and may never was man received with more affection particularly by his sister the colonel and doctor grace  it was a jubilee in the village  the remembrance of past and the enjoyment of present happiness occasioned many tears  he paid every duty to mrs sampson and she regarded him as her brother and her son he recited every circumstance since they parted and did not forget his aunt magragh at cadiz and proposed her living with her when she arrived in england  mrs sampson was extremely pleased in his good fortune but as she imagined the colonel wished an alliance with him she hinted that perhaps there was more in store  indeed said she i think you ought to marry nor do i know a woman in the world i would sooner recommend to you than miss manly  she is grown a delightful creature and is so good i am sure she would make an excellent wife you know the colonel has fifteen hundred pounds a year and a great deal of ready money if you will set about it iil engage it shall be done  my dear sister replied conyers i know not how to thank you as i ought but this affair is impossible  i am no stranger to miss manlys beauty and merit but we are not always masters of our inclinations  he then told her the history of his heart and spoke so tenderly on the charms of lady harriot that she entirely agreed with him  colonel manly was still hearty and tolerably well he was vastly pleased at the figure and behavior of lord truegood he spoke with great pleasure of his grandfather and the present earl and received him with the utmost affection and regard they frequently dined with the colonel and miss did the honors of the table in so polite and wellbred a manner that charmed all but particularly lord truegood he was struck with her beauty but the elegance of her conversation firmly fixed every tender thought  conyers perceived his lordships anxiety and guessing the cause hinted his suspicion  true said my lord i own my love nor am i ashamed of it an object so infinitely worthy must engross my heart dear conyers let me require your friendship assist me with the colonel and his dearest daughter as i assisted you with harriot i am certain of my fathers consent and i shall be the happiest of men  the captain who was rejoiced at this incident assured him of his interest and the next day not only obtained the colonels consent but artfully found out from miss that my lord was far from being disagreeable to her  lord truegood was in raptures and the friendship of conyers curtailed a long courtship which of all people men of sense and sincerity are the least capable of doing for themselves the way being now paved the affair went smoothly on and only wanted lord and lady mountworths approbation  the captain resigned to the colonel the promise of his interest for a seat in parliament and begged him to transfer it where soon it would be naturally due when his family affairs were settled they all agreed on a journey to london and as the colonel and mrs sampson were infirm they were obliged to make easy stages his lordship daily made fresh discoveries of the understanding and good nature of miss manly and she found her pleasure and satisfaction arise the more she conversed with him  in short it is not in nature to give more real joy than what this good company felt  on their arrival in london captain conyers flew to lady harriot and lord truegood to his father one discovered his soul more openly and the other mentioned what lord mountworth and my lady were charmed to hear  matters were in this situation when honor attacked the captain with such force as almost to unhinge his flattering hopes this busy companion seemed to hint that he ought in justice to make himself known to my lord before the marriage that it would heighten his character and prevent the imputation of an impostor  he owned the truth of this but at the same time he looked on his person accomplishments and fortune as very far from counterfeits his discovering himself gave him no uneasiness but he dreaded that his love might be injured by it and as he could by no means think of putting it to the hazard he determined still to be silent  i write the fact and will neither approve or condemn this conduct the truth is he loved and those who have felt that passion perhaps will make allowances for the faults it occasions  why should i take up the time of my kind reader  he will naturally suppose that visits were paid and returned  that a settlement was agreed on  that the lawyers were feed and all necessaries done to the finishing a matter of such consequence but without my help he will not know that lady harriots fortune was but ten thousand pounds  two people if not four imagined the lawyers were very slow in their motions and the clerks very dilatory in their busisiness a few guineas enlivened their pens and the happy day at last came the bishop of  joined all their hands and established the love and affection of their souls  lord mountwworth would not too soon disturb the pleasure of his sons and daughters but in six weeks he began to think of returning to ireland from whence he had been absent three years as he found captain conyers and lady harriot greatly inclined to go he advised him to keep his money matters in such a readiness that he might dispose of it the first convenient opportunity  whatever said my lord some may imagine let me advise you to purchase in that kingdom but in one of those counties the least improved a man of your turn of mind will soon discover the many advantages you will build convenient houses for the poor people and set them a spinning you will almost compel them to industry and labor they will thrive under you and your fortune increase in proportion  his lordship then gave him an account of his own management as was formerly related and assured him the people were all content though his annual income was augmented almost one thousand pounds   if continued he a man takes a pleasure in viewing the trees he planted in seeing them blossom and in tasting their fruit what joy what a rational joy must he receive who beholds a colony of human creatures established by his care flourishing by his bounty and blessing his soul who blessed them  believe me my dear son no earthly happiness can equal this  the captain was too sensible of these truths not to agree with my lord  his spirit was already in ireland and his imagination planed out his future conduct  colonel manly grew impatient to return home there as he said to rest for ever lady truegood could not think of quitting her father and the young lord could not part from his dearest wife so that the old gentleman was perfectly happy when they agreed to accompany him  he took a most tender leave of all his friends but embracing conyers with tears of the truest affection called him his friend his soldier  but could utter no more than heaven bless and protect you and retired with eyes full of the tender passion to which lady mountworth and lady harriot most liberally subscribed  the captain took a good house and garden at richmond for mrs sampson who promised to be most careful of mrs magragh when she arrived he wrote to his mother of all his transactions and gave her full instructions every thing being adjusted this cheerful and happy family quitted london and set out for ireland  chap xxii the wise new prudence from the wise acquire and one brave hero sans anothers fire popes homer the journey was made less tedious by their sprightly and agreeable conversation  his lordship often spoke of ireland but in such a manner as to remove the prejudices he supposed mr conyers might have to it  the face of the country said he is certainly charming and the soil the rivers and the climate abundantly supply every necessary for life it was formerly so woody that the exhalations of the earth were confined and the air wanted a currency consequently it was very fatal to strangers now indeed you will find the other extreme and a shameful neglect of trees but as they have promised so do they mend every day  you will be surprised at their herds of cattle the city of cork alone slaughters for the west indies above eighty thousand every year no doubt it is a profitable branch but so much pasturage depopulates a country and makes the common people extremely poor and miserable the inhabitants seem now to have a relish and a taste for industry and they feel the sweets of it in many things no people act wiser and in others it is the reverse particularly in corn when a scarcity happens they all run to the plow next year corn is a drugg the dutch buy it at their own price and the poor farmers are undone the following year the plow is neglected and corn again rises to an exorbitant price and then the dutch return them their own  i am surprised said conyers that their experience has not convinced them of the necessity of granaries  they much want them replied my lord but it must be an affair of government for private persons would be ruined in their fortunes or characters by such a scheme  by what i have heard said conyers it is a plentiful country and very cheap  true answered lady harriot and yet it is made much dearer than in england if provisions be a third cheaper and the fashion of the country obliges the use of double quantities must it not be more expensive  well well said lady mountworth suppose it dearer and that they are not so rich as in england they live well they are a generous hospitable people and have spirits and cheerfulness not to be purchased by mere wealth if they have faults show me a nation without them  my mistress said my lord is quite an irish woman  i believe said she my dear means i am quite unprejudiced but granting i was otherwise ought i not to regard that kingdom that maintains us i wish every one did the same and then their poverty and folly would not be so conspicuous  we are told said the captain that the english charter schools are in a very flourishing condition and will in time make it a protestant kingdom  yes replied my lord they are greatly and very justly encouraged but it will take time to complete so laudable a work and donations are still wanting  though it is the king of all charities yet i think my plan would much shorten it  suppose the legislator vested one hundred thousand pounds in the hands of a few trustees of known integrity and judgment to be applied in purchasing lands in some particular counties and letting those lands in small farms to poor protestant swiss or palatines naturalized and to protestant husbandmen of our own kingdoms these farms should be rent free for three years pay a small matter for three years more and raise it in such a proportion as should be judged equitable till by degrees the lands paid the full value but not of the improved rent they should have fee farm leases but not suffered to sell or alienate the lands in any shape for a certain number of years without the consent of the trustees  such a scheme properly executed would certainly in the first instance be expensive to the government but it would as certainly soon fill the country with industrious and faithful subjects and return to that government a tenfold interest  as england said the captain has purchased that kingdom by much blood and treasure perhaps they are too severe in their conduct toward it all confess the policy of france and their constant maxim is to grant more privileges to their conquered provinces and towns than they allow the interior of the kingdom  on this said my lord i shall not argue but take ireland in general and you will find them tolerably happy if all the proper use be not made of so large a kingdom england will at last discover her error and rectify it i must say for the honor of ireland that no nation ever made in so short a time such wonderful improvements and i must add that england has been in many instances extremely generous and england begins already to feel and perceive the utility of it  as to france continued my lord i am convinced that her great strength lies not in the vast superiority of her dominions we are told that great britain and ireland are to france as  00 to  0  her chief power consists in the equal distribution of benefits to the whole and in her scheme for making a formerly divided people now think and act as one man  were we so true to our own interest  were we so industrious to procure to each other a reciprocal advantage  did we manage every inch of territory for the benefit of the whole community and not sacrifice the bounties of nature to the private interest of a few great britain in reality would hold the balance of europe  lady harriot smiled and said i cannot but wonder at the vast pains my lord takes about ireland when with all his consideration he cannot change the nature of things but must leave them almost where he found them if he could persuade the rulers of the state to think like him then indeed i should have a chance of seeing ireland planted like a garden  give me leave to tell you replied my lord that i apprehend it the indispensible duty of every faithful subject to throw out such information and hints to the government as he judges of general use should he err in his conjectures perhaps they may give birth to somewhat really beneficial in any case his good intentions will at least deserve praise  i am not such a windmill fighter as to pretend to amend the world yet i hope your ladyship will indulge me an attempt to amend my little share of it and show others a good example  according to my notions this is almost as essential a part of my duty as to fear god and honor the king neither can it justly be said i do one or the other without it  such was the general run of conversation  they pleased and instructed each other  they spoke of things with freedom but of persons with goodnature  they had no conception of the joys of turning all into ridicule  of the pleasure of sarcasm nor of the delight of finding out faults and magnifying them  no  they had souls above the vulgar topic of slander  they loved mankind and mankind loved them  a yatcht attended for my lord and family and they arrived safe in dublin the   th of april    0 they stayed a short time in that city and then set out for bountyhall his lordships tenants met him on the road and their unfeigned joy is past description  as soon as conyers perceived the venerable seat wherein he had experienced so much humanity and so many blessings his heart swelled with gratitude every tender sensation rushed so violently on him that he was scarce able to speak lady harriot observed his countenance changed and was dreadfully frightened as were my lord and lady with some difficulty he got into the house and begged to lie down a few minutes and all would be well but no persuasion could remove lady harriot from his bedside he indulged his tears and permitted them to flow in silence and unperceived by lady harriot  in two hours he was quite recovered and joined the family to their inexpressible joy  though he took care not to enquire for particular persons yet he soon found that the good the honest mr kindly had been dead above two years this was a mortifying blow and cost him many sighs he had often figured to his mind the joy the old man would receive when he discovered himself which he intended to do by reclaiming his old waistcoat and tattered breeches  all the gratitude he had resolved to show this good man he now determined to transplant to his family  mr cassock had been minister of the parish eleven years and his wife was well and had a fine family of children these he fixed in his thoughts  the old butler and mrs mathews were dead  mademoiselle le meagre was old but lived happily with mrs cassock on a pension from my lord the goodnatured groom was a favorite coachman and had a considerable farm and was well married conyers determined in himself to do him service  he viewed the land with the utmost pleasure but it was so changed and the inhabitants and little houses so altered and so decent that all seemed enchantment with difficulty could he persuade himself that eighteen years could make such a wonderful change  such is the power of good management and such the effect of industry  captain conyers was in such vast delight that he feared he should discover himself improperly and determined to watch a convenient opportunity of opening his heart to my lord  thus they lived for two months when an addition was made to the general joy in short lady harriot could no longer hide a pregnancy which she had taken great pains to conceal  he soon found out that his good friend doctor st amor now bishop of  lived about twenty miles from bountyhall which determined him to make an excuse for visiting that part of the country  he waited on the good man from whose character it is easy to guess how the captain was received for advancement had only made him if possible more humble  those who cannot imagine the beauty of goodnautre tenderness love and gratitude must be very unhappy and to attempt to describe what they do not understand would be as absurd as to do it to those who have that blessing  conyers told him his situation and begged his advice and assistance in properly bringing about a discovery to lord mountworth  the bishop took it on himself but an accident turned it another way  a few days after his return my lord heard of an estate to be sold in the next county and that the proprietor was in waterford he knew the lands and the owner and so much wished to have his son fixed there that he proposed a journey to waterford as the shortest and surest way of coming to an agreement no doubt the ladies were in some trouble particularly lady harriot but his lordship raillied them out of such whimsies and in three days set out on this expedition  chap xxiii not he of wealth immense possessed tasteless who piles his massy gold among the number of the blessed should have his glorious name enrolled he better claims the glorious name who knows with wisdom to enjoy what heaven bestows franciss horace on their arrival at waterford they were informed that the gentleman they wanted was then at clonmell and next morning they pursued their journey to that city in the evening they traveled leisurely on and my lord was diverting him with a merry story of his youth when suddenly mr conyers cried out great god and fainted in the postchaise  his lordship in prodigious trouble stopped the chaise and all were employed in recovering the captain they took him out and no house being at hand carried him to the hut of a beggar when his senses weree recalled what was his astonishment at finding himself actually placed in his first habitation  he uttered some words that greatly affected his lordship who imagined a lightness in the brain and made him most ardently desire to be in a place where proper assistance could be had  in a little time his spirits so much revived that my lord hurried him into the chaise and the beggar had reason to be thankful for the accident  the captain was lost in thought the idea of former times was so strong and every childish circumstance recurrd so clearly to his memory that it might have been fatal to him had not his eyes given vent to the throbbings of his heart  this lasted a considerable time but he was quite himself when he arrived at clonmell  my dear conyers said my lord you give me vast pain i perceive your disorder is not occasioned by sickness but by somewhat that oppresses your mind  relieve it i beseech you and confide in me not merely as a father but as a friend  if my power or fortune can give you ease count it already done let me entreat you not to stifle your cares if you have any which must torture your imagination and keep me on the rack  heaven is my witness said mr conyers i mean not to give your lordship the least uneasiness but my lord i have such a tale of wonder to unfold that overcomes my reason  can you believe can your lordship imagine that the hovel i was just now in was my dwelling for years  my lord thought him distracted and advised him to forbear any further relation and go to rest  i see said mr conyers your lordship thinks my mind is disturbed  it is true but my reason is clear  oh my lord i am not capable of injurious deceits but that i have deceived you is certain my dear son replied the good lord i know your honor and your virtue but i know not of a deceit  yes my lord answered conyers you are my father  your bounty raised me  your humanity supported my infant weakness  your virtues formed my soul  the will of the almighty has conducted my steps and now throws at your feet the poor  the helpless  the abandoned jack connor  lord mountworth was all amazement  he forgot mr conyers was on his knees but gazing with eyes of astonishment at last he raised him and looked again  when he had fully brought to his memory the long unthoughtof features of jack connor he flew with transport to his arms  gracious heaven cried he how unsearchable are thy ways  oh my dear jack you have amply  amply rewarded the kindness i have shown you  you are now mine by every tie  if your lordship said conyers can pardon the only fallacy i was ever guilty of you will a second time give me life and being  my dear jack replied my lord you every moment give me new pleasure  i think you are now my son more than ever  but my child tell my impatient ear how this wonder has happened  tell me how it is possible when mr johnston was so certain of your being drowned that i now find now hold you in my arms  i shall answered mr conyers most faithfully inform your lordship of every part of my life but the hurry of my spirits is so great and my imagination so filled with the vicissitudes of my fortune that i am unable at present to utter any part  all i can now say is most humbly to thank your lordship for your humanity and bounty to a poor distressed helpless infant and to beseech you to believe that nothing but real love of my dearest harriot and the dread of losing her could have prevented a sooner discovery forgive this crime my lord if love can be a a crime and your lordship may be assured that my duty my gratitude and every sentiment of an honest heart shall for ever wait on you and on every creature for whom you have the least friendship or regard  my dear son said my lord i can easily judge of the pleasing anxiety you are in but retire to rest and may gentle sleep restore your peace and tranquillity and may heaven long continue it  next morning lord mountworth in the most affectionate manner embraced conyers and called him his son  his friend  permit me said the captain to ask your lordship if you can give me any account of mr johnstons niece nannett  to the best of my memory said my lord she married mr lilly the usher about the time you left the school your old master died six years ago and mr lilly continues the former plan of tuition with great credit  now i am satisfied said conyers and now give me leave to recount every circumstance of my story and your lordship will observe the visible hand of providence conducting and leading me to the fruition of the most perfect happiness this world can afford  it has conducted me to the arms of the dearest and best of wives and to the sight of the noblest and best of men  heaven i beseech thee make me most truly thankful  he then began the narrative of his life which if the reader has forgot he has my permission to read again for i have not time to recapitulate  every incident and change of his life gave his lordship fresh matter for wonder but what struck him the most was his being the son of sir roger thornton who had married his sister  i shall ever said he admire your prudence in keeping your affairs so secret and i shall always honor your laudable ambition and gratitude  when our dear harriot has blessed you with a child both she and my dear wife shall partake of the joy your story has given me and my son harry must share in the pleasure  as for sir roger he must know nothing of it for he has a certain pride in his nature that would soon divulge it to the world and perhaps not in its genuine colors  for my own part my dearest jack i am so far from being ashamed of your alliance that i glory in it yet my son i would not choose to be the constant theme of the ignorant  titles are but the rewards of merit but pride and haughtiness debase them  distinctions are only incentives to noble deeds and true nobility will ever encourage them  charity and tenderness are the characteristicks of a man and did mankind love truth and honor more than pride falsehood and detraction the occurrences of your life would strengthen their resolves and convince all  that to be really happy they must be truly virtuous  gentle reader  right sorry is the compiler of this work that his materials can carry him no further and he is not permitted to to search into futurity should our good jack connor or captain conyers live thirty or forty years longer perhaps he will furnish matter for a much abler historian the work thou have now read has been little altered from the original papers but some observations or rather slight hints have been added and are the result of not a little experience of sixty years  if thou find errors reprove with freedom but judge of the intention  if thou applaudest any one part of the moral thou will make the compiler happy as he will imagine thou will follow the precept  to the wellminded to the honest man he says from shakespeares coriolanus  i have done as you have done that is what i can induced as you have been that is for my country he that has but effected his good will has overtaen mine act farewell finis stultus versus sapientem in three letters to the fool joculare tibi videtur and sane loeve dum nihil habemus majus calamo ludimus sed diligenter intuere has noenias quantum sub illis utilitatem reperies phaed  the bookseller to the reader the history of jack connor having met with so favorable a reception in great britain and ireland that my interest obliged me to give this second edition though books of amusement do not always meet the same fate no pains has been wanting to make this impression as complete as the nature of the work would admit of  some gentlemen have insisted on my rescuing the following letters from oblivion by adding them to this volume and i was the easier prevailed on as they bear some analogy to the foregoing history  i find these letters were printed in london in the paper called the fool at a time when it was under the consideration of parliament whether they should or should not continue the bounty on the lowpricd linens of ireland  if irony merits your attention or regard these letters cannot fail of giving you some pleasure which i shall ever be happy by contributing to  letter i to the fool dear cousin london      had i sooner discovered the honor i have of being nearly related to you sooner had i paid my respects to the worthy head of so illustrious a family  to convince you of my sincere love untainted with flattery permit me grievously to complain to you  of yourself the constant maxim of our glorious ancestors was by their writings their eloquence and every other lawful means to encourage promote and if possible make universal the great doctrine of folly but with an aching heart i speak it you seem to dwindle from the fundamental rule into downright understanding and sense  consider my dear cousin that whilst you are musing yourself with such trifles your natural enemies gain ground nay a whole neighboring kingdom have lately taken up arms against us who for many centuries were our firmest friends and allies  your inherent goodfoolishness will naturally imagine i mean ireland  this mighty monarchy for ages governed by kings of our house  this extensive realm famous for the title of isle of saints the indelible character of our noble family  this state peculiarly cherished and fed by our spiritual father the pope  and yet to our shame be it spoken this so valuable a part of our dominions is likely to be wrested from us  yes sir we shall soon lose our ancient inheritance except we exert all our faculties and by vigorous and antisalutary schemes prevent what must be so fatal to our interest  lest truth should not have reached your ears as what monarch always hears it permit me to inform you of the present conduct of this degenerate nation  your foolishness will scarcely believe the melancholy tidings i bring  you will not be able to conceive that these your old friends now hold your authority and family in the utmost contempt  that they have already trampled down numbers of your altars and high places and that all hands are employed to finish the execrable work  believe me sir this misguided people are totally employed in promoting manufactures labor and industry strange revolution  as poor and deluded as they are they have stumbled on a project that will infallibly ruin our credit  they have set the axe to the root and the mighty tree that yielded the plentiful and delicious fruit of pardons indulgencies and a thousand other sorts no less grateful to the soul must fall and with it all our hopes  in short sir the wretches seem determined to make it a protestant kingdom  i tremble at the consequence  blind zeal urges them on they give their money with cheerfulness to promote their darling scheme of english protestant working schools  i beg leave sir to set this matter before you in its true light that your foolishness may consider of ways and means to prevent their spreading  i am very well informed that this kingdom from n to s is about     miles and from e to w about   0 and contains about eighteen millions of statute acres with commodious harbors bays and rivers  henry the second stole it from your ancestors  many struggles were made by our good friends to shake off this yoke but in vain  at that period vulgarly called the reformation your friends held fast to mother church but still protestantism impudently raised her head and shamefully flourished to such an height she grew that in      when england was torn by civil war our natural safety obliged and our holy catholic church compelled us for the sake of salvation to extirpate our enemies the glorious call was unhappily obeyed but in part for their fell in that night but about one hundred thousand of them  that archfiend oliver cromwell greatly disturbed our peace and holy ignorance his enthusiastic sword swept all before him his madness drove multitudes to america and numbers into one corner of the land where still your name is in some veneration  the total ruin of your empire was too arduous a task even for oliver for on mustering our forces in      we found ourselves    to one  again we struggled and followed the standard of your illustrious godfather king james the second  though the prince of orange was our most inveterate foe though he had a little courage great cunning and a tolerable army our hopes were high and we might have succeeded had not that abominable filthy town and neighborhood of enniskillen raised a regiment of horse and one of foot of as rank protestants as ever occupied church lands and sent them and their hearts to the prince  oh fatal hour  our enemies triumph in it and preserve these regiments even until this very day  from that time these miscreants have been but too careful in framing and what is worse putting in execution sundry laws destructive of our ancient rights thus have they proceeded for these sixty years without the least check and have so artfully managed their affairs that withal the machinations and contrivances of sundry potentates your friends and allies they never could be brought even to think of rebellion in support of your foolishness or family except with horror  so averse were these savages to your gentle sway that whilst numbers of our relations marched even into the heart of england in your cause they the protestants raised upwards of sixty thousand horse and foot well armed regimented and mostly uniformly clothed and effectually guarded ireland in spite of your legal prerogative and indefeasible hereditary right  i had a degree of happiness on being informed that in      our friends there were about seven to one enemy  but alas sir on further enquiry i am but too well convinced that in fifty years you or your posterity will not have a single heart warm in your cause  the encouragement given to husbandry manufactures arts and sciences is monstrous even beyond what any other nation ever did  they have inverted the whole order of nature they have extracted corn from our old venerable boggs and feed millions of sheep and oxen on those plains anciently consecrated to holy and religious uses  but what will not impiety do  they have infatuated the native irish to such a decree that they beg and pray to have their children admitted into these cursed protestant schools now erected in most parts of the kingdom to the number of  0  in these seminaries they are taught to read the bible and instructed in their religion for about two hours every day and the remainder of their time still more infamously employed in tilling the land spinning weaving or some other manual operations unknown to their forefathers  the fund to answer this great expense arises from what they call the charity of well disposed christians and so prevalent is this specious title that a king whom your foolishness never heard of even george the second has granted them a charter and set an example to his subjects by a donation of one thousand pounds a year  an example but too well followed by numbers of weak minds in this kingdom  i really always imagined that these contributors were of the lowest order of the people but great was my surprise to find at a late meeting so many of the first fashion and reputation in the kingdom as they are men of dangerous and turbulent spirits always plotting and contriving our ruin they must by some means or other be diverted from this work  your foolishness will certainly demand and say  where are my holy priests  they are idle  they are idle  no sir accuse them not they are there and in numbers and at work with all their might but these subtle protestants take from them the tools they work with by transplanting the innocent children many miles distant from their native parishes by which contrivance their parents or priests are prevented from frightening them with purgatory and hell or keeping them firm in the cause of indolence and rags  for now above   00 of these little reptiles cloth themselves  permit me sir in my next to lay before you a few remarks and some schemes to render useless the machinations of all your enemies being  your true and most affectionate kinsman thomas a stupidius  letter ii to the fool dear cousin london      in the last i had the honor of writing to you i traced out the rise and progress of wisdom in your ancient kingdom of ireland  permit me a little to continue the subject and then i shall mention my ways for making their wisdom abortive  some of their wise heads have found out that ireland contains about two millions of inhabitants and they have likewise found out that the riches and prosperity of a nation are in proportion to their inhabitants properly employed  such a discovery was infinitely against the true interest of our family  on this they built and then computed the value to the government of every industrious individual which i think they made amount to about ten pounds a year  they then proceeded by a thing called arithmetic  if one industrious subject  be worth ten pounds a year to the state  what will be the value of two millions of such subjects  and such is the power of figures they made it plain that that number was really worth twenty millions each year  in order to acquire such riches the first care of these avaritious gentry was to poison the minds of their tenants with notions of industry  no easy task but as they knew that the popish religion  their having such swarms of priests to maintain  their number of holy days  and their natural disposition to sauntering were so many drawbacks to wealth honesty and cleanliness it was thought necessary to change the religion of the people and make them spurn at our holy institutions  this cruel blow has been but too well followed  their labor and industry have matched with such gigantick strides that within these twenty years the whole face of the country is changed  now the traveller journies on roads the finest in europe and reposes himself not in barns or hovels but in good clean and commodious houses  he may in time be entertained with all the beauties of the country heightened and improved by art and industry  he may behold useful and ornamental structures arise and see gardens and plantations flourish  these indeed would be shocking sights  it is amazing to observe how the trivial praemiums of a little society in dublin have spurred on greedy minds  scarcely has any branch of manufacture or useful art escaped their notice and encouragement  such low creatures are they that they ransack even the dunghills and give praemiums to the old women who gather most rags to make paper  should our schemes oblige the rebels to return to your obedience i would except these fellows out of the general pardon  what have we not to fear should industry like other novelties become a fashion in ireland  industry the parent of every social virtue  the founder of all real honor  the support of government and preserver of true religion  property is her constant attendant and liberty gives her spirits freely to enjoy it  virtue property and liberty are not concomitants of our constitution they must be banished or your foolishness will be deposed therefore the protestant working schools must be destroyed  hitherto sir i have considered this matter in its worst light but be assured your foolishness has many and powerful friends both here and in ireland who constantly espouse your cause these forces properly collected and well posted must make a powerful diversion and greatly retard the operations of the enemy  our friends in the conclave and sorbonne perfectly understand the noble doctrine  divide and govern  through all the labyrinths of policy from xenophon and tacitus to richlieu and antimachiavel this maxim is the soul and essence  when it fails i know but of a poniard or poison that can supply its place  rightly to divide we must subdivide truth or in other words we must propagate falsehoods it is certain that lying is a sin the vulgar only can commit for all the princes of your house gloried in it and your foolishness follows those bright examples  let it be privately hinted that the whole affair is a jobb and a contrivance to cousen the weak  assert possitively that every donation to these scandalous working schools centers in the pockets of particular persons  or where these schools are really erected it is but with a view of augmenting the estate of the lord of the manor by having so many slaves to work for him gratis thanks be to ignorance thousands of your liege subjects will subscribe to these articles with implicit faith  though it happens that great britain and ireland are governed by the same monarch and the same laws and though the principal inhabitants of the latter spring from the former yet nature indulgent to your interest has divided them by a little sea  be it therefore our peculiar care to divide their minds by encouraging jealousy and the salutary seeds of derision and animosity  by all means prevent the english from ever getting the better of their prejudices to the irish and keep the irish in a perpetual envious disposition to the english for though we cannot prevent their being in fact but one and the same people this conduct will give them two distinct minds and make their union useless  every instrument must be employed to keep up the general opinion that ireland must be bridled and curbed  never permit them to discover that it would be unjust to make different laws for the isle of wight or that the county of surry should have less freedom than the county of middlesex because the thames divides them  how fatal had it been to our good cause and to our faithful friends the disturbers of europe had ireland been joined to the narrow part of the western shore of england  they would then have been all protestants  this kingdom would have been two thirds larger than it is  have had four or five millions more of inhabitants and a proportionable increase of taxes to the government consequently the government less in debt if at all or if in debt better enabled to pay that debt  france and spain would have been unsupplied with irish officers and soldiers who happen though our relations not to be the worst of the profession  that your foolishness has many friends of different orders cannot be denied but the two most firm in your interest are those gentlemen of england who regard the other isle but with a certain degree of contempt and view the inhabitants but as aliens to the state and those gentlemen of ireland who contemning her newadopted maxims live out of her pale nor visit her but by their proxies in the form of bills of exchange  these are our true and genuine subjects meriting every honor your foolishness can confer on them  it must be confessed there are some poor and dastardly spirits in this kingdom who afraid of exerting their power over the other have unaccountably run into the opposite extreme and joined with all their might to promote their linen manufacture nay their monarch and most of his nobility feel it every day on their tables their backs and in their beds  too serious a truth  i have been informed that in      their whole export of linen cloth amounted to about ten thousand pounds but now  can you believe it  it is swelled to above a million this has so enraged me i am not at present able to proceed but permit me to refer your foolishness to my next and always be assured of the utmost sincerity of  your most faithful and affectionate kinsman thomas a stupidius  letter iii to the fool dear cousin london      join with me to curse the memory of the old wretch who invented the fable of the belly and members certainly it contains more wisdom than half the modern folios from this tale sprung every faint endeavor to make these three kingdoms subservient to the interest of each other and be in reality one great and mighty empire but their boasted tria juncta in uno is merely ideal for our family have ever found means nor wanted interest to make ineffectual such pernicious schemes  linen gave rise to industry in ireland  industry soon showed her alluring charms and diffused her baneful influence over the land ten thousand odious beauties issued from her and at last produced these horrid working schools which must make it a protestant kingdom and consequently enrich england by an addition of some millions of useful and faithful subjects  england discovered this benefit and wisely encouraged the irish linen but particularly by the bounty they allowed on its being exported to foreign countries the effects were soon felt in ireland and the creatures expressed their awkward gratitude by running in crowds to the hackle and loom  as this is the source of all our misfortunes in ireland let all our attention be given to ruin it which when once effected believe me sir they will fly with more alacrity to bend the knee before you than they did to rebel against your authority  let us not tamely submit to see triumphant those monsters industry and protestantism  our troops are still numerous and in good order but alas of what use if not led to on action  your foolishness knows that some of the northern provinces of this kingdom have embarked in this branch of business  a most lucky incident which if properly improved all your wishes will be accomplished  let us magnify their performances  let us invent plausible tales of the progress they have made and fee our friend sophistry to demonstrate that the interest of england requires their being greatly supported and encouraged and then your faithful minister cunning may slyly insinuate that ireland can now stand alone nor needs the usual bounty which by all true policy ought to bend its course due north  i am in raptures at the thought  pursue it sir in the name of ignorance and instantly you will see all their mighty fabric tumble to the ground and your fame will be exalted for ever  ireland must then infallibly become a drain of riches from england and not a source of plenty  she may want assistance from england but will never be able to return the compliment  thus enervated no more can she support thirty seven regiments of british subjects always ready to obey their monarch  she may indeed have an army quartered on her but their pay must issue from the same fountain which supplies the army in scotland  her present absentees must then become resident for by ruining this her only branch of valuable commerce she can never send out the twentieth part of the annual million she now bestows on them  it is impossible to mention the innumerable advantages arising to us from such a project well executed  rome would be glad and france rejoice at it  ignorance would triple her number of beads sloth would multiply her pleasant bogs and indolence live magnificently in smoke and mudwalls in fine all our family to the most distant relation would be properly and munificently provided for and your throne established as in the days of roderick oconnor of gallant memory  it is in vain to attempt in england a thorough reformation in our favor but we can always throw in such bars to their happiness and so weaken the nerves and sinews of their government that all their conquests over us shall avail them little or perhaps even become a charge to them  dullness be praised all thoughts are now dropped of making ireland a corn country i own i am surprised their clergy do not attempt it as it would so much increase their tithes they have talked of public granaries but it was mere talk nor shall i remind them of it  indeed an attempt was once made to encourage tillage by granting as in england a bounty on corn exported but your foolishness nobly exerted yourself on that occasion and defeated the project you rightly judged that though pasturage employed the land it was in no shape so prejudicial to your interest as ploughing which fills a country with laborious inhabitants  without vanity i may say i gave the first hint of restraining ireland with regard to wool and then i dexterously contrived that the english might smuggle it as well as themselves the happy consequence is that thousands of the french are amused in manufacturing of it whilst as many of your rebel subjects are starving at home  to my great joy this cannot suddenly be altered for so long as the irish love mutton and feed millions of sheep and so long as they have more wool than their home consumption requires so long will they act on the principles of their neighbors and sell it to the best bidder  perhaps your foolishness will be surprised that so large a kingdom as france or spain should want irish or english wool but  let me wisper in your ear  all their wool cannot make one piece of serge  why this is so leeds and every clothing town in england can better explain than i  should they ever attempt a change in this matter let us get a borough or two to petition against it and order your brother clamor to attend  they are truly in this respect in the way we wish them in nor do i believe they will alter till they are convinced that it is more eligible to encourage the subjects of ireland in some certain branches of trade than by a contrary conduct drive those branches into the arms of the common enemy  the general rule and the most successful is eternally to play
