i advertisement from the editor citizenness roland the wife of a man of science was persuaded that the celebrity of a woman ought to be confined to the esteem arising from the practice of domestic virtues on this account she always refused to publish writings which would have procured her literary fame it was even necessary to be intimately acquainted with her and enjoy her confidence to be enabled to form a just estimate of her native merit her acquired talents and the strength of her character citizenness roland the wife of a minister retained the same principles she assisted her husband in his political labours as she had before assisted him in his scientific pursuits without suffering her name to appear ii but her situation was changed before she was confined within a narrow circle of friends now become the centre of a numerous group the enthusiastic admiration of her friends and the invidious malevolence of her enemies soon combined to give her that renown which she was still far from seeking imprisoned calumniated on all sides having nought but the scaffold before her citizenness roland could not avoid seeking the esteem of posterity to console her for the injustice of her contemporaries and future glory as an indemnification for premature death then alone she appeared to separate her reputation from that of her husband then alone she assumed the pen to make herself known as an individual and to furnish materials for history in her own name it will be seen however that the sole desire of her own reputation and her own fame determined not her resolution every page will show that she was particularly animated with the duty of repelling the calumnious charges accumulated against her husband and revenging the memory of roland if he should not have it in his power to write or publish his last justification the public already prejudiced in her favour will iii judge from a perusal of her writings whether she were really deserving of the commendations bestowed on her by her friends and whether she did not deserve the hatred of the villains who finally condemned her to the block malevolence assuming the mask of criticism will endeavour no doubt to depreciate this monument erected by a woman to the glory of her sex but the impartial reader will discover her traits i will only say as an excuse for some superfluous relations and some negligences of style that citizenness roland composed the part entitled historical memoirs two thirds of which and those the most interesting are loft in the space of one month and all the rest in two and twenty days in the midst of vexations and disquietudes of every kind and that the manuscript had very few corrections many persons whose characters citizenness roland has given will have to complain of her posterity must decide whether she have judged them well or ill i have confined myself strictly to the office of an editor and not permitted myself to make the least alteration in the text even when it was evident that she had been mistaken there is a passage for instance where she seems to cast suspicions on citizen iv dulaure which i believe him far from deserving and which every true republican will be eager to repel it may not be amiss here to relate the cause of her errour dulaure a patriotic journalist and a writer of courage visited roland whose principles were analogous to his own and whose conduct he esteemed dulaure a deputy to the convention thought it incumbent on him as a matter of delicacy to desist from frequenting the house of a minister of whose actions he was constituted a judge citizenness roland attributed this reserve to a change of opinion in politics and to the instigation of the mountaineers hence the gall which seems to have predominated when she wrote the article concerning him but in which notwithstanding she does his character the justice it deserves the courage with which citizen dulaure has printed all the complaints of citizenness roland since the   st of may the honourable proscription he has undergone and his last publication entitled supplement to the crimes of the late committees of government render farther justification unnecessary it was my intention to have given the public the whole of the work at once but the delays v of the press at the present moment and the observations of some good citizens have determined me to publish it in parts there will be four which will follow each other as speedily as circumstances will permit the second will be filled with several detached pieces respecting the events of the revolution and the papers that relate to her death or immediately preceded it the third and fourth will contain her private life written precisely after the manner and with the intentions of the confessions of rousseau to which will be added some familiar letters which i have found amongst my papers i much lament that i have not a more complete series of her correspondence to publish it is in the essusions of friendship that the mind displays itself fully and our opinions inclinations and acquirements exhibit themselves unveiled hence i consider these letters though at first view they appear to concern only our friendship tastes and studies as necessary supplements to her private memoirs in them will be seen how ardent a republican she was from the first and certainly on the   th of august      she could vi not possibly foresee that france would become a republic still less that she was destined to act a part in it citizenness roland was very fond of exercising her pen in epistolary writing she employed it on all subjects with incredible facility and much grace as a letterwriter she was superiour in my opinion to a sevigné or a maintenon because she was far better informed than either of those two celebrated women and her correspondence consisted of things not words i wish to collect all her letters that may have been preserved which i here request them who are in possession of them to send me in the original free of expense as far as possible and i propose to publish them at the end of several literary productions of citizenness roland which are known to me and which i think worthy of seeing the light roland during his retreat had also composed some historical memoirs but they were consigned to the flames the moment the courageous woman who concealed him was taken into custody at the conclusion of his first ministry he published a collection of pieces calculated to make known to posterity his vii conduct in office and i intend to continue it by collecting such as relate to his second ministry but that i may be enabled to accomplish this object as well as the preceding one it is requisite that the national convention either by a general law solicited by all the friends of justice or a private decree desired by every true friend of liberty restore to the daughter of roland the property to which she has a just claim i must have liberty to search amongst the papers still under seal at villefranche as well as those taken from the house at paris after the sale of the furniture by the agents of the national domains it is the part of all sincere republicans victims of tyranny persecuted for their virtues or talents as roland and his wife to favour my wishes with their influence and promote the restoration of my engaging ward to all her rights let me be permitted to conclude with a single observation perhaps not unnecessary this work is at least at present the sole fortune of eudora the beloved daughter the only child of roland woe be to the villain who dares to pirate it for certainly he would not be able to sell one copy of it yet i would not fail to call down upon him all the vengeance of the law viii the portrait of citizenness roland engraved by the worthy pasquier the countryman of roland and the friend of them both ought to have been placed at the beginning of the first part but it cannot be gotten ready for delivery till the publication of the last bosc paris germinal  0 in the year of the republic   april          historical memoirs citizenness roland june      abbey prison of the abbey june      now on a throne to morrow in a prison such is the sate of virtue at the period of revolutions after the first commotions of a people wearied out with the abuses with which it had been aggrieved have subsided the sages who have instructed it in its rights and assisted it in regaining them are called into places of authority but these they cannot long occupy for the ambitious eager to avail themselves of circumstances soon mislead the people by flattery and turn it against its real defenders to raise themselves into consequence and power this has been the progress of things particularly since the tenth of august some day perhaps i shall take them up from an earlier date to retrace with my pen what my situation has enabled me to know at present my sole object is to commit to paper the circumstances of my arrest an amusement natural to the solitary who pourtrays what affects himself and expresses what he feels the resignation of roland appeased not his enemies he had quitted the ministry in spite of his resolves to lay the storm and brave every danger   because the state of the council when he became fully acquainted with it and his weakness continually increasing and strongly marked about the middle of january presented nothing to his view but faults and follies of which he must participate the disgrace he was not even allowed to enter on the register of the deliberations his opinions or his motives when they were contrary to the determination of the majority thus from the day of that pitiful decree respecting the piece of lami des loix the friend of the laws which he would not sign because the second branch of it was at least ridiculous he no longer affixed his signature to any of the deliberations of the council this was the fifteenth of january in the convention he discovered nothing to afford him encouragement there his very name was become the signal of discord and disturbance it was no longer permitted to be pronounced without uproar if a member ventured to answer the odious accusations gratuitously preferred against the minister he was treated as an instrument of faction and compelled to be silent yet pache in the war department was committing every fault into which his weakness and implicit submission to the jacobins or the persidy and audaciousness of his agents could lead him and the convention could not obtain the dismissal of pache for the moment a single voice lifted itself against him the barkers retorted the name of roland thus the continuation of his courageous contest in the ministry could no longer restrain the faults of the council whilst it became an additional motive of disorder in the convention he gave in therefore his resignation that the   sound part of the legislative body thoroughly convinced as it was of the virtues and talents of the calumniated minister durst not make a single obsertion on the subject sufficiently proves its necessity this was unquestionably weakness for it needed a firm and honest minister in the home department who would have been its most powerful stay and losing this it must submit to the yoke of the extravagants who sought to raise up and maintain an authority capable of rivalling the national representation roland supported an usurping commune roland impressed on all the administrative bodies an uniform harmonious and regular motion he watched over the supply of provision to the grand family he had established peace in all the departments and inspired them with that order which springs from justice that confidence which arises from vigilant administration an affectionate correspondence and the communication of knowledge roland therefore ought to have been supported but weakness refused the means and he who knew well that weakness had nothing left him to do but to withdraw the timid garat an amiable man in society of moderate talents as a man of letters and contemptible as a member of administration whose being chosen minister of justice proved the want of men of capacity a want which they only can know who occupying places of importance have coadjutors to seek had not sense enough to remain in that office where there is least to be done and in which his infirm health natural indolence and incapacity for business must have been least conspicuous he removed to   the home department without possessing one of the branches of knowledge it demands not only with respect to politics but in regard to commerce the arts and innumerable minutiæ that come under its cognizance with his ignorance and inactivity he attempted to supply the place of the most active man in the republic and the best informed in all these points the looseness of the machine soon disjointed its parts and proved the weakness of the regulator the departments were thrown into commotion scarcity was felt and the flames of civil war were lighted up in vendée the authorities of paris began to encroach the jacobins assumed the reins of government the puppet pache dismissed from the department which he had unhinged was raised by the cabal to the mayoralty where his suppleness was wanted and replaced at the councilboard by the idiot bouchotte as supple as he and even exceeding him in stupidity roland gave a terrible blow to his adversaries by publishing on his retirement such accounts as no minister before him had furnished to have examined them and sanctioned them by a report was a piece of justice which he must have solicited in vain for that would have been to acknowledge the falsehood of the obloquy thrown on him the infamy of his detractors and the weakness of the convention that durst not undertake his defence it was necessary to persevere in slandering him without coming to the proof to blind and mislead the public opinion with respect to him so as to be able to ruin him with impunity and thus to remove   a troublesome witness of so many atrocities which must be concealed or justified to preserve to those who committed them that wealth and authority in the acquirement of which they were instrumental in vain did roland intreat publish and write seven times in four months to the convention to demand an examination and report on his conduct in the ministry the jacobins continued to employ their satellites to proclaim him as a traitor marat proved to his fellows that his head was necessary to the tranquillity of the republic conspiracies frustrated renewed strangled in the birth yet again revived terminated at length in the insurrection of the   st of may when the good people of paris with a fixed determination to massacre no one did every thing its audacious directors its insolent commune and the revolutionary committee of messieurs the jacobins become fools madmen or the hirelings of the enemy chose to dictate roland had written the eighth time to the convention which did not even deign to read his letter i was preparing to get passports signed by the municipality that i might go with my daughter into the country to which i was called by domestic business the state of my health and many good reasons amongst other things i considered how much more easy it would be for roland alone to withdraw from the pursuit of his enemies should they proceed to the last excess than if he were with his little family prudence urged the diminution of the points in which he could be attacked my passports had been delayed   at the section through the chicanery of some zealous maratists in whose eyes i was an object of suspicion and they were but just delivered to me when a fit of the nervous colic attended with violent convulsions the sole indisposition to which i am liable and to which the vehement affections of a strong mind ruling a robust frame expose me confined me to my bed six days thus elapsed and i purposed to go out on friday to repair to the municipality the sound of the alarmbell informed me that it was not a proper time every thing had long foretold a crisis necessary this it is true threatened from the ascendency of the jacobins to be unfavourable to the real friends of liberty but energetic minds detest uncertainty and the debasement of the convention with its daily acts of weakness and slavery appeared to me so distressing that i almost deemed the utmost excesses preferable for these must have opened the eyes of the departments and determined their conduct the alarm gun and the commotions of the day awakened in me that interest which grand events inspire without any painful emotion two or three persons came to visit us and one in particular pressed roland to make his appearance at his section where he was well esteemed and the prudent precautions of which were the best warrants of his safety it was agreed however that he should not sleep at home the following night   though nothing was talked of but the good intentions of the citizens who arranged themselves under arms in order to oppose every act of violence but it was not added that they would permit all the preparations for acts of violence to be made the blood boils in my veins when i hear the goodness of the parisians vaunted who would have no more such days as the  d of september just heavens you are not wanted to execute another you have only to suffer it as before but you are necessary to collect the victims and you civilly lend your hands to apprehend them you are necessary to give the appearance of a legitimate insurrection to the tribunes who sway you and you approve their undertakings you obey their orders and take the oath of fealty to the monstrous authorities they create you surround the legislative body with your bayonets and you permit the decrees it is wanted to pass to be dictated to it boast then no more of being its defenders it is you who bind it in chains you who deliver into the hands of oppression its members most distinguished for their virtues and their talents and with equal cowardice see them brought to a scaffold by proceedings similar to those which destroyed sidney you who will answer for so many crimes to indignant france who serve the cause of her enemies and prepare the way for federalism think you that the proud marseilles and sage gironde will pass over the affront done to their representatives or ever fraternise with your city black with guilt you are the destroyers of your country and soon will lament in   vain in the midst of its ruins your infamous pusillanimity it was half after five in the evening when six men armed came to our house one of them read to roland an order of the revolutionary committee by the authority of which they came to apprehend him i know no law said roland which constitutes the authority you cite to me and i shall obey no orders proceeding from it if you employ violence i can only oppose to you the resistance of a man of my years but i shall protest against it to the last moment—i have no order to employ violence replied the person and i will leave my colleagues here whilst i go and report your answer to the council of the commune immediately it occurred to me that it would be well to announce this circumstance to the convention with some noise in order to prevent the arrest of roland or to obtain his prompt release if this should be carried into execution to communicate the thought to my husband write a letter to the president and set out was the business of a few minutes my servant was absent i left a friend who was in the house with roland and stepped alone into a hackneycoach which i ordered to proceed as fast as possible to the carrouzel the court of the tuileries was filled with armed men i crossed and flew through the midst of them like a bird i was dressed in a morning gown and had put on a black shawl and a veil on my arrival at the doors of the outer halls which were all shut i found sentinels who allowed no one to enter or sent me by turns from one door to another in vain i insisted on admission at length i   bethought myself of employing such language as might have been uttered by some devotee of robespierre but citizens in this day of salvation for our country in the midst of those traitors we have to fear you know not of what importance some notes i have to transmit to the president may be let me at least see one of the messengers that i may entrust them to him the door opened and i entered into the petitioners hall i inquired for a messenger of the house wait till one comes out said one of the inner sentinels a quarter of an hour passed away i perceived rôze the person who brought me the decree of the convention which invited me to repair to the bar on occasion of the ridiculous accusation of viard whom i overwhelmed with confusion now i solicited permission to appear there and announced roland to be in danger with which the public weal was connected but circumstances were no longer the same though my rights were equal before invited now a suppliant could i expect the same success rôze took charge of my letter understood the subject of my impatience and repaired to lay it on the table and urge its being read an hour elapsed i walked hastily backwards and forwards every time the door opened my eyes were cast towards the hall but it was immediately shut by the guard a fearful noise was heard at intervals rôze again appeared—well—nothing has been done yet a tumult i cannot describe prevails in the assembly some petitioners now at the bar demand the twoandtwenty to be apprehended i have just assisted rabaud to slip out without being seen they are not willing he  0 should make the report of the commission of twelve he has been threatened several others are escaping there is no knowing what will be the event—who is the president now—hérautséchelles—ah my letter will not be read send some deputy to me with whom i can speak a few words—whom—indeed i have been little acquainted or have little esteem for any but them who are proscribed tell vergniaux i am inquiring for him rôze went in quest of him after a considerable time he appeared we talked together for ten minutes he went back into the hall returned and said to me in the present state of the assembly i dare not flatter you you have little to hope if you get admission to the bar you may obtain a little more favour as a woman but the convention can do no more good—it can do every thing exclaimed i for the majority of paris seeks only to know what it has to do if i were admitted i would venture to say what you could not without exposing yourself to an accusation i fear nothing and if i cannot save roland i will utter with energy truths which will not be useless to the republic inform your worthy colleagues a burst of courage may have a great effect and at least will set a great example—in fact i was in that temper of mind which imparts eloquence warm with indignation superiour to all fear my bosom glowing for my country the ruin of which i foresaw every thing dear to me in the world exposed to the utmost danger feeling strongly expressing my sentiments with fluency too proud not to utter them with dignity i had subjects in which i was highly interested    to discuss possessed some means of defending them and was in a singular situation for doing it with advantage—but at any rate your letter cannot be read this hour or two a plan of a decree forming six articles is going to be discussed petitioners deputed by the sections wait at the bar think what an attempt—i will go home then to hear what has passed and will immediately return so tell our friends—most of them are absent they show themselves courageous when they are here but they are deficient in assiduity—that is unfortunately too true i quitted vergniaux i flew to louvets i wrote a note to inform him of what was going on and what i foresaw i flung myself into a hackneycoach and ordered it home the poor horses answered not the speed of my wishes soon we were met by some battalions whose march stopped us i jumped out of the coach paid the coachman rushed through the ranks and made off this was near the louvre i ran to our house which was opposite st côme in harpstreet the porter whispered me that roland was gone into the landlords at the bottom of the court thither i repaired in a profuse perspiration a glass of wine was brought me and i was told that the bearer of the mandate of arrest having returned without being able to procure a hearing at the council roland had persisted in protesting against his orders and that these good people had demanded his protest in writing and had then withdrawn after which roland went through the landlords apartment and got out of the house the back way i did the same    to find him to inform him of what i had done and to acquaint him with the steps i meant to pursue at the first house to which i repaired i found him not in the second i did from the solitariness of the streets which were illuminated i presumed it was late yet this did not prevent my design of returning to the convention there i would have appeared ignorant of rolands escape and spoken as i had before intended i was about to set off on foot without being conscious that it was past ten oclock and that i was out that day for the first time since my illness which demanded rest and the bath a hackneycoach was brought me on approaching the carrouzel i saw nothing more of the armed force two pieces of cannon and a few men were still at the gate of the national palace i went up to it and found the sitting was dissolved what on the day of an insurrection when the sound of the alarmbell scarcely ceases to strike the ear when forty thousand men in arms surrounded the convention only two hours before and petitioners threatened its members from the bar the assembly is not permanent—surely then it is completely subjugated it has done every thing that it was ordered the revolutionary power is so mighty that the convention dares not oppose it and it has no need of the convention citizens said i to some sansculottes collected round a cannon has every thing gone well—o wonderfully they embraced and sung the hymn of the marseillese there under the tree of liberty—what then is the right side appeased—faith it was    obliged to listen to reason—and what of the committee of twelve—it is kicked into the ditch—and the twentytwo—the municipality will cause them to be taken up—good but can it—is it not the sovereign it was necessary it should to set those b— of traitors right and support the commonwealth—but will the departments be well pleased to see their representatives    —what are you talking of the parisians do nothing but in concert with the departments they have said so to the convention—that is not too clear for to know their will the primary assemblies should have met—were they wanting on the  0th of august did not the departments approve what paris did then they do the same now it is paris that saves them—that ruins them rather perhaps i had crossed the court and arrived at my hackneycoach as i finished this dialogue with an old sansculotte no doubt well paid to tutor the dupes a pretty dog pressed close at my heels—is the poor creature yours said the coachman to me with a tone of sensibility very rare amongst his fellows which struck me extremely—no i know nothing of him answered i gravely as if i were speaking of a man and already thinking of something else you will set me down at the galleries of the louvre there i intended to call on a friend with whom i would consult on the means of getting roland out of paris we had not gone a dozen yards before the coach stopped what is the matter said i to the coachman—ah he has left me like a fool and i wanted to keep him for my little boy he would have been    highly pleased with him wheugh wheugh wheugh—i recollected the dog it was gratifying to me to have for a coachman at such an hour a man of a good heart of feeling and a father endeavour to catch him said i you shall put him into the coach and i will take care of him for you—the good man quite delighted caught the dog opened the door and gave him to me for a companion the poor animal appeared sensible that he had found protection and an asylum i was greatly caressed by him and i thought of that tale of sandi in which is described an old man weary of his fellow creatures and disgusted with their passions who retired to a wood in which he constructed himself a dwelling of which he sweetened the solitude by means of some animals who repaid his cares with testimonies of affection and with a species of gratitude to which he confined himself for want of meeting with its like amongst mankind pasquier had just gone to bed he rose i proposed to him my plan we agreed that he should come to me the next day after seven oclock and i would inform him where to find his friend i returned to my coach it was stopped by the sentry at the post of the woman of samaria have a little patience whispered the good coachman to me turning back on his seat it is the custom at this time of night—the serjeant came and opened the door who is here—a woman—whence do you come—from the convention—it is very true added the coachman as if he feared i should not be credited—whither are you going—home—have you no bundles—i have nothing sec—but the assembly has    broken up—yes at which i am very sorry for i had a petition to make—a woman at this hour it is very strange it is very imprudent—no doubt it is not a very common occurrence i must have had strong reasons for it—but madam alone—how sir alone do you not see i have innocence and truth with me what more is necessary—i must submit to your reasons—and you do well replied i in a gentler tone for they are good the horses were so fatigued that the coachman was obliged to pull them by the bridle to get them up the hill in the street in which i resided i got home i dismissed him and i had ascended eight or ten steps when a man close at my heels who had slipped in at the gate unperceived by the porter begged me to conduct him to citizen roland—to his apartment with all my heart if you have any thing of service to him to impart but to him is impossible—this evening he will certainly be apprehended—they must be very dexterous who accomplish it—you give me great pleasure for it is an honest citizen who accosts you—i am glad of it said i and went on without well knowing what to think of the adventure why under such circumstances did you enter into your house perhaps the reader will ask the question is by no means out of place for slander had attacked me too and malevolence might have exercised itself against me but to give a proper answer to it the state of my mind must be completely unfolded and this would require details which i reserve for a future period their results will be all i shall notice at present i have naturally an aversion    to every thing inconsistent with the grand bold and ingenuous course of innocence the exertions necessary to withdraw myself from the hand of injustice would be to me more painful than any thing it could inflict in the last two months of rolands ministry our friends often urged us to quit the hotel and did persuade us thrice to sleep from home each time against my consent an assassination was then apprehended but it was my opinion that no persons could easily be induced to violate the asylum of a man invested with a public office and if there were such wretches it appeared to me that the perpetration of such an act would be productive of beneficial consequences at all events it was incumbent on the minister to be at his post for there his death would cry aloud for vengeance and all the republic would know it whilst it was possible to reach him in his goings out or comings in with equal advantage to the perpetrator of the act and less effect for the public weal less glory for the victim such reasoning i am aware will be deemed absurd by them who prefer life to all things but he who sets any value on his life in a period of revolution will set none on virtue on honour or on his country in the month of january therefore i would on no account leave the hotel the bed of roland was in my chamber that we might both undergo the same fate and under my pillow i kept a pistol not to kill them who might come to assassinate us but to secure myself from any indignity if they offered to lay hands upon me out of place the obligation was no longer the same and i thought it right in roland to shun the fury of    the populace and the talons of his enemies to injure me could not be to them a matter of equal importance of my death they would not incur the odium and to imprison me would be to them of little service and to me no great misfortune were they possessed of sufficient sense of shame to attempt to proceed according to form and examine me i should find no difficulty in confounding them and this might serve to undeceive those who were really misled with respect to roland if they began anew a second of september the honest deputies would be also in their power and all would be lost at paris in this case i would have preferred death to living a witness of my countrys ruin and been proud of being comprised amongst the glorious victims sacrificed to the fury of guilt that fury glutted on me would be less violent against roland who if saved from this crisis might still render great services to the public in some part of france thus either i risked only imprisonment and a trial which i could turn to the advantage of my husband and of my country or if i must perish it would be under circumstances by which life would to me be rendered odious i have an amiable daughter i suckled her at my own breast i brought her up with the enthusiastic anxiety of maternal love i have set before her such examples as at her age will not be forgotten and she will be a good woman with some talents her education may be completed without my assistance her life will afford consolation to her father but she will never feel my strong affections she will never know my pains or my pleasures yet were i to be born    again and to have my own choice of dispositions i would not change my frame but would demand of the gods to make me such as i am now formed since the resignation of the minister i had lived so retired from the world that i saw scarcely any person the occupiers of one house in which i might have concealed myself were in the country in another there was a sick person which rendered the admission of a new guest too troublesome that in which roland was concealed could not accommodate me without great inconvenience besides it would have been too suspicious perhaps impolitic for me to have been in the same place with him finally it would have been painful to me to have abandoned my servants and therefore i returned home quieted their uneasiness already grown to a considerable pitch embraced my child and took up my pen to write a note which i intended to dispatch early in the morning to my husband scarcely had i sitten down when i heard a knock at my door it was about midnight a numerous deputation of the commune appeared and inquired for roland—he is not at home—but said the person who wore an officers gorget to me where can he be when will he return you know his way of life and can judge when we may expect him—i know not replied i whether your orders authorise you to put such questions to me but this i know that nothing can oblige me to answer them roland quitted his house whilst i was at the convention he could not then make me his confident and i have nothing more to say to you the troop withdrew much dissatisfied i perceived    that a sentry was left at my door and a guard at that of the house from this i inferred that i must summon strength to support whatever might happen exhausted with fatigue i ordered supper finished my letter entrusted it to my faithful nurse and retired to bed i had slept soundly about an hour when my servant entered my chamber to inform me that the officers of the section requested me to go into the adjoining apartment i understand them replied i go child they shall not wait for me long i jumped out of bed and dressed myself my nurse came in and was surprized that i should take the trouble to put on any thing more than a wrapping gown—a proper dress is necessary to go out in observed i—the poor woman looked in my face and the tears gushed into her eyes i went into the next room we come citizenness to put you under arrest and to affix seals on your property—where is your authority—here said a man taking out of his pocket a mandate from the revolutionary committee to convey me to the abbey without specifying any motive for the arrest i may tell you with roland that i know nothing of this committee that i will not obey its orders and that you shall not take me hence unless by violence—here is another order said eagerly with an air of consequence a little hard featured man and he read me one from the commune which directed also without alleging any charge the arrest of both roland and his wife whilst it was reading i debated  0 with myself whether i should carry my resistance to the utmost or quietly resign myself into their hands i might plead the law which prohibited nocturnal arrests and if the law which authorises magistrates to seize suspected persons were urged i might retort the illegality of the municipality itself cashiered and created anew by an arbitrary power but then this power the citizens of paris had in some measure sanctioned the law was become nothing more than an empty name employed for the purpose of trampling more securely on the most acknowledged rights and force prevailed to which if i compelled these brutes to have recourse they would preserve no bounds in its application resistance therefore was useless and could serve only to expose me how do you mean to proceed gentlemen—we have sent for the justice of peace of the section and you see a detachment of his armed force—the justice of peace arrived they went into my salon and fixed seals to every thing to the windows to the drawers for linen one man would have had them put on a pianoforte but he was told it was an instrument of music he then drew out a foot rule and took its dimensions as if he designed it for some particular place i asked leave to take out my daughters wardrobe and i made up a small packet of nightclothes for myself in the mean time fifty or a hundred persons were passing backwards and forwards continually filled two rooms crowded every place and might easily conceal malicious persons disposed either to remove or to put in any thing the air became loaded with noisome exhalations and i was obliged to    retire to the window of the antichamber to fetch breath the officer durst not command this crowd to withdraw occasionally he addressed to it a slight request which produced only its renewal sitting down at my bureau i wrote to a friend concerning my situation or to recommend to him my daughter as i was folding it up mr nicaud the bearer of the order from the commune said madam you must read your letter and tell us to whom it is addressed—i have no objection to read it if that will satisfy you—it is of more consequence to say to whom you address it—that i certainly shall not do the title of my friend is not of a nature at present to induce me to name to you those on whom i bestow it and i tore the letter to pieces when i turned my back they picked up the fragments to put them under seal i was tempted to laugh at their stupid eagerness for the letter had no direction in fine at seven in the morning i left my daughter and my people after having recommended to them calmness and patience by their tears i felt myself more honoured than it was in the power of oppression to render me dejected—you have people there who love you said one of the commissioners—i have never had any about me who did not replied i and i descended the stairs from the bottom of them to the coach which was on the opposite side of the street two rows of armed men were drawn up and a crowd of curious persons had assembled around i walked slowly and deliberately between them attentively viewing the cowardly or misled multitude the armed force followed the coach in two files whilst    the wretched populace deceived and massacred in the persons of its true friends stopped as i passed by attracted by the sight and some women cried out to the guillotine—shall we draw up the blinds said one of the commissioners to me very civilly—no gentlemen innocence however oppressed never puts on the guise of criminality i fear not the eye of any one and i would not conceal myself from any persons view—you have more courage than many men you submit to justice calmly—justice were justice done i should not now be in your hands but should an iniquitous procedure send me to the scaffold i would mount it with the same firmness and tranquillity with which i now go to a prison i sigh for my country i regret my mistake in supposing it qualified for liberty and happiness but life i appreciate at its due value i have never feared aught but guilt injustice and death i despise—the poor commissioners did not perfectly comprehend such language and probably thought it very aristocratic we arrived at the abbey the theatre of those bloody scenes the revival of which the jacobins have for some time preached up with such fervour the first objects that presented themselves to my sight were five or six field beds occupied by as many men in a gloomy chamber as soon as i had passed the wicket all seemed in motion and my guides made me ascend a dirty narrow staircase we came to the keeper in a sort of little salon which was tolerably clean where he offered me a couch where is my chamber said i to his wife a corpulent woman with a good countenance—madam i did not expect you i have no one    ready in the mean time you will remain here—the commissioners went into the adjoining room directed an entry of their mandate to be made and gave their verbal orders these i afterwards learnt were very rigid and often renewed afterwards but they durst not give them in writing the keeper knew his trade too well literally to pursue what he was under no obligation to follow he is an honest man active obliging and in the exercise of his office leaves nothing for justice or humanity to desire—what would you choose for breakfast—a little capillaire the commissioners withdrew observing to me that roland ought not to have absconded if he had been innocent—when a man who has rendered such important services to the cause of liberty is exposed to suspicion when a minister whose conduct has been so open and accounts so clear is become an object of detestable calumny and the bitterest persecution it would be strange if he did not withdraw himself from the last extremities of envy just as aristides severe as cato to his virtues he is indebted for his enemies their fury knows no bounds let them satiate it on me i defy its power and to it i devote myself it is incumbent on him to save himself for the sake of his country to which he may yet be capable of rendering important service—the gentlemen were a little confounded made me no answer but a bow and departed whilst i breakfasted a bedchamber was hastily put in order into which i was introduced—you may remain here madam the whole day and if i cannot get ready an apartment for you this evening as i have    a great many persons in the house a bed shall be made up in the salon—the keepers wife who said this to me added some civil observations on the regret she felt whenever a person of her own sex arrived subjoining for they have not all your serene countenance madam—i thanked her with a smile and she locked me in thus then i am in prison said i to myself i sat down and gave myself up to profound reflection the moments that followed i would not exchange for those which others would esteem the most happy of my life never will they be erased from my memory they enabled me to feel in a critical situation with a stormy precarious period in view all the value of honesty and fortitude in the sincerity of a good conscience and the strength of a courageous mind hitherto impelled by circumstances my actions in this crisis had been the result of a lively sentiment hurrying me away how grateful to find its effects justified by reason i recalled to my mind the past i weighed the events of the future and if listening to a heart of sensibility i found an affection too powerful i discovered not one that could suffuse my cheek with a blush not one but served as aliment to my courage not one but that courage could subdue i devoted myself if i may so say voluntarily to my destiny whatever it might be i defied its rigour and my mind settled itself in that disposition where it seeks nothing more than to employ the present well without anxiety about any thing farther but this tranquillity with regard to what concerned only myself i extended not to the fate of my country and of my friends with inexpressible eagerness    i listened to the cries of the street and waited for the papers of the evening however i made inquiry concerning my new situation and what portion of liberty was left me—may i write may i see any person what will be my expenses here were my first questions lavacquerie the keeper acquainted me with the directions given him and the liberty he could take with such orders i wrote to my faithful nurse to come and see me but it was agreed that she should impart to no one her having the permission the first visit i received at the abbey was from grandpré the day of my arrival—you should write to the assembly said he have you not yet set about it—no and now you mention it how shall i procure my letter to be read—i will do all i can to promote it—very well then i will write—do so i will return in a couple of hours—he left me and i wrote citizenness roland june        abbey citizenness roland to the national convention prison of the abbey june        legislators i have just been torn from my home from the arms of my daughter a girl of twelve years of age and i am detained in the abbey by virtue of orders which alleged no cause for my being apprehended these orders were issued by a revolutionary committee and some commissioners of the commune who accompanied those of the committee showed me others from the general council    which also alleged none thus i am presumed a culprit by the public i was conducted to prison with great parade in the midst of an ostentatious guard and of a misled people some of whom called loudly for the scaffold without my conductors being able to announce to any one or inform myself for what reason i was supposed a criminal and treated accordingly this is not all the bearer of the orders of the commune made no use of them except with me and to make me sign a statement of what passed when i quitted my apartment i was delivered to the commissioners of the revolutionary committee these conducted me to the abbey and on their mandate alone was i received into it an attested copy of this mandate signed by a single individual possessing no office i have subjoined every thing in my house has been sealed up whilst this was doing which continue from three oclock in the morning till seven the crowd of citizens filled my apartment and if amongst the number were present any malicious person who entertained a design of privately slipping papers calculated to throw on me the imputation of guilt into a library open in all parts he could not fail of opportunity yesterday the same committee had already sought to put under arrest the late minister whom the laws render accountable to you alone for the acts of his administration and who has been incessantly soliciting you to pass on them your judgment    roland protested against the order and the bearers of it withdrew he left his house alone to spare errour a crime whilst i had repaired to the convention to give it information of these attempts but i procured a letter to be transmitted to the president to no purpose for it was not read i went to demand justice and protection i demand them again with fresh claims for i too am now oppressed i demand of the convention to order an account of the cause and the manner of my being apprehended to be laid before it and to decide upon them if it confirm my arrest i appeal to the law which ordains the enunciation of the crime and the examination of the prisoner within twentyfour hours from the time of his caption finally i demand a report on the accounts of that irreproachable man who exhibits an instance of persecution unheard of before and who seems destined to give nations the terrible lesson of virtue proscribed by the blindness of prejudice if to have shared the strictness of his principles the energy of his courage and the ardour of his love of liberty be my crime i plead guilty and await my punishment give sentence legislators france freedom the fate of the republic and of yourselves depend necessarily this day on the distribution of that justice which it is yours to dispense the agitation in which i had passed the preceding night made me feel extreme fatigue i desired to have a chamber that same evening and i obtained one of which i took possession at ten oclock when i entered it and found myself surrounded by four    dirty walls saw a bed without curtains perceived a doublegrated window and was struck with that smell which a person accustomed to an extremely clean apartment always finds in those which are not so i was sensible that i was indeed to inhabit a prison and had no pleasure to expect from my situation it was however sufficiently roomy it had a fireplace my bedclothes were tolerable i had a pillow and estimating things in themselves without making any comparison i deemed myself not badly accommodated i went to bed fully resolved to remain in it as long as i found myself comfortable there i had not left it at ten in the morning when grandpré arrived he did not appear less affected but more uneasy than the preceding evening and his eyes surveyed the wretched room which already appeared to me tolerable for i had slept in it how have you passed the night said he to me the tears glistening in his eyes—i have been often waked by the noise but i fell asleep again as soon as it was over even in spite of the alarmbell which i think i heard this morning—ha—is it not sounding still—why i thought so—but it is not—be it as it pleases heaven if they kill me it shall be in this bed i am so weary that here i will await whatever happens is there any thing new against the deputies—no i have brought back your letter we have been thinking with champagneux that the beginning should be softened here is what we have proposed for it then you should write a line or two to the minister of the home department that he may address your letter officially which would afford me    another claim to solicit its being read—i took the paper i considered it and said to him if i thought my letter would be read as it is i would let it remain so were it to obtain no success for me for i can scarcely flatter myself with the hope of justice from the assembly the truths addressed to it are not for itself now incapable of putting them in practice but they should be said that the departments may hear them i was aware that my exordium might prevent the reading of the letter and on this account it would have been folly to have retained it the first three paragraphs therefore i omitted and substituted what was proposed to me in their stead with respect to the ministers intervention i was sensible it would render the proceeding more regular and though garat scarcely deserved the honour of being written to by me i knew how to do it without lessening myself and wrote the following lines citizenness roland to the minister of the home department the post which you fill citizen demands that you should watch over the execution of the laws and denounce their violation by authorities that abuse them i am persuaded your justice will be eager to transmit to the convention the complaints i have occasion to make against that oppression of which i am the victim rising about noon i considered how i should arrange my new apartment with a clean napkin i  0 covered a paltry little table which i placed near my window intending it to serve me for a bureau and resolving rather to eat my meals on the corner of the fireplace than on it that i might keep it clean and in order for writing two large hatpins stuck into the boards served me for a portmanteau in my pocket i had thompsons seasons a work which i valued on more than one account and i made a memorandum of what other books i wanted first was plutarchs lives of illustrious persons which at eight years of age i used to carry with me to the church instead of a prayerbook une semaine sainte and which i had not read through since and secondly humes history of england and sheridans dictionary in order to improve myself in the english language i would rather have continued to read mrs macaulay but the person who had lent me the former volumes was certainly not at home and i did not know where to procure the work as i had already sought for it in vain amongst the booksellers i could not avoid smiling myself at my preparations for there was a great tumult the drums were continually beating to arms and i knew not the occasion they will not prevent my living to my last moment said i to myself more happy in my own conscience than they will be animated with rage if they come i will advance to meet them and go to death as a man would go to repose the keepers wife came to invite me to her apartment where she had directed my cloth to be laid that i might dine in better air repairing thither i found my faithful nurse when she threw herself into my    arms bathed with tears and choked with sobs i could not avoid melting into tenderness and sorrow and almost upbraided myself for remaining tranquil whilst i reflected on the anxiety of those who were attached to me and figuring to myself the agony of this person and that i felt an indescribable oppression at my heart poor woman how many tears have i caused her to shed and for what does an attachment like hers atone in the common intercourse of life she has sometimes offended me by her bluntness but it has been when she has thought me too negligent of what might contribute to my health or happiness and when i have suffered the office of complaining has been hers that of consoling has been mine such was the case now i showed her that by giving way to her grief she would be less capable of rendering me service that she was more useful to me without than she could be within the walls of the prison where she begged me to permit her to remain and that upon the whole i was far from being so unfortunate as she imagined which was true whenever i have been ill i have experienced a particular kind of serenity unquestionably flowing from my mode of contemplating things and from the precept i have laid down for myself always to endeavour to soften necessary ills instead of revolting against them the moment i take to my bed every duty seems to me at an end and no solicitude for any thing lays hold of me i have nothing to do but remain there and remain with resignation which i do with a good grace i give free scope to my imagination i call up agreeable impressions pleasing remembrances and ideas of    happiness all exertions reasonings calculations i discard resigning myself wholly to nature and peaceful like her i suffer pain without impatience or repose myself and am cheerful i find imprisonment produces on me nearly the same effect as disease nothing farther is required of me than to remain here and what great hardship is that my own company is not so very bad i soon learnt that i must change my habitation victims were plentiful and my chamber would contain more than one bed thus that i might be alone i was obliged from that evening to be shut up in a little closet and consequently to remove my little establishment the window of my new apartment was i believe over the sentry who guarded the prisongate all the night long i heard who goes there—kill him—guard—patrole—called with a thundering voice the houses were lighted up and from the number and frequency of the patroles it was easy to infer that there had been some commotions or that tumults were feared i rose early and employed myself about my household affairs that is to say making my bed cleaning my little place and rendering it and myself as neat as i could had i desired these things to be done for me i knew they would not have been refused but i was aware that i must have paid for them dearly waited a long time and had them very superficially done at last thus by taking the office on myself i gained much i should be better and sooner served and the trifling presents i might give would be the more considered as they would be gratuitous with impatience i waited to hear the massy    bolts of my door opened that i might ask for a newspaper i read it the decree of impeachment against the twentytwo was passed the paper fell from my hands and in a transport of grief i exclaimed my country is lost whilst i imagined myself alone beneath the yoke of oppression or nearly alone proud and tranquil i formed wishes and retained some hopes for the defenders of liberty but now guilt and errour have obtained the ascendency the natural representation is violated its unity is broken and every one in it distinguished for probity united with talents and reputation is proscribed the commune of paris rules the legislative body paris is lost the torch of civil war is lighted the enemy will profit by our divisions for the north of france freedom is no more and the whole republic is delivered over to the most fearful ravages sublime illusions generous sacrifices hope happiness and country adieu at twelve years old i lamented in the first expansions of my young heart that i was not born at sparta or at rome in the french revolution i thought i saw the unexpected application of the principles with which my mind was imbued liberty said i has two sources good manners which make sage laws and knowledge which guides us to both by instructing us concerning our rights my bosom will be no longer torn by the spectacle of mankind debased the human race will improve and the happiness of all will constitute the basis and the pledge of the happiness of each splendid chimeras seducing ideas by which i have been charmed the horrible corruption of one vast city dispels    you all i have despised life your loss makes me detest it and i wish to undergo the extremes of rage anarchists savages for what wait you virtue ye have proscribed spill the blood of them who profess it shed on that earth it will render it ravenous and make it open underneath your feet the course of things ought to have made me foresee the event but i could not easily bring myself to believe that the danger to be apprehended would not check the bulk of the convention and i was astonished at the decisive act which tolled the bell of its dissolution frigid indignation now mantles all my sentiments indifferent as ever to what concerns myself my hopes for others are feeble and i await events with more curiosity than desire i no longer live to feel but to know soon i learnt that the tumult directed to force the decree of impeachment had given some uneasiness about the prisons this was the cause of the strict and noisy guard during the night the citizens of the section of unity too would not obey the beat of drum which called them to the convention but all remained at home to guard their property and the prison within their boundaries i now saw the motive of grandprés alarm and disquietude and the next day he confessed to me his apprehensions he had repaired to the assembly to obtain the reading of my letter and during eight successive hours he as well as several other deputies had repeatedly urged it to the president in vain it was evident therefore that i should not procure its being read in the monitor i observed my section    that of beaurepaire had expressed its sentiments in my favour even after my imprisonment it occurred to me therefore to write to it which i did in the following terms citizenness roland citizens the public papers inform me that you have placed roland and his wife under the safeguard of your section this i knew not when i was taken from home on the contrary the bearer of the orders of the commune represented to me the armed force with which he was accompanied as that of the section which he had demanded so he expressed it in the statement of what passed the moment i was put into the abbey i wrote to the convention and addressed myself to the minister of the homedepartment to convey to it my complaints i know that he obeyed my demand and that the letter was delivered but it was not read an attested copy of it i have the honour to transmit you if the section think it not unworthy its dignity to become the spokesman of oppressed innocence it may send a deputation to the bar of the convention to procure my just complaints and my demand to be there heard this point i submit to its wisdom i add no intreaty for truth has but one language the exposition of facts citizens who love justice are not desirous of having supplications addressed to them and innocence is unaccustomed to supplicate p s this is the fourth day of my detention and i have never yet been examined i must observe that    the order of arrest contained no charge but expressed that i should be interrogated the next day some days passed without my hearing any thing still i was not interrogated however i had received several visits from administrators with unmeaning faces and dirty ribands some of whom said they belonged to the police others to i know not what great sansculottes with matted hair strict observers of the order of the day coming to know whether the prisoners were satisfied with their treatment to them all i had expressed myself with the energy and dignity suitable to oppressed innocence i had noticed two or three men of good sense who understood me without daring to take my part and i was at dinner when five or six others were announced to me in one batch half of them came forwards he who took upon himself to speak for the rest appeared to me before he opened his lips one of those emptyheaded babblers who judge of their own merit by the volubility of their tongues—good morrow citizenness—good morrow sir—are you satisfied with this house have you no complaints to make of your treatment and no demand to make for any thing—i complain of being in this place and i demand to leave it—is your health impaired or are you a little melancholic—i am in good health and not in the least melancholic the spleen is the disease of them who have a vacuity of intellect and whose minds are destitute of resource but i have a strong sense of injustice and protest against that which has confined    me without alleging a cause and detained me without examination—o in a period of revolution there is so much to be done that there is not time for every thing—a woman to whom king philip made almost the same reply answered him if thou have not time to do me justice thou hast not time to be king take care you do not oblige oppressed citizens to say the same thing to the people or rather to the arbitrary authorities by which the people is misled—adieu citizenness—adieu—and away went my chatterer for want of knowing what to say to my reasons these people appeared to me to have come purposely to see how i should look in a cage but they would walk a great way before they would find in it dolts like themselves i have already mentioned my having inquired into the way of living in these places not that i set any great value on what people call the comforts of life which i use without scruple when no inconvenience arises from their use though always with moderation and which i can without difficulty forego but my natural disposition to orderliness prompts me to know what constitutes my expenses that i may regulate them according to my situation they informed me that roland when minister thought five livres  s  d a day for each prisoner greatly too much and reduced the sum to two  s  d but the excessive rise in the price of provision which within a few months had been tripled rendered this allowance very moderate for the nation allowing nothing but straw and the bare walls twenty sous  0d were deducted in the first instance as an    indemnification to the keeper for the bed and trifling furniture of the room the twenty sous remaining were to find candles fire if necessary and meat and drink to this however as was no more than equitable every prisoner might add what he pleased for his own expenses on myself i am not fond of spending much and i take some pleasure in exercising my strength in supporting abstinence i felt a desire of making an experiment and trying how far the human will is capable of diminishing its wants but to go any great length it is necessary to proceed by degrees at the end of four days i began with retrenching my breakfast and substituting bread and water in the room of coffee or chocolate i fixed for my dinner one plain dish of meat with some vegetable and for my supper pulse without any desert to break myself from wine i drank beer at first and then i left off this as this regimen however had a moral purpose and as i have as much aversion as contempt for useless economy i gave a certain sum to those unfortunate prisoners who had nothing that when i ate my dry bread in a morning i might have the satisfaction to reflect the poor creatures would be indebted to me for being able to add something to theirs at dinner if i remain here six months i would quit the place with a healthy complexion and a body by no means emaciated having reduced my wants so as to be satisfied with soup and bread and having gained some blessings unknown i made some presents also but with another intention to the servants of the prison when a person is or appears to be rigidly economical in point of expense he must    be generous to others if he would not be blamed for it particularly when from his expenses accrue the profits of those about him i require no one to wait upon me i send for nothing i have nothing bought i employ no person consequently i should be the worst of prisoners with the domestics who make their little profits on what they are commissioned to provide or procure it is fitting therefore that i should purchase the state of independance in which i place myself thus i render it more perfect and make myself also beloved i received a few visits from the excellent champagneux and the worthy bosc the former father of a numerous family was attached to liberty from principle and had professed its sound doctrines from the commencement of the revolution in a newspaper which he intended for the information of his fellowcitizens he was distinguished by a sound judgment gentle manners and an aversion to idleness roland when minister placed him at the head of the first division of the home department it was one of the best choices he made though he was not less successful in the selection of many other principals as the active and ingenuous camus the able fépoul and some others never were offices better filled and nothing but the perfection of their establishments could enable garat to support a burden to which he is unequal to the honesty and capacity of such agents he is indebted for the tranquillity he is allowed to enjoy of this he is sensible and he said with good reason that he would quit the party if he were obliged to make any change in his offices notwithstanding  0 this he will be forced to quit his post for no talents in assistants can compensate for a ministers want of firmness irresolution is the worst of faults in those who govern particularly in the midst of factions garat and barrière as private individuals would not be deemed deficient in sense or honesty but the one charged with the executive power and the other a legislator would ruin all the states in the world by their halfmeasures their fury for pursuing what they term conciliatory plans propels them in that oblique path which leads directly to the precipice of confusion statesmen should be conciliating only in mode i mean in their manner of behaving to those with whom they are connected they should avail themselves of the very passions and faults of those whom they direct or with whom they treat but rigid in their principles firm and rapid in action no obstacle no consideration should make them bend in the former respect or alter their course in the latter could roland unite with his extensive views strength of mind and prodigious activity a little more artfulness of manner he would easily rule an empire but his faults are prejudicial to himself alone his good qualities are of infinite value to an administration bosc an old friend of an ingenuous disposition and enlightened mind came to me the first day of my imprisonment and was instant to conduct my daughter to madame creuzélatouche who receives her kindly as one of her own children with whom it was resolved she should remain under her own eyes to be sensible of all the value of this step it is necessary to know the persons it is necessary to figure the    feeling and openhearted bosc running to his friends taking their child intrusting her of his own accord to the most respectable family as a pledge which he felt himself honoured in confiding to their hands and which he knew would be received with the pleasure experienced by delicate minds when an opportunity of doing good is offered them and it is necessary to have been acquainted with the patriarchal manners and the domestic virtues of creuzé and his wife and the gentleness and goodness of their characters to form a due estimate of the worth of this reception who then is to be pitied in all this roland alone roland persecuted proscribed roland the examination of whose accounts has been refused roland compelled to conceal himself as a criminal to avoid the blind fury of men misled by his enemies to tremble even for the safety of those who shelter him to swallow in silence the imprisonment of his wife and the sealing up every thing belonging to him—and to await in a state of incertitude the reign of justice which can never indemnify him for all that perversity has made him suffer my section imbibed with the best principles passed on the third a decree which breathed them and which established the right of citizens to protest against arbitrary imprisonment and even resist such as might be attempted my letter was read there and listened to with concern the debate that took place on it being prolonged to the next day the mountaineers concerted together the alarm was given to their party a number of deputations of the violent of the other sections arrived to fetter the progress of the deliberations and if possible corrupt the    temper of this or frighten it by threats and induce a majority of the sections to disarm it whilst these things was going on urged by grandpré to neglect no means of shortening the term of my captivity i wrote again to garat and also to gohier the latter whom i have scarcely ever seen possessed not more firmness than garat and has appeared to me inferiour to him in every other respect i could not easily write to such men without giving them lessons and they were severe grandpré thought them mortifying though just i softened some of the expressions and dispatched what follows citizenness roland june        abbey citizenness roland to the minister of justice prison of the abbey june        i am suffering oppression i am entitled therefore to remind you of my rights and your duties an arbitrary order without specifying any charge has plunged me into a place prepared for culprits in it i have resided a week without being examined the laws are known to you they direct you to visit the prisons and to set at liberty them who are detained without cause lately too a decree has been passed which enjoins you to take care that the orders for arrests are shown to you to examine whether they allege any charge and to cause the persons who are imprisoned to be interrogated i transmit to you an attested copy of that by virtue of which i have been forced from my home and brought hither i demand the execution of the law on my own account    and on yours innocent and firm injustice reaches without debasing me and i can submit to it with pride at a time when virtue is proscribed of your will placed as you are between the law and dishonour there can be no doubt and you are to be pitied if you have not courage to act according to it citizenness roland june        to the minister of the home department june        i know you have transmitted my complaints to the legislative body but my letter has not been read have you fulfilled the whole of your duties by forwarding it at my request—i have been apprehended without any cause being alleged i have been detained a week without having been interrogated it behoves you filling a public post to endeavour the delivery of that innocence which you could not preserve from oppression you are more interested perhaps than myself in the office i invite you to undertake i am not the sole victim of prejudice and envy and their present pursuit of every one who unites virtue with talents renders honourable the persecution of which i am the object and which is owing to my connexion with the venerable man whose cause posterity will revenge but you who are now at the helm if you be incapable of guiding it with a firm hand will not escape the reproach of having yielded the vessel to the waves    and the disgrace of having remained at a post the functions of which you could not execute factions pass away justice alone remains and of all the faults of men in place weakness is the least pardoned for it is the source of the greatest disorders particularly in troublous times i need not add any thing to these reflections if they reach you in time for you and for myself or urge their application to what concerns me since nothing can supply the want of courage and of will ministers who have neglected and despised the decrees that enjoined them to seek out the authors of the massacre of september and the conspirators of the  0th of march men whose weak and unworthy conduct on those occasions emboldened guilt favoured criminality and assured this new insurrection in which blindness and audacity prescribing laws to the national convention call forth all the evils of civil war will not be the impeachers of oppression from them i expect nothing the truths i address to them are calculated much more to show them what they ought and what they have failed to do than to procure me that justice which they are incapable of rendering unless a little shame produce a miracle esop represents all the animals who usually trembled at the aspect of the lion coming to insult him when ill each in his turn thus the mob of inferiour men deceived or jealous attack with fury them whom oppression holds captive or whose capabilities it diminishes by changing the public opinion respecting them of this the thermometer of the day    for the  th of june no     affords an example there appears under the title of examination of l p dorleans a series of questions amongst which the following accusation is to be noticed that he had been present at secret cabals held by night at the apartment of the wife of buzot in the suburb of st germain at which were present dumouriez roland and his wife vergniaux brissot gensonné gorsas louvet petion cuadet c what profundity of wickedness and what excess of impudence the deputies here named are precisely those who voted for the banishment of the bourbons those proud defenders of freedom never considered dorleans as a leader possessed of capacity but he always appeared to them a dangerous implement they were the first to dread his vices his wealth his connexions his popularity and his faction and to denounce the latter and pursue them whom they deemed its agents louvet has marked them out in his philippic against robespierre a valuable piece as are all that have come from his pen which history will carefully preserve in which he follows them step by step to the electoral assembly whence dorleans issued a deputy buzot whose persevering energy has drawn on him the hatred of the factions seized the first instant he thought favourable to demand the banishment of the bourbons a measure which he regarded as indispensable from the moment the convention took upon itself to pass judgment on lewis neither roland nor i ever visited dorleans even sillery who i am told is a good and amiable man i have avoided admitting to my house    because his connexion with dorleans rendered me suspicious of him i remember two striking letters on this subject one of which was written by madame sillery to louvet after he had supported the motion of buzot see here a proof said louvet showing it to me that we are not mistaken and that the orleans party is no chimera madame sillery would not write to me in such terms were she not in concert with the parties concerned and if they be so much afraid of banishment it must be because exile will defeat some of their schemes in fact the object of the studied letter of madame sillery was to induce louvet to change his opinion she endeavouring to persuade him that the republican principles in which the children of dorleans had been educated would render them the most zealous supporters of a commonwealth and that it was equally cruel and impolitic to sacrifice unquestionably useful subjects to absurd prejudices the other letter was louvets answer which exhibited his motives for his opinion with force yet delivered them with politeness in it he observed that the monarchical principles and aristrocatical and other prejudices which appeared in the works of madame sillery herself were far from satisfying him with respect to those of her pupils and with the dignity of a free man he persisted in an opinion which the love of his country inspired with respect to the pretended cabals at buzots wifes nothing in the world could be so ridiculous buzot who visited us frequently at the time of the constituent assembly with whom i remained in friendly    intercourse and whose courage sensibility purity of principles and gentleness of manners inspired me with infinite esteem and attachment came frequently to the residence of the minister of the homedepartment his wife i visited only once after their arrival at paris when he was sent up to the convention and they had no kind of connexion with dumouriez indignant at these absurdities i took up my pen to write to dulaure the editor of the thermometer of the day a worthy man who had visited me till he was seduced by the mountain citizenness roland june        abbey dulaure citizenness roland to the deputy dulaure author of the thermometer of the day prison of the abbey june        if any thing could add to the astonishment of innocence when it finds itself underneath the yoke of oppression i would tell you citizen that i had just read with the greatest surprise the absurdities delivered in your paper of this day under the title of interrogation of philip dorleans which chance has thrown into my hands it would seem very strange had not experience proved it to be only very audacious that those persons who first feared announced and pursued an orleans faction should be represented as having formed it themselves time will unquestionably clear up this mystery of iniquity but whilst its justice may be tardy in the midst of such fearful corruption it appears to me incumbent    on yours when publishing the questions of an interrogatory calculated to disseminate suspicions to annex the answers which must have been made and which may enable an estimate of them to be formed this justice is the more strictly requisite as calumny and persecution follow the steps of the persons named in these questions and as most of them are in the toils of a decree snatched by audacity and prejudice from the hands of weakness and errour i myself have been in prison a week in virtue of a mandate which alleges no charge i have never been examined i have not been able to obtain a hearing of my complaints from the convention and when it was announced to it that they had been suppressed it passed to the order of the day under pretence that they concerned it not what then new authorities act arbitrarily the constituted authorities bow before them and ought not the injustices they commit to be laid before the convention is it not to the legislative body that complaints should be addressed when there remains none other to hear them it can interest itself for them who are confined by order of the tribunal of marseilles whilst i am confined here by a revolutionary committee and my rights are no more—and the commune makes the newspapers repeat that the prisons of paris contain only assassins thieves and counterrevolutionists—citizen i have known you i believe you honest how will you grieve at some future day—i transmit to you some notes which i request you to peruse and i recommend to you to insert in your paper that letter which i could not prevail    on the convention to read that you owe me this justice circumstances sufficiently demonstrate on which if it be possible for you not to perceive this it would be useless for me to say more p s neither roland nor i ever visited philip dorleans and i ought to add that i have always heard the deputies mentioned in the interrogatory as quoted in the thermometer of this day profess for him the same contempt as i have always felt and if ever we have talked about him our conversation has turned on the fears which the true friends of liberty must experience on his account and the necessity of banishing him for that reason as circumstances have led me to mention dumouriez i will say what i know of him and what i think but this carries me back to the first ministry of roland and incites me to relate here how this austere man came to be nominated to a place which kings seldom call a man like him to fill i shall take up the thread of my narrative from a period somewhat remote and the leisure of my captivity enables me to record facts and recollect circumstances which but for it perhaps i should never have written roland executed the office of inspector of commerce and manufactures in the generality of lyons with such knowledge of the subject and such administrative views as must have distinguished him from the bulk of inspectors had the government known how to keep up the spirit of the institution of which roland was almost the only one who afforded an example superiour to his place in every respect fond  0 of employment and sensible to fame he arranged in the silence of his closet the materials which his experience and activity had enabled him to collect and he continued the dictionary of manufactures for the new encyclopedia brissot presented some of his works to roland as a testimony of the esteem with which the principles of justice and liberty he observed in his writings had inspired him these were received with the sensibility natural to authors and that of a worthy man who receives the commendations of others like himself and gave birth to a correspondence at first not very frequent afterwards supported by that of one of our friends who became acquainted with brissot at paris and spoke of him with much praise us applying to practice the philosophical and moral theory of his works and ultimately cherished by the revolution of      for events daily multiplying strongly exercised the minds of philosophers prepared for liberty and produced interesting communications between those who were enflamed with the love of their fellowcreatures and the hope of seeing the reign of justice and happiness over all arrive brissot having at this juncture begun a periodical work the excellence of the reasoning in which will make it often consulted we sent to him every thing of which circumstances induced us to suppose the publication useful this speedily improved our acquaintance and we became intimate and confidential friends before we had seen each other amidst those crises inevitable in a period of revolution when principles prejudices and passions raise insurmountable obstacles between persons who before    well agreed roland was chosen into the municipality of lyons his situation in life his family and his connexions were such as might be supposed to attach him to the aristocracy whilst his character and disposition rendered him interesting to the popular party to which his philosophy and austerity much inclined him no sooner had he taken a decided part than he found enemies so much the more violent as his inflexible integrity proclaimed without reserve all the abuses which had multiplied in the administration of the finances of the town this in fact exhibited an epitome of the dilapidations of those of the state and lyons had its debt of forty millions £         it was necessary to solicit assistance for the manufactures had suffered and twenty thousand workmen had been without bread during the winter to impart the situation of lyons to the constituent assembly it was resolved to send a deputy extraordinary and roland was chosen we arrived at paris the  0th of february      after i had been absent from the place of my nativity five years i had followed the progress of the revolution and the labours of the assembly and had studied the characters and talents of its leading members with an interest not easy to be conceived and scarcely to be appreciated except by them who knew my activity and turn of mind i ran to the sittings i saw the powerful mirabeau    the astonishing cazales the daring maury the artful lameths the frigid barnave i remarked with vexation that kind of superiority on the side of the blacks which the habit of representation purity of language and distinguished manners give in large assemblies but the strength of reason the courage of integrity the lights of philosophy the knowledge of office and the fluency of the bar must secure the triumphs of the patriots of the left if they were all honest and could remain in unison brissot came to visit us i know nothing so pleasant as the first interview between persons who are connected by correspondence without knowing each others faces with mutual curiosity they examine each other to see whether the physiognomy accord with the features of the mind and the exteriour appearance confirm the opinion entertained of the person the simple manners natural negligence and ingenuous frankness of brissot appeared to me in perfect harmony with the austerity of his principles but i found in him a sort of levity of mind and disposition which was not equally suitable to the gravity of a philosopher this always gave me pain and of this his enemies always took advantage in proportion as i became more acquainted with him i esteemed    him more it is not in human nature to combine more complete disinterestedness with greater zeal for the public welfare or to pursue the general good with more entire forgetfulness of self but his writings are better fitted than his person to effectuate it for they carry all the authority which reason justice and intelligence can impress whilst personally he can assume none for want of dignity he is the best of men a good husband an affectionate father a faithful friend a virtuous citizen in society as gentle as his temper is easy confiding to imprudence gay simple and ingenuous as at fifteen he was framed to live with the wise and to be the dupe of the wicked learned in the science of law inclined from his youth to study the relations of society and the means of human happiness he has formed a sound judgment of man yet is totally unacquainted with men he knows that vices exist but he cannot believe any one vicious who speaks to him with an open countenance and when he has discovered a person to be so he treats him as an idiot who is to be pitied without mistrusting him of hatred he is incapable you would say his mind with all its sensibility possesses not sufficient firmness for a sentiment of such energy extensive in his knowledge he writes with extreme facility and composes a treatise as another would copy a song hence the discriminating eye detects in his works the hasty touch of a quick and often light mind though the matter is excellent his activity and goodnature rejecting nothing he imagines to be of utility have given him an appearance of meddling with every thing and have led them to accuse him of intrigue    who wanted to accuse him of something it is laughable to call such a man an intriguer who never thinks of himself or those belonging to him who is equally incapable and averse to study his own private interest and who is no more ashamed of poverty than he is afraid of death thinking both the one and the other the usual rewards of public virtue i have seen him dedicating his whole time to the revolution for no other end than to forward the triumph of truth and promote the general warfare and whilst assiduously occupied in the publication of his paper of which he might easily have made considerable profit contenting himself with the moderate emolument allowed him by his partner his wife humble as himself a woman of good sense and some strength of mind judged more severely of things ever since their marriage her views had been turned towards the united states of america as the abode most suitable to their tastes and manners and where they might easily settle with a very moderate fortune brissot had made a voyage thither in consequence and they were on the point of embarking for that shore when the revolution chained him here born at chartres and the comrade of pétion who was a native of the fame town brissot connected himself still more intimately with him in the constituent assembly where his labours and intelligence were often of assistance to his friend he brought us acquainted with him as well as with several other deputies whom former acquaintance or merely similitude of principles and zeal for the public good induced often to meet together to converse on the common cause it was even fixed that they    should come to my house four evenings in the week because i was sedentary and well accommodated and my apartment was so situated as to be at no great distance from any of them who composed these little committees this arrangement suited me perfectly it made me acquainted with the progress of affairs in which i was strongly interested and it favoured my taste for pursuing political speculations and studying men i knew what part became one of my sex and i never stepped out of it the conversations took place in my presence without my mixing in them sitting at a table without the circle i employed my fingers in working or writing letters whilst the company debated yet if i dispatched ten epistles which sometimes was the case i lost not a single word of what passed and more than once bit my lips to keep in my own opinion what struck me most and gave me singular pain was that sort of chat and frivolity in which men of sense passed three or four hours without coming to any conclusion to take things in detail you would have heard excellent principles maintained good ideas started and some views opened but taking the whole together there was no path traced no fixed aim no determinate point towards which each was to proceed in his way sometimes for very vexation i could have boxed the ears of these philosophers whom i daily learnt to esteem for the honesty of their hearts and the purity of their intentions excellent reasoners all learned politicians in theory but totally ignorant of the art of    leading men and consequently of swaying an assembly their wit and learning were commonly lavished to no end yet i have known some good decrees thus planned which have afterwards passed soon the coalition of the minority of the nobility completely weakened the left side and produced the evils of a revisal there remained only a small number of inflexible men who durst contend for principles and these at length were reduced to few more than buzot pétion and robespierre at that time robespierre had to me the semblance of an honest man and for the sake of his principles i forgave the defects of his language and his tiresome manner of speaking i noted however that he was always reserved in these committees he heard the opinions of all seldom gave his own or did not take the trouble to deliver his reasons and i have been told that the next day the first to mount the tribune he flourished away with the arguments that had dropped in the evening from his friends for this conduct he was sometimes gently reproved when he passed it off with a jest and it was forgiven him as the wile of that devouring selflove with which he was really tormented this could not do otherwise than diminish in some degree mutual confidence for if something were to be proposed and it was necessary to agree on what was to be done or to distribute the several parts in consequence there could never be any certainty that robespierre would not come as it were in a freak and throw himself athwart the business or inconsiderately bring forward the attempt before it was    ripe from a desire of ascribing to himself the honour of it and thus frustrate the design persuaded that robespierre was passionately enamoured of liberty i was inclined to attribute his faults to an excess of fiery zeal that kind of reserve which seems to indicate a mans fear of suffering himself to be seen through because he is conscious it would not be to his advantage to be known or the distrust of one who finds in himself no reason to credit virtue in another and which distinguishes robespierre gave me pain but i mistook it for bashfulness thus with a lucky prejudice in favour of a person we transform the most untoward indications into symptoms of the most amiable qualities never did the smile of confidence rest on the lips of robespierre whilst they are almost always contracted by the sour grin of envy aiming to appear disdain his talents as an orator were below mediocrity his mean voice ill chosen expressions and faulty pronunciation rendered his discourse very tiresome but he maintained principles with warmth and perseverance and there was some courage in continuing to do this at a time when the defenders of the cause of the people were infinitely diminished in number the court detested and calumniated them to support and encourage them therefore was the duty of the patriots i esteemed robespierre on this account and i told him so and when he was not a very constant attendant at the little committee he occasionally came to dine with me i had been struck with the terrour he discovered the day of the kings flight to varennes that afternoon i met him at pétions where he said with alarm that the royal family    would not having taken such a step without having a coalition in paris to direct a massacre of the patriots and that he expected not to live four and twenty hours pétion and brissot on the contrary said that this flight would be the kings ruin and that advantage must be taken of it that the people were excellently disposed and would be more clearly convinced of the treachery of the court by this step than they would have been by the ablest publications that this single fact rendered it evident to all that the king would not maintain the constitution to which he had sworn and that this was the time to secure one less heterogenous and in order to it prepare mens minds for a republic robespierre with his usual sneer and biting his nails asked what was a republic the plan of a paper entitled the republican of which two numbers only were published was now formed dumont of geneva a sensible man was the editor du châtelet an officer in the army lent his name and condorcet brissot and others prepared to assist in it the seizure of lewis xvi gave robespierre great pleasure for in it he saw the prevention of mischief and ceased to fear for himself the others were grieved at it they perceiving the return of a post into the go vernment that intriguing would revive and that the effervescence of the people allayed by the pleasure of seeing the culprit detained would no longer second the efforts of the friends of freedom they judged rightly and the more surely because the reconciliation of lafayette with the lameths proved to them the existence of a new coalition which could not have the public good for its foundation it was not possible to    counterbalance it unless by the force of the general opinion displayed in a powerful manner for which the patriots had only their pens and their voices but when some popular commotion came to their aid they availed themselves of it with pleasure without inquiring how it was produced or giving themselves much concern about it there was behind the curtain an interested person whom the aristocrats accused with such vehemence that the patriots were tempted to pardon him so long as they perceived nothing but what might be turned to the common good besides they could not persuade themselves that he was any way formidable it is not easy to command our passions in the time of a revolution there is indeed no instance of one accomplished without them great obstacles are to be overcome and this cannot be affected without an ardour and a devotion to the cause which must either proceed from enthusiasm or produce it when this is the case we seize with avidity what may serve our purpose and lose the faculty of perceiving what may prove injurious hence that confidence that eagerness to profit by a sudden movement without tracing it to its origin to know justly how to direct it hence that indelicacy if i may so say in the concurrence of agents whom we do not esteem but whom we permit to act because they appear to promote the same end dorleans standing singly was surely not to be feared but his name his relationships his wealth and his advisers gave him great means he acted unquestionably a secret part in all the popular commotions men of pure intentions suspected it but these ferments they deemed necessary to raise the inert mass they contented themselves  0 with taking no share in them and flattered themselves that they should turn all to the benefit of the public besides they were more inclined to attribute to dorleans the desire of revenging himself on a court which had despised him and which he would be wellpleased to humble than the design of his own elevation the jacobins proposed a petition to the assembly to demand of it to pass judgment on the traitor who had fled or to request it to take the sense of the people on the punishment which he might deserve and in the mean time to declare that he had lost the confidence of those of paris laclos a man of great parts whom nature had formed for comprehensive views and whose vices had dedicated all his faculties to intrigue laclos devoted to dorleans and of great weight in his council made this proposal to the jacobins who received it and with whom it was abetted by some hundreds of tumultuaries and streetwalkers who tumbled from the palaisroyal into the place of their meeting at ten oclock at night i saw them arrive the society deliberated with that mob who also voted it decreed the substance of the petition and it appointed a committee to draw it up in which were laclos and brissot they were employed on it that very night for it had been resolved that a deputation of the society should carry it to the champdemars the next day there to be shown to all who might wish to examine and sign it laclos pretended a headach arising from want of sleep which would not suffer him to hold the pen and requested brissot to take it and conversing with him on the composition he proposed    for the last article i know not what clause which revived royalty and opened a door for dorleans brissot surprised rejected it with eagerness and the other an able politician gave it up with the pretence of not having sufficiently weighed its consequences well knowing that he could still slide it in and in fact it did appear in the printed paper disseminated abroad as the resolution of the jacobins but when the society assembled the next morning to examine the petition drawn up and send it away was informed that the national assembly had decided on the question of the king it dispatched a committee to the champdemars to announce to the people that the decree respecting the king having passed the proposed petition could no longer take place i was at the champdelafederation led thither by curiosity there were not more than two or three hundred persons dispersed about the environs of the altar of the country from which deputies of the cordeliers of the fraternal societies bearing pikes with inflammatory inscriptions harangued the bystanders and animated their indignation against lewis xvi it was said the jacobins having suppressed their petition it was requisite that the zealous citizens should frame another and assemble the next day for that purpose at this juncture the partisans of the court feeling the necessity of striking terrour into these combined together the means of making a grand stroke the trains were laid in consequence and the unexpected proclamation of martial law and its prompt execution produced what    has been justly called the massacre of the champdemars the terrified people durst not stir part of the national guard seduced or deceived seconding lafayette from obsequiousness to the court or blind confidence in his pretended patriotism served as a rampart against its fellowcitizens the standard of death was displayed from the townhall and the whole of the revision was made under its influence the establishment of the feuillans had been planned much about the same time to weaken the jacobins and certainly the whole proceedings of the coalition at that period evinced how much the court and its partisans were superiour to their adversaries in weaving a tissue of intrigues i never knew affright comparable to that of robespierre under these circumstances there was indeed a talk of putting him on his trial meant probably to intimidate him and it was said that there was a plot hatching at the feuillans against him and the committee who drew up the petition at the jacobins roland and i were really uneasy on his account we drove to his house at the farther end of the marsh at eleven at night to offer him an asylum but he had already quitted his habitation thence we proceeded to buzot to tell him that perhaps he would do well without leaving the society of the jacobins to enter into that of the feuillans to see what passed and to be ready to defend any whom they might intend to persecute buzot hesitated some time at length he said speaking of robespierre i would do any thing to save that unhappy young man though i am far from entertaining the same opinion of him as some    others he thinks too much of himself to be greatly in love with liberty but he serves its cause and that is enough for me yet the public must take place of him i should be inconsistent in my principles and give a false idea of them if i went to the feuillans i have too much repugnance to a part that would give me two faces grégoire is gone thither he will let us know what passes and nothing can be done against robespierre without the agency of the assembly where i shall always be ready to defend him for my part i have seldom gone to the jacobins of late because the set grieves me and appears more hideous in its noisy assemblies but i shall be assiduous in my attendance there as long as the voice of persecution is raised against a society which i believe to be useful to the cause of freedom these words paint the mind of buzot he acts as he speaks with truth and rectitude his character is probity itself arrayed in the pleasing garb of sensibility i had distinguished him in our little committee by the soundness of his advice and that decided manner which characterises a man of integrity he lived not far from us he had a wife an affable woman but not on a par with him and we visited frequently when the success of rolands mission with respect to the debt of the commune of lyons allowed us to return to beaujolois we kept up a correspondence with buzot and robespierre that with the former was the more regular between us there was greater similarity a wider foundation for friendship and an abundance of materials to support it it became intimate and unalterable elsewhere i shall say how this connection was drawn closer    the mission of roland detained him seven months at paris we quitted that city in the middle of september after he had obtained for lyons all it could desire and we spent the autumn in the country employed in the vintage one of the last acts of the constituent assembly was the suppression of inspectors we considered whether we should determine to remain in the country or rather spend the winter in paris there to prefer the claim of roland to a pension after having been forty years in office and at the same time pursue his labours for the encyclopedia more easy in the focus of science amidst artists and men of letters than in the depth of a desert we returned to paris in the month of december the members of the constituent assembly had returned to their several homes pétion had been appointed to the mayoralty and was wholly occupied with the cares of that office there was no particular object to rally around and we saw brissot himself much less frequently the whole of our attention centred at home rolands industry led him to project the scheme of a journal of useful arts and we sought in the pleasures of study to withdraw our minds from public affairs the state of which appeared to us distressing many deputies of the legislative assembly however met sometimes at the house of one of them in vendome square and roland whose patriotism and knowledge were esteemed was invited to make one of the party but the distance he disliked and seldom went one of our friends who was there frequently informed us about the middle of march that    the intimidated court sought in its embarrassment to do something to give it popularity that it would have no aversion to form a jacobin ministry and that the patriots were busied in endeavouring to make the choice fall on men of steadiness and ability which was of the more importance because it might only be a snare on the part of the court which would not be sorry to have wrongheaded persons forced upon it who might become just objects of complaint or scorn he added that some had thought of roland whose character in the learned world ministerial knowledge and public reputation for justice and firmness promised stability roland at that time went pretty frequently to the jacobin society and was one of its committee of correspondence the idea appeared to me visionary and made little impression on my mind the   st of the same month brissot came to me in the evening and repeated the same observations upon a more positive manner asking whether roland would consent to take such a burden on his shoulders i replied that having mentioned the subject to him in the course of conversation when it was first started he had weighed its difficulties and dangers which his zeal and activity were not then disposed to reject but it would be necessary to examine the business more closely the courage of roland did not shrink his knowledge of his own strength inspired him with a confidence of being serviceable to the cause of freedom and his country and this answer was given to brissot the next day friday the   d at eleven in the evening he came to our house with dumouriez who having just left    the council proceeded to inform roland of his being appointed minister of the homedepartment and salute him as his colleague they remained a quarter of an hour and a time was named for roland to be sworn in the next day that man said i to my husband after their departure speaking of dumouriez whom i then saw for the first time has a subtle mind and a deceitful look perhaps he is more to be distrusted than any person in the world he has expressed great pleasure at the patriotic choice he was employed to announce yet i shall not be surprised if some future day he procure your dismission—indeed that single view of dumouriez exhibited him to me so very different from roland that i could not suppose it possible they should long remain connected together on the one side i beheld integrity and frankness personified and rigid justice devoid of all the qualifications of a courtier and of the caution of a man of the world on the other i fancied i discovered a libertine of great parts a hardy chevalier who would make a jest of any thing except his own interest and fame it was not difficult to infer that such elements would repel each other the incredible industry of roland his readiness in business and his great propensity to method soon enabled him when minister to arrange in his head all the branches of his department but the principles and habits of the chief clerks rendered his employment extremely laborious it was necessary for him to be continually on his guard and extremely attentive to let nothing contradictory pass and he had perpetually to contend with his agents he strongly    felt the necessity of changing them but he was too prudent to do this before he had become familiar with affairs and secured persons to supply their places with respect to the council its sittings resembled rather the conversations of a private company than the deliberations of statesmen each minister carried to it orders and proclamations to be signed and the minister of justice presented decrees to be sanctioned the king read the gazette put questions to each respecting his own concerns thus artfully displaying that kind of interest respecting them all of which the great know how to make a merit talked like a good sort of man about affairs in general and at every turn professed with an air of frankness his desire to maintain the constitution i have seen roland and claviere almost enchanted for three weeks with the kings disposition crediting him on his own word and rejoicing like honesthearted men at the turn things must take good god said i to them when i see you set out for the council in this unsuspecting disposition you always seem to me on the brink of committing some folly—i could never put faith in the constitutional vocation of a king born and brought up to despotism and accustomed to exercise it lewis xvi must have been a man far beyond the common race of mortals to be sincerely the friend of a constitution that restrained his power and had he been such a man he would never have permitted the arrival of those events which brought on the constitution the first time roland appeared at court the plainness of his apparel his round hat and shoes tied with    ribbands astonished and offended all the valets those beings who their existence depending solely on etiquette believe the safety of the state depends on its preservation the master of the ceremonies approaching dumouriez with an alarmed countenance and contracted brow whispered him glancing a look at roland from the corner of his eye why sir he has no buckles in his shoes—ah sir all is lost answered dumouriez with a gravity fit to make any one burst with laughter a council was held four times a week the ministers having agreed to dine together in turn on these days on friday they met at my table degrave was then minister at war he was a little man in every sense of the word nature had formed him gentle and timid his prejudices prompted him to be lofty his heart inspired him with the desire of being amiable and endeavouring to reconcile these he became in reality nothing methinks i see him walking with the gait of a courtier his head erect on his slight body displaying the whites of his blue eyes which he cannot keep open after dinner without the aid of two or three cups of coffee speaking little as through reserve but in reality for want of ideas and at length so bewildering himself in the affairs of his department as to ask leave to retire lacoste a true clerk in office of the ancient order of which he had the insignificant and awkward look frigid air and dogmatic tone wanted none of those advantages which arise from being hackneyed in business but his close exteriour concealed a violence of temper the excesses of which when he was contradicted were ridiculous and he    had neither the activity nor extensive views necessary for a minister duranthon who had been called from bourdeaux to be made minister of justice was an honest man they say but very indolent his air was vain and his timid disposition and pompous tattle made him always appear to me an old woman clavière reputed able in finance before he was minister has skill in that subject i believe of which i am no judge active and industrious naturally irascible obstinate as most men are who live much in the retirement of the closet cavilling and stiff in debate could not avoid clashing with roland dry and peremptory in dispute and not less attached to his opinions these two men were formed to esteem without ever loving each other and they did not belie their destiny dumouriez had of what is called parts more than all and of morality less than any one of them diligent and brave a good general an able courtier writing well delivering himself with fluency and capable of great undertakings he wanted only more consistency of mind or a cooler head to follow the plan he had conceived pleasant with his friends and ready to deceive them all gallant with women but by no means calculated to succeed with those whom a tender intercourse might seduce he was formed for ministerial intrigue and a corrupt court his brilliant qualities and the interest of his fame gave room for a persuasion that he might be employed with advantage in the army of the republic and perhaps he would have proceeded in the right path if the convention had been prudent for he is  0 too able not to act like an honest man when it would promote his interest and reputation degrave was succeeded by servan an honest man in the fullest signification of the term of an ardent temper and pure manners with all the austerity of a philosopher and the benevolence of a feeling heart an enlightened patriot a brave soldier a vigilant minister he needed only more coolness of mind and more strength of character the troubles on the score of religion and the dispositions of foreign enemies calling for decisive decrees the refusal of sanctioning them completely stripped off the veil from louis xvi whose good faith was already strongly suspected by those of his ministers who had been induced to believe it real at first the refusal was not positive the king would consider the subject he put off the sanction till the following council and always found reasons still to defer it these procrastinations gave the ministers room to declare their sentiments boldly roland and servan in particular insisted without ceasing and uttered the most striking truths with great energy their situation became critical the commonwealth was in danger it was requisite that the really patriotic ministers should obtain what was necessary to save it or retire that they might not be assisting in its ruin roland proposed to his colleagues a letter to the king to this effect claviere cavilled at its expressions duranthon who liked his place was unwilling to risk its loss if he could retain it without being a traitor confest lacoste did not approve of strong measures and the will of the king appeared to him at    bottom the best of all rules dumouriez left them to debate and attended to his own cards he meditated revenge for what he considered as a trick the fact was as follows a certain rumour which is not indeed the opinion of the public but which precedes and indicates it prevailed against bonnecarrere whom dumouriez had made directorgeneral of the department of foreign affairs he had the reputation of an intriguer and possessed the talents disposition and manners of one at least so i have heard men of probity say who related some circumstances of his life and lamented the choice dumouriez had made the report was spread of some place being bestowed or affair settled by bonnecarrere at the price of a hundred thousand livres £     part of which was to be given to madam de beauvert the mistress of dumouriez who lived in his house and presided at his table to the great displeasure of men of sense who were friends to morals and to liberty for this licentiousness in a servant of the public charged with affairs of state too strongly showed a contempt of decorum and madam de beauvert sister of rivarol well known to his discredit was surrounded with imps of the aristocracy little to be commended on any account had not the conduct of dumouriez been blamable on principle it was impolitic and calculated to excite suspicion i was frequently visited by brissot and several other members of the legislative assembly at my house they frequently met the ministers and kept up that kind of intimacy with them which is requisite amongst    men who devoted to the cause of the public have need of understanding and informing one another to serve it the more effectually the story of bonnecarrere was related to one of them the person told the names of the parties concerned and the notary in whose hands the money was deposited or who was appointed to receive it the particulars have escaped my memory i only recollect that two men of character came to my house to aver them in the presence of three or four deputies one of whom a friend of dumouriez had desired to hear the whole from their mouths it was resolved to repeat to dumouriez with a degree of solemnity what had already been represented to him in private on the necessity both for the public good and his own of making his conduct and the choice of his agents more conformable to the political principles which he professed to entertain the conversation in consequence took place in the presence of his colleagues and three or four deputies roland availing himself of the liberty to which his years and character entitled him pointed out to dumouriez the importance of his conducting himself with more strictness and prudence every one agreed that this action of bonnecarrere ought to open his eyes respecting the directorgeneral and determine him to bestow the place on another dumouriez whom the talents of bonnecarrere wellsuited and who gave himself little concern on the score of morality listened to the remarks of his friends with great indifference and at length rejected them with anger from that moment he discontinued to see the deputies was more cool to his colleagues    and no doubt thought only of displacing those whose gravity most displeased him i foresaw the effect of this conference and said to roland if you were an intriguer capable of modelling your conduct after the errours of the ancient court and its practice i would say that the moment is come to ruin dumouriez lest he play you some ill turn but honest men understand not this petty warfare and roland was as incapable of having recourse to it as illfitted to conduct it the postponement of the sanction became a refusal the utmost verge of delay was at hand we felt that the council not possessing sufficient unity and vigour to deliver its sentiments in a body it befitted the integrity and courage of roland to advance alone and between us we concluded on his famous letter to the king he had carried it with him to the council to read it openly the very day when the king pressed anew for his sanction required each of his ministers to give him his opinion written and signed and quickly diverted the conversation to other affairs roland returned home added a few missive lines to his letter and delivered the whole into the hands of the king the   th of june in the morning the next day the   th in the evening servan came to our house with a smiling countenance and said to me give me joy i have the honour of being dismissed—my husband then replied i will soon share it and i am a little piqued that you take the lead—he related to me that having gone to the king in the morning on some private affairs he had spoken to him with warmth on the necessity of the camp of    twenty thousand men if he meant sincerely to oppose the designs of the enemy that the king turned his back upon him in very ill humour and that dumouriez at the instant came from the waroffice whither he had gone to take his portfolio in virtue of an order of which he was the bearer—dumouriez—yes he is acting a vile part but i am not surprised at it—the three preceding days dumouriez had been frequently at the tuileries and held long conferences with the queen with whom it may not be impertinent to observe bonnecarrere had some interest through the women roland informed that servan was in my apartment quitted the persons to whom he was giving audience heard what had occurred and invited his colleagues dumouriez excepted to come to him it was rolands opinion that they should not wait for their dismission but that of servan being pronounced it became all who professed the same principles to offer their resignations unless the king recalled servan and dismissed dumouriez with whom they could no longer sit at the counciltable had the four ministers acted thus the court i have no doubt would have been a little embarrassed to replace them lacoste and duranthon would have done themselves honour and the affair would have been rendered more striking to the public but it became so in a different manner the ministers arrived and deliberated together without coming to any resolution except that they should meet the next morning at eight and roland should prepare a letter in the mean time i could    never have believed had not circumstances brought me to experience it how rarely correctness of judgment and firmness of character are to be found consequently how few men are fit for the management of affairs and still less to govern would you have these two qualities united to perfect disinterestedness in one man he is the phenix scarcely possible to be found it is no longer surprising to me that men superiour to the vulgar and placed at the head of empires commonly entertain a sovereign contempt for their species it is the almost inevitable consequence of an extensive knowledge of the world and to escape the faults into which it may lead them to whom the happiness of nations is entrusted requires an extraordinary fund of philosophy and magnanimity their appointment the ministers kept they hesitated about the letter and at length concluded that it would be better to go to the king and declare their sentiments in person this expedient appeared to me a mode of eluding the business a man cannot speak so forcibly as he can write to a person whom from his rank and the power of custom he would treat with great respect it was agreed to call on lacoste who had not yet made his appearance and to take him with them or at least to propose to him to join the rest scarcely had these gentlemen assembled together at the navyoffice when a message came from the king to duranthon ordering him to repair alone to the palace immediately claviere and roland said they would wait his return at the chancery it was not long before duranthon arrived and silently    with a long face and an hypocritical appearance of sorrow drew slowly from his pocket an order from the king for each of the other two—give them us said roland with a smile i perceive our dilatoriness has made us lose the start—in fact he brought their dismissions i am dismissed too said my husband to me on his return—i hope replied i that you merit it more than any other but do not by any means allow the king to announce it to the assembly and since he has not profited by the lesson given him in your letter it should be rendered useful to the public by making it acquainted with its contents nothing appears to me more consistent with the courage of having written it than the hardihood of sending a copy of it to the assembly in hearing of your dismission it should be acquainted with its cause this idea could not be other than highly pleasing to my husband it was adopted and the world knows how the assembly honoured the three ministers by declaring that they carried with them the regret of the nation as it approved the letter by ordering it to be printed and sent to the departments in my own mind i am convinced and i think the event has demonstrated that the letter of roland contributed greatly to enlighten france it exhibited to the king with so much force and wisdom what his own interest required him to perform that it was natural to infer he would not have refused his compliance were he not determined to oppose the maintenance of the constitution when i recollect that pache was in rolands closet    when we read the copy of that letter and deemed it a bold step when i reflect how often that man has witnessed our enthusiasm in the cause of liberty and our zeal to serve it and now see him at the head of that arbitrary authority which oppresses us and persecutes us as the enemies of the republic i ask myself whether i be awake or whether the dream must not terminate in the punishment of that infamous hypocrite thus we returned to private life perhaps i shall be asked whether i never had any more circumstantial account of the manner in which roland was called to the ministry this i can affirm i have not and even that it never occurred to me to inquire further concerning it for it appeared to me to be brought about in the same way in which so many other things are in this world the idea occurred to some one many approved it and thus supported it reached some person capable of carrying it into effect i saw that it had struck some of the deputies who first proposed it i know not or by whom it was imparted to the court roland neither knew more of it nor gave himself farther concern about it than i when a successor to degrave was thought of for the war department the ministers and patriotic deputies did not know whom to select almost all the officers of the army of any repute were supposed enemies to the constitution roland thought of servan who was in the service and had obtained the cross of st lewis and whose principles were not dubious for he had displayed them before the revolution in a performance much applauded the citizen    soldier we knew him personally having seen him at lyons where he had the not unmerited reputation of an active and sagacious man finally in    0 he had lost a place at court where his civism was not agreeable to guynardstpriest these considerations led the members of the council to join in proposing him to the king by whom he was accepted when my husband became minister i imposed it on myself as a law neither to pay or receive visits nor invite to my table any female i had no great sacrifices to make on this head for not residing constantly at paris my circle was far from extensive and besides i had no where kept a great deal of company for i am as fond of study as i am averse to cards and the society of silly people affords me no pleasure accustomed to spend my days in domestic retirement i shared the labours of roland and cultivated my own particular tastes the establishment of this strict rule therefore sheltered me from the inconveniences to which an interested crowd exposes persons connected with great places and enabled me to live in my own way of company i had never to speak properly any circle twice a week i received at my table some of the deputies and of the ministers and persons with whom it was necessary for my husband to converse or keep up his connections business was talked of before me because i had no desire of interfering in it and was not surrounded with company to occasion distrust from all the rooms of a spacious apartment i had chosen for my common habitation the smallest salon forming a closet in which i had placed my books and a bureau it often happened    that some of the friends or colleagues of the minister wanting to speak to him privately would come to my apartment instead of going to his where he was surrounded by his clerks or the public and request me to send for him thus i was acquainted with the course of affairs without intrigue or idle curiosity roland also took pleasure in conversing with me about them afterwards in private with that confidence which always reigned between us and made of our knowledge and opinions one common stock it happened too sometimes that friends who had only a piece of information to communicate or a word to say always sure of finding me came to desire me to communicate it to him the first opportunity it had been found necessary to counterbalance the influence of the court the aristocracy the civil list and the papers on their side by popular instructions of great publicity a daily paper to be posted up in the strects seemed well calculated for this purpose but then it was necessary to find a judicious and enlightened man capable of following up events and exhibiting them in their proper colours to conduct it louvet already known as an author a man of letters and a politician was mentioned approved and accepted the office a fund also was requisite for its support this was another affair petion himself had none for the police yet this was indispensable in a city like paris and in such a state of things when it was of importance to have people in pay in order to be informed in time of what might happen or what was contriving to have obtained any thing from the assembly would have been difficult as the demand  0 would have given the alarm to the partisans of the court and met many obstacles it occurred that dumouriez who had a fund for secret expenses in the department of foreign affairs might allow a monthly sum to the mayor of paris for the police and that from this should be defrayed the cost of the paper of which the minister of the home department should have the superintendance the expedient was simple and was adopted this was the origin of the sentinel in the course of july perceiving affairs daily grow worse through the perfidy of the court the progress of the foreign troops and the weakness of the assembly we considered where threatened liberty could take refuge we frequently conversed with barbaroux and servan on the excellent disposition of the south of the energy of the departments in that region and of the advantages its situation afforded for establishing a republic if the triumphant court should subjugate paris and the north we took a map and traced the line of demarcation servan studied the military positions it offered we calculated its strength we investigated the nature of its produce and the means of altering it each recollected places or persons of whom we might expect the support and insisted that after a revolution affording such grand hopes we must not relapse into slavery but strain every nerve to establish somewhere a free government that must be our resource said barbaroux if the marseillese whom i accompanied hither be not sufficiently seconded by the parisians to subdue the court i hope however that they will    effect it and that we shall have a convention which will give a republican government to all france we immediately perceived without his explaining himself farther that an insurrection was ripening which appeared inevitable since the court was making preparations that indicated a design of enforcing submission there are who will say these were made in its own defence but the idea of attack would not have entered into the imagination of any one or at least would not have been embraced by the people in general if the court had sincerely cooperated in carrying the constitution into effect for though aware of all its defects the most strenuous republicans desired nothing more than that constitution at the moment and would have quietly awaited its improvement from time and experience it is true that at the period of a revolution there will always be found particularly amongst a corrupt people and in large cities a class of men destitute of the advantages of fortune yet covetous of her favours and eager to extort them at any price or accustomed to supply them by means little consonant with equity if a daring mind courageous disposition and some native talents distinguish one of these he becomes the chief or leader of a turbulent band quickly recruited by all those who having nothing to lose are ready to attempt any thing by all the dupes they have art to make and by certain individuals disseminated among them by domestic politicians or foreign powers interested in something divisions to weaken those who are agitated by them and afterwards turn them to their own advantage    the patriotic societies those collections of men assembled to deliberate on their rights and interests have exhibited to us a picture in miniature of what passes in the great society of the nation first we have a few men of ardent dispositions strongly penetrated with a sense of the public danger and seeking with sincerity to prevent it these the philosophers join from a persuasion that this junction is necessary to overturn the dominion of tyranny and propagate principles beneficial to their fellowcreatures in effect grand truths are unfolded and rendered common generous sentiments are roused and diffused the impulse is given to mens heads and hearts then come forward individuals who reclothing principles and adopting a language calculated to procure their reception seek to captivate the favour of the public in order to obtain consequence or places these refine upon truths to render themselves more conspicuous heat the imagination by exaggerated pictures flatter the passions of the populace ever ready to admire the gigantic urge it to measures in which they make themselves useful that they may be always thought necessary and finish with endeavouring to excite suspicion against those prudent or enlightened men of whose merit they are afraid and with whom they could not stand in competition calumny at first employed by them without art learns from the humiliation it receives to erect itself into a system it becomes a profound science in which they and their fellows alone can succeed unquestionably many of this stamp threw themselves    into the popular party against the court ready to serve it for money and as ready to betray it if it should become the weaker side the court pretended to believe all such who opposed its designs and was fond of confounding them under the appellation of the factious the true patriots suffered this noisy pack to take its course as so many setting dogs and perhaps were not sorry to employ it as a forlorn hope that sacrificed itself to the enemy their hatred of despotism allowed them not to reflect that if it be allowable in politics to suffer good things to be effected by ill men or to profit by their excesses for some useful end it is infinitely dangerous to ascribe to them the honour of the one or not to punish them for the other all the world is acquainted with the revolution of the  0th of august i know no more concerning it than the public for though i was instructed in the grand course of affairs whilst roland was in office and attended to it with interest when he was no longer in place i never was a considant of what might be termed little manœuvres as he was never an agent in such recalled to the ministry at that period he entered it with fresh hopes for liberty it is great pity said we that the council is spoilt by that danton who has such a bad repute some friends to whom i whispered the remark said what would you do he has been of service in the revolution and the people love him we have no occasion to create malecontents and we must derive from him all the good we can—it was well said but it is much easier not to afford a man the means of influence than to prevent his abusing    it there began the faults of the patriots the instant the court was subdued an excellent council should have been formed all the members of which being irreproachable in their conduct and distinguished for their knowledge should have set forward the government with dignity and impressed foreign powers with respect to admit danton into office was to deluge the government with the men i have depicted above who harass it when not employed by it and corrupt and debase it when they participate in its operations but who was there to make these reflections who would have dared to communicate and openly maintain them the choice was determined by the assembly or its committee of twentyone in which there were many men of merit but not one leader not one of those beings such as mirabeau formed to command the vulgar to condense into one focus the opinions of the wife and to present them with that force of genius which compels obedience the moment it is displayed they did not know whom to place at the head of the navy condorcet mentioned monge because he had seen him solve geometrical problems at the academy of sciences and monge was chosen this was a sort of original very well calculated to play tricks in the manner of the bears that i have seen dance in the ditches of the town of berne there cannot be a clumsier jackpudding or less formed for pleasantry formerly a stonecutter at mézières where abbe bossuet encouraged him and set him to study mathematics he advanced himself by dint of industry and ceased to visit his benefactor as soon as he began to    entertain hopes of becoming his equal a good kind of man however or knowing enough to acquire the reputation of being so in a little circle the most satyrical members of which would not have amused themselves with holding him up as merely possessing a dull and confined understanding still he passed for an honest man and a friend of the revolution whilst it was so difficult to find people of capacity and so many had proved traitors that it began to be seemed sufficient if dependance could be placed on a mans principles i need not speak of his ministry the deplorable state of our navy too plainly evinces his incapacity and nothingness the first care of roland was to make that reform in his office of which he had felt the necessity he collected about him industrious enlightened men of firm principles and had he accomplished nothing more he would have done great benefit in that branch of administration he hastened to write to all the departments with that force which reason gives that authority which belongs to truth and that patheticalness which results from feeling his letters displayed to them the new destiny of france in the revolution of the tenth of august and the necessity for all parties to rally round justice which prevents all excesses liberty which produces the happiness of all good order which alone can insure it and the legislative body as charged with the expression of the common will those administrative bodies which appeared to hesitate were suspended or broken great dispatch in business and the most active and extensive correspondence diffused through all parts a similar spirit restored    confidence and reanimated the interiour of the kingdom danton scarcely suffered a day to pass without visiting me at one time he would come to the council a little before the time and would enter my apartment or would stay a little after it commonly with fabredeglantine at another he would invite himself to dinner with me on days when i was not accustomed to see company to converse with roland about some business it is impossible to show more zeal or a greater love of liberty and desire of unanimity with his colleagues to serve it most effectually than he displayed contemplating his forbidding and savage features though i would say to myself that no one should be judged at sight that i was not certain of any thing against him that the most honest man must have two characters when party ran high and that appearances were not to be trusted i could not bring myself to associate the idea of a good man with such a countenance i never saw any thing that so perfectly characterised the violence of brutal passions and the most astonishing audacity half cloked under a jovial air with the affectation of frankness and a sort of simplicity my lively imagination represents to me every person with whom i am struck in the action i think suitable to his character i cannot see for half an hour a face a little out of the common track without arraying it in the garb of some profession or giving it some part the idea of which it revives or impresses on my mind this imagination has often figured to me danton with a dagger in his hand encouraging by    his voice and action a troop of assassins more timid or less serocious than himself or satisfied with his crimes indicating his habits and propensities by the gestures of a sardanapalus i would defy an expert painter not to find in the person of danton all the requisites for such a composition could i confine myself to a regular path instead of abandoning my pen to the wandering course of a mind that ranges at large over the field of events i would have taken up danton at the beginning of      a poor counsellor more burdened with debts than causes and whose wife has said that she could not have kept house without the assistance of a guinea a week from her father i would have exhibited him just coming out at the section they termed the district and making himself noticed by the strength of his lungs a great sectary of the orleans party acquiring a sort of competence in the course of that year without his being perceived to do any thing to gain it and obtaining a little celebrity by excesses which lafayette would have punished but which he artfully turned to his own advantage by procuring himself to be protected by the section which he had rendered turbulent i should remark him declaiming with success in the popular societies setting himself up for the defender of the rights of all and declaring that he would accept no place of profit till after the revolution yet filling that of substitute to the solicitor of the commune preparing to build his influence at the jacobins on the ruins of that of the lameths appearing on the tenth of august with those who returned from the palace and    arriving at the ministry as a tribune in favour with the people to whom it was necessary to give the satisfaction of seeing him hold a share in the government from that period his progress was as rapid as bold he attached to himself by largesses or protected by his influence those greedy and miserable men who are the slaves of vice or want he pointed out the men he dreaded that their ruin might be effected he paid the writers and set on the enthusiasts whom he destined to worry them he refined on the revolutionary inventions of blind patriots or adroit knaves he framed decreed and caused to be carried into execution schemes capable of striking terrour removing numerous obstacles amassing heaps of wealth and misleading the public opinions on all these things by his intrigues he formed the electoral body which he openly swayed by his agents and named the deputation from paris to the convention of which he became a member to belgium he went to augment his treasures and had the boldness to avow a fortune of   00000 livres £      wallow in luxury whilst preaching up sansculolitme and sleep on mountains of dead bodies as to fabre deglantine muffled in a cowl armed with a dagger employed in laying snares for the innocent whose character he would defame or to destroy the rich whose wealth he covets he is so perfectly in his character that whoever would paint the most abandoned hypocrite need only draw his portrait thus accoutred these two men sought much to make me deliver my sentiments by talking patriotism on this subject i had nothing to conceal or dissemble i avow my principles    equally to those whom i suppose to participate in them and those whom i suspect of others less pure to those from confidence to these from pride for i disdain to practise reserve even under the pretence or hope of better penetrating the mind of another i form an opinion of men from their appearance and i judge of them by their conduct at various times compared with their language but myself i exhibit entire and leave no room to doubt of what i really am as soon as the assembly had passed of its own accord a decree which allowed the minister of the home department  00000 livres £     to defray the expenses of useful publications danton and fabre particularly asked me by way of conversation whether roland were prepared on that point had writers in readiness to employ c i answered that he was no stranger to those who had already made themselves known that such of the periodical works as were of a right temper would point out the publications which it was proper to encourage that it would be adviseable to see their authors to form a meeting of them sometimes that they might be acquainted with facts the knowledge of which it would be useful to disseminate and agree on the most efficacious method of leading mens minds to the same point that if either of them fabre or danton knew any in particular they should mention them and come with them to the minister where they might converse once a week for instance on what ought more especially to occupy their pens under the existing circumstances we have a scheme answered fabre for a paper  0 to be posted up to be entitled compte rendu au peuple souverain an account to the sovereign people which shall exhibit a sketch of the late revolution and in which camilledesmoulins robert and some others will write—very well you must introduce them to roland—this he took care not to do and spoke no more of the paper which however was begun as soon as the assembly had given the council two millions £      for secret expenses danton said to his colleagues that it was fit each minister should have the employment of a portion of this sum in his own department but those of the home department and foreign affairs having already similar funds this should be at the disposal of the other four who would thus have each so many hundred thousand livres roland strongly objected to this proposal he showed that the design of the assembly had been to give the executive power at this critical period all the necessary means of acting with promptitude that the council collectively was to decide on the employment of this fund at the demand and on the objects brought forward by each and declared that for his own part he would never make any use of it without the approbation of the council to whom the sum was intrusted and to whom it belonged to know how it was applied danton replied swore according to custom and talked of the revolution of grand measures of secresy and of freedom the others seduced    perhaps by the pleasure of playing each his own game declared for his opinion contrary to all justice delicacy and sound policy and in spite of the protests of roland and his resolute opposition the rigidity of which gave displeasure danton quickly drew his hundred thousand crowns £ 0    out of the public treasury and did with them what he thought proper yet this did not prevent his obtaining from servan  0000 l £  00 and from lebrun more out of the secret funds of their departments under different pretences to the assembly he never gave any account contenting himself with affirming that he had accounted to the council and to this council he only said at a meeting at which roland was not present on account of indisposition that he had given twenty thousand livres to one ten to another and so of the rest on account of the revolution for their patriotism and the like thus servan related the story to me the council interrogated by the assembly on the subject to the question whether danton had given them any account answered simply yes but danton had acquired so much power that these timid men were afraid to offend him immediately after the retirement of servan danton no longer finding any opposition from the waroffice poisoned the army with cordeliers as cowardly as avaricious who promoted plunder and devastation rendered the soldiers as ferocious to their countrymen as to their enemies made the revolution odious to the neighbouring people by excesses of all kinds which they practised in the name of the republic and every    where preaching insubordination prepared the misfortunes since experienced after this no one will be astonished to hear that danton wanting to send into brittany one of his creatures under pretence of visiting the seaports and examining the inspectors prevailed on the navyminister to give him a commission but commissions of this kind required the signature of all the members of the council and roland refused his either said he to monge they whom you employ do their duty or they do not and of this you are competent to judge if they do not dismiss them without hesitation if they do why damp their zeal and insult them by sending to them a stranger who has no connexion with the office and would only prove your distrust such a proceeding is by no means fitted for the character of a minister and i will not sign the commission the sitting of the council was drawn to some length towards the end papers to be signed became numerous roland perceived that he had put his name after those of all his colleagues to the commission he had refused to sign which had been slidden into his hand he cancelled it therefore and upbraided monge who whispered him it is dantons desire if i refuse he will denounce me to the commune to the cordeliers and will get me hanged—well i a minister would die before i would yield to such considerations the bearer of this commission was arrested in brittany by order of an administration offended with his conduct the cancelled signature of roland appeared to it a sufficient motive to examine the conduct of    the bearer narrowly and there were heavy complaints against him but it was at the end of the year when the mountain openly took the part of all anarchists and it procured a decree that guermeur should be set at liberty i have suffered myself to be hurried away by circumstances let me now resume the chain of facts danton and fabre ceased to visit me towards the latter end of august no doubt they were cautious of exposing themselves to attentive eyes when they chanted the matins of september and they were sufficiently informed of the disposition of roland and those about him a firm noble and open disposition strict principles displayed without ostentation yet unconstrained and an even and regular conduct were conspicuous to every eye hence they concluded that roland was an honest man with whom there was nothing to be done in enterprises like theirs that his wife had no weak place by means of which he could be swayed that equally firm in her principles she possessed perhaps more of that penetration peculiar to her sex which deceitful people have most reason to fear perhaps too they guessed that she could sometimes wield a pen and that such a couple of strong reason firm character and some talents might be injurious to their designs and were fit only to be ruined the course of events illustrated by a number of circumstances which it would be difficult for me to detail at present but of which a lively impression remains on my mind gives to these conjectures all the evidence of demonstration one of the first measures thought proper to be taken    by the council was to dispatch to the departments commissioners instructed to explain the events of the  0th of august and particularly to rouse the minds of the people to prepare for defence be expeditious in raising the necessary recruits for the armies opposed to the enemy on the frontiers c when it was agreed to send them and the subject of choosing proper agents came to be discussed roland demanded to have till the next day to consider whom he could propose—i will take it all upon myself cried danton the commune of paris will furnish us with excellent patriots—the indolent majority of the council intrusted to him the care of pointing them out and the next day he came to the council with commissions ready made so that nothing more was necessary than to fill them up with the names he presented and sign them the council examined them very little and affixed their signatures without debating the subject thus a swarm of men scarcely known intriguers of sections or bawlers of clubs patriots from sublimation and still more from interest for the most part destitute of any mode of getting a livelihood except what they might assume or hope to acquire in public commotions but completely devoted to danton their protector and enamoured of his manners and licentious doctrines became the representatives of the executive council throughout the departments of france this business always appeared to me one of the grandest partystrokes of danton and most humiliating lessons for the council it is necessary to reflect how fully each minister was    already occupied in the affairs of his own department in those turbulent times to conceive how it could be possible that honest men by no means destitute of capacity could have acted with such inconsideration the fact is the ministers of the home naval and military departments were so burdened with multiplicity of business that particular affairs too completely absorbed their thoughts to allow them time to reflect on the grand outlines of the political system the council ought to have been composed of men whose sole employment should be to deliberate on affairs not to carry them into execution danton filled that post where least was to be done besides he gave himself little concern about executing the duties of his office which he scarcely permitted to occupy any part of his attention his clerks turned the wheel he trusted to them his hand and the machine went on just as it could without giving him any anxiety all his time and attention were dedicated to intrigues and calculations to promote his views of augmenting his wealth and power at the waroffice he was continually procuring his own creatures to be placed with the armies he found means to get them concerned in the contracts for it of every kind he neglected no quarter in which he could advance these men the dregs of a corrupted nation of which they rose the scum during the political ferment at the top of which they must swim for a time with these he augmented his credit and made himself a faction that soon became powerful for it is now paramount the enemy advanced on our territories its progress    became alarming men who would lead the people and who have studied the means of swaying them know fear to be one of the most powerful this affection places them who experience it in complete subjection to them who permit it to have no influence on their minds how great the advantage of those who designedly inspire it by false rumours or pretences this calculation had assuredly been made by the instigators of the proceedings of september they must have had the twofold object of producing a tumult under favour of which the violation of the prisons and massacre of the prisoners would afford them an opportunity of satiating their private animosities and gratifying their avarice by plunder and at the same time of spreading abroad that kind of stupor during which the little band of daring and ambitious men might lay the foundations of their power inferiour agents were not difficult to be gained by the lure of profit the pretence of immolating supposed traitors from whom conspiracies would be professed to be dreaded must seduce some weak heads deceive the people and serve to justify the action whence the directors would obtain the blind devotion of their amplypaid satellites the attachment of all who shared the profits with their leaders and the submission of the intimidated people surprised at the energy or persuaded of the justice of an operation to which it would be enchained by having it represented as its own work thus whoever durst afterwards reprobate these crimes was proclaimed a calumniator of the city of paris pointed out as such to the fury of a certain class of its inhabitants and styled a federalist and a    conspirator such was the crime of the twentytwo joined to the unpardonable guilt of superiority a report of the taking of verdun was loudly propagated on the first of september with great alarm the officiating preacher to the mob affirmed the enemy to be in full march to chalons to listen to them it would be at paris in three days and the people who considered nothing but the distance without estimating every thing necessary to the march of an army for its provision baggage and artillery and all that render its progress so very different from that of an individual already beheld the foreign troops pillaging the smoking ruins of the capital nothing was neglected that could inflame the imagination amplify objects or augment the apprehension of danger it was not difficult to obtain from the assembly some measures adapted to promote the design domiciliary visits under the pretence of searching for arms concealed or discovering persons suspected which have become so frequent since the tenth of august were decreed as general procedures and executed in the dead of the night they gave occasion to fresh and numerous captions and unheard of vexations the commune of the tenth composed in great part of those men who having nothing to lose have every thing to gain by a revolution already guilty of a thousand enormities had need of committing more for the accumulation of crimes alone can secure impunity the misfortunes of the country were solemnly announced the signal of distress the black flag was hoisted on the tower of the metropolitan church the alarmgun was fired the commune    proclaimed by sound of trumpet a general assembly of the citizens on sunday the  d in the champdemars to rally round the altar of the nation those zealous patriots who would immediately set off for its defence yet it directed the gates to be shut and no one was struck with the contradictoriness of these proceedings the talk was of a conspiracy forming in the prisons by the aristocrats or the rich who were confined in them in great numbers and of the uneasiness and repugnance of the people to quit their hearths and leave behind them those ravenous wolves who soon unchained would fall upon all they had left behind them most dear at the first symptoms of commotion the minister of the homedepartment whose it is to watch over the general tranquillity but who has not the immediate exercise of power or employment of force wrote in a pressing manner to the commune in the person of the mayor to urge on it the vigilance it ought to display he contented himself not with this he addressed himself to the commandantgeneral to exhort him to strengthen the posts and keep an eye on the prisons he did more hearing that the prisons were threatened he officially required him to guard them with care making his head responsible for events and to give more efficacy to a requisition to which his authority was restrained he caused it to be printed and posted up at the corner of every street this was directing the citizens to guard them themselves if the commandant should neglect his duty at five in the evening of sunday nearly at the very moment when the prisons were surrounded as i have    since been informed about two hundred men came to the office of the homedepartment loudly calling for the minister and for arms from my own retired apartment i thought i heard some noise i quitted it and from a room looking into the great court i perceived the mob thence i repaired to the antichamber to inquire the cause roland was gone out but they who demanded him were not satisfied with this but were determined to speak to him the servants refused them admission persisting in the truth i ordered them to go and invite ten of them in they entered i asked them calmly what they wanted they told me they were honest citizens ready to depart for verdun but in want of arms for which they came to ask the minister and they must see him i observed to them that the minister of the homedepartment never had arms at his disposal and that they should demand them at the waroffice from the minister at war they replied they had been there and were told there was none that all those ministers were f— of traitors and they wanted roland—i am sorry he is gone out for his solid arguments would have weight with you come and go through the house with me and you shall satisfy yourselves that he is not at home and that he has no arms which on reflection you will be convinced he ought not to have return to the waroffice or carry your just complaints to the commune or if you will speak to roland repair to the navyoffice where all the council is assembled—they withdrew i went into the balcony over the court and thence i beheld a furious fellow in his shirt  00 with his sleeves tucked up to his shoulders sabre in hand declaiming against the treachery of the ministers my ten deputies dispersed themselves amongst the crowd and at length determined it to retreat with drums beating and carrying away the valetdechambre as an hostage who was forced to pace the streets for an hour when he was permitted to depart immediately i got into a coach and hastened to the navyoffice to inform my husband of what had passed the council was not yet formed i found a numerous circle in which were several deputies the ministers at war and of justice not being arrived the others were in the salon as a private company i related the story on which each made his remarks most supposed it the fortuitous result of circumstances and the effervescence of the peoples minds what was danton then doing i knew not till several days after but it may be proper to mention it here in the order of facts he was at the residence of the mayor in the committee of superintendance as it was styled from which issued the orders for the arrests which had been so numerous within a few days there a reconciliation had just taken place between him and marat after the parade of a feigned quarrel for fourandtwenty hours he went to pétions apartment took him aside and said to him in his strong language can you guess what they have taken into their heads would you have imagined that they had issued a mandate to apprehend roland—who have—that furious committee i have laid hold of the mandate see here it is we cannot suffer them to act thus what the devil against a member of the council—pétion took the mandate read it returned it to him with a smile  0  and said let them do it it will have a good effect—a good effect replied danton inquisitively examining the mayors countenance o i will not suffer it i will go and make them listen to reason the mandate was not carried into execution but who is there that does not see that the two hundred men were sent to the minister of the home department by the authors of the mandate who is there that does not suspect that the inutility of their attempt delaying the execution of their project might occasion them who conceived it to hesitate who is there that does not perceive in the conduct of danton with the mayor that of a conspirator who would sound the effect of such a stroke or take to himself the honour of having parried it when he found it had failed or been rendered dubious by accidental delay the ministers left the council a little after eleven it was not till the next morning we learnt the horrours of which the night had been witness and which still continued to reign in the prisons our hearts bursting with the thoughts of these abominable crimes the inability of preventing them and the evident accord between the commune and the commandantgeneral we were persuaded that nothing remained  0  for a virtuous minister but to announce them with the greatest vehemence to engage the assembly to stay them to raise the indignation of all honest men against them and thus to wash away the dishonour of having shared in them by silence nay to expose himself if so it must be to the daggers of the assassins to avoid the guilt and shame of being in any measure their accomplice—it is equally true said i to my husband that the resolutions of courage are not more consonant to justice than they are conducive to safety firmness alone can repress audacity if the denunciation of these enormities were not a duty it would be an act of prudence the perpetrators of  0  them must hate you for you have endeavoured to prune their wings nothing remains for you but to inspire them with fear roland wrote to the assembly his letter of the third of september which became equally celebrated with that he had addressed to the king the assembly received it with transport it ordered it to be printed posted up and sent to the departments it applauded it as weak men applaud acts of courage they cannot imitate but which affect themselves and inspire them with some hope i remember having read a little work strongly aristocratic published some time since at london i believe by pelletier the author of which is greatly astonished that the same man who had so audaciously offended his king afterwards displayed so much justice and humanity either the spirit of party must render a man extremely inconsistent or virtue is so rare that its very existence is become questionable the friend of freedom and his fellowcreatures detests with equal vehemence and proclaims with equal energy the tyranny of a mob and the tyranny of a king the despotism of a throne and the disorders of anarchy the wiliness of courts and the ferociousness of robbers that same day the  d of september a man formerly a colleague of roland and to whom i thought i owed the civility of inviting him to dinner took it into his head to bring with him the orator of the human race without mentioning it to me or asking my permission this breach of politeness appeared to me the venial offence of an honest man dazzled by the orators fame i received with civility clootz of whom i knew nothing more than his bombast orations and  0  of whom i had no unfavourable memorandum but one of my friends seeing him whispered in my ear your guest has introduced to you an insufferable parasite whom i am sorry to see here— the conversation turned on the events of the day clootz pretended to prove that they were indispensable and salutary measures uttered many commonplace observations on the rights of the people the justice of their vengeance and its subserviency to the happiness of mankind spoke loud and long ate still more than he spoke and tired more than one auditor soon after appointed deputy he returned occasionally of his own accord seating himself in the first place and helping himself to the nicest dishes without ceremony my extreme and cold politeness accompanied with the care i always took to help several persons before him soon gave him to understand that he held no high place in my esteem he perceived it came no more and revenged himself by calumnies i should not have mentioned this contemptible fellow but for the distinguished part he acted amongst the slanderers of good men and the art with which he joined in making of federalism a scarecrow for fools or a title of proscription for those of good understanding who embraced not his chimera of an universal commonwealth the last time he came to visit me he mounted his hobbyhorse and repeated all his extravagancies on the possibility of a convention formed of deputies from every corner of the world some of the company answered him with a jest roland tired of the noise and pedantry with which clootz maintained  0  his opinion and pretended to make converts to it had the civility to flourish an argument or two with him and then turned away to another part of the room the conversation cooled and broke off into different subjects buzot whose solid understanding never amuses itself long with attacking castles in the air was astonished that federation should be treated as a heresy in politics he observed that greece so celebrated so prolific of great men and heroic actions was composed of small confederate republics that the united states which in our own days exhibit the most interesting picture of a good social organization form a composition of the same nature and that switzerland presented a similar example that in truth at the present moment and in the actual situation of france it was important for it to maintain unity because thus it formed a mass more likely to be respected by foreign powers and possessed a singleness of action which would be of precious account for the completion of the laws that must insure it a constitution yet it could not be dissembled that there would ever be a laxity in the political bands which united a fleming and a native of provence that it was difficult to make that attachment in which the strength of a republic consists reign over a surface so extensive for the love of our country is not strictly that of the land we inhabit but of the citizens with whom we dwell and the laws by which they are governed otherwise the athenians could not have transferred their existence as such from their city to their ships that we can never thoroughly love any but those whom we know and that the enthusiasm of men  0  separated by a distance of six hundred miles can never be general uniform and vivid like that of the inhabitants of a small territory these sage reflections so esteemed by most of those who heard them were traduced and denounced by clootz as a conspiracy to federate france and detach it from the department of paris he represented buzot as the most dangerous of the conspirators roland as their chief and the deputies who visited me most frequently as partizans of this liberticide project i know not whether a madman like clootz can have been sincere in his apprehensions but i cannot bring myself to believe him so firmly persuaded that he saw in the fabrication of his lie an opportunity of revenging his selflove offended at not being admired a subject for declaiming in his own way extremely suitable to the turgidity of his style and the disorder of his imagination and a mean of injuring men whose understanding must displease him and making a common cause with those in whose vices he delights even supposing him to have no secret mission to embroil france by the help of the bedlamites to smooth the way for his countrymen the prussians the massacres notwithstanding continued at the abbey from sunday evening till tuesday morning at the bridewell longer at the bicêtre four days c to my present abode in the first of these prisons i am indebted for particulars which would make the reader thrill with horrour but which i have not courage to write one circumstance however i will not pass over in silence because it tends to demonstrate that it was a deeplaid scheme in the suburb of st  0  germain there is a house of confinement to receive prisoners which the abbey cannot admit when it is already full and the police chose sunday evening to remove them the instant before the general massacre began the assassins were ready fell upon the hackney coaches of which there were five or six and stabbed and murdered with sabres and pikes all that were in them in the middle of the street and unchecked by their doleful cries all paris witnessed these terrible scenes perpetrated by a small number of cutthroats so small that there were scarcely more than a dozen at the abbey the gate of which was defended notwithstanding the requisitions made to the commune and the commandant only by two national guards all paris suffered them to go on—all paris was accursed in my eyes and i could no longer entertain hopes of the establishment of liberty amongst cowards insensible to the last outrages against nature and humanity frigid spectators of crimes which the courage of fifty armed men could with ease have prevented the public force was badly organized as it is still for the miscreants take great care when they would reign to oppose all kind of order that might tie their hands but is it necessary for men to know their captain and march in regular order of battle when they have to fly to the assistance of victims about to be murdered the fact is the rumour of a pretended conspiracy in the prisons completely improbable as it was and the affected enunciation of the uneasiness and rage of the people held every one in a state of stupor and persuaded him shut up in his house that  0  the people were the actors when from all accounts there were not two hundred villains in the whole employed on this infamous purpose it is not the first night therefore that astonishes me but four days—and curious people went to see this spectacle—no i know nothing in the annals of the most barbarous people to be compared with this atrocious deed the health of roland was impaired by it the disturbance of the nervous system was so great that his stomach could bear nothing and the bile obstructed in its course diffused itself on the surface of the skin he was yellow and weak yet his industry was not diminished unable to eat or sleep he desisted not from his labours he was still ignorant of his having been the object of arrest though i had heard of it for i could by no means think of acquainting him with what would have only tended to exasperate a complaint already serious some one however i know not who mentioned it to him the week following it must be confessed that he afterwards spoke of the subject sometimes so that his enemies affected to repeat that he declaimed against these executions only from the fear he had of being comprehended in the number of their victims whilst in reality to the just horrour with which they had inspired him he only added indignation at having been reckoned amongst those who were destined to fall by them danton was the man who most endeavoured to represent the opposition of roland to these events as the fruit of an ardent imagination and the terrour with which he feigned he was struck i always thought much might be inferred from this circumstance  0  history no doubt will preserve the infamous circular letter of the committee of superintendance of the commune containing an apology for the transactions of september and an invitation to perpetrate the like throughout all france a letter of which numbers were expedited from the office of the minister of justice and countersigned by him circumstances indicating the inconvenience of bringing to paris the prisoners from orleans whose removal had been decreed and who were already on the road the minister of the home department gave orders by advice of the council to conduct them to versailles and a numerous escort was sent for this purpose certain men pretending to be penetrated with horrour at the assassinations of paris insinuated themselves into it under this cloak and were the authors of the butchery perpetrated on the prisoners in the waggons on their arrival at versailles the money notes jewels and other valuables of which there was abundance in the prisons at that time from the wealth and condition of those by whom they were filled were pillaged as may be supposed much more considerable had been the plunder made by the members of the commune after the  0th of august at the palace of the tuileries or in the royal houses near it to which it sent commissioners or in the houses of private persons said to be suspected on whose property it had affixed seals the commune had received considerable deposites and it had removed much treasure no account appeared and the minister of the home department   0 could not obtain the information he had a right to demand concerning them he complained to the assembly as he did also of the negligence of the commandantgeneral from whom he requested in vain a more numerous guard for the post of the jeweloffice villains in the mean time hesitated at nothing watches shoebuckles earrings were taken from people in the marketplaces and public walks in broad day the assembly as usual commended the ministers zeal directed him to make a report of the state of paris and took no measures whatever the pillage of the jeweloffice was effected millions fell into the hands of persons who would naturally employ them to perpetuate anarchy the source of their power deglantine who had never visited me after the matins of september who the last time i saw him said to me as from a profound sense of the critical state of france things will never go well without a concentration of powers the executive council must have the dictatorship and its president must exercise it came to me the morning after this important robbery at eleven oclock he came but i was not at home for i had just gone out with madam pétion he waited for me two hours i found him in the court at my return he went in with me uninvited he remained an hour and half unasked to sit down with an hypocritical tone he lamented the robbery of that night which deprived the nation of real wealth he inquired whether no information of its authors had been obtained and he professed astonishment at its not having been foreseen then he talked     of robespierre and marat who had begun to revile roland and me and called them hotheaded men who must be permitted to go on their own way wellmeaning extremely zealous who were startled at every thing but whose conduct ought to create no alarm i suffered him to talk as he pleased said little and expressed my opinion of nothing he withdrew and i have not seen him since the purpose of this singular visit has never yet been known to me it remains for time to unfold i have said that marat began to revile us it should be told that the moment the assembly had decreed a sum at the disposal of the minister of the home department for printing useful works marat who the day after the  0th had caused four presses to be taken from the royal printing house by his people to indemnify him for those which the hand of justice had taken from him wrote to roland for fifteen thousand livres £    to enable him to publish some excellent things roland answered that the sum was too great to be delivered without knowing the object on which it was to be employed and if marat would send his manuscripts to him he would not take upon himself to decide on them but would lay them before the council to determine whether they ought to be printed at the expense of the nation marat replied rudely enough of which he is extremely capable and sent a heap of manuscripts the very sight of which was enough to frighten any one there was an essay on the chains of slavery and i know not what besides quite in his own style which is saying sufficient i had sometimes doubted whether marat were not     a fictitious person but then i was convinced that such a being really existed i spoke of him to danton expressed a desire of seeing him and begged he would introduce him to me for it is not amiss to have a knowledge of monsters and my curiosity was excited to learn whether he were a man who had lost his wits or a wellprompted actor danton excused himself under pretence of its being completely useless and even disagreeable as it would only present me an original answering to nothing from the tone of his excuse i guessed he would not have gratified my fancy had i insisted upon it so i did not appear to have thought of it seriously the council decided that the manuscripts of marat should be put into the hands of danton who would know how to settle the matter with him this was cutting the gordian knot instead of untying it it was not proper for the minister of the home department to expend the public money in feeing a madman it was not prudent for him to make him an enemy a simple flat refusal from the council would have removed every difficulty entrusting this office to danton was affording him a fresh opportunity of attaching to himself this mad dog that he might set him on to bite and worry whom he pleased three weeks and more had passed away and the transactions of september were at an end marat had the impudence to post up a demand of fifteen thousand livres from dorleans with a complaint of the incivism of the minister in refusing him that sum and published a libel against me personally i did not give into the snare—this said i to my husband is danton downright     he wants to attack you and begins by prowling round you he has the folly to suppose that these silly things will affect me and that i shall take up the pen to answer them so that he will bring forward a woman upon the stage and thus render ridiculous the man to whom i am allied these fellows may form some opinion of my qualifications but of my mind they can frame no judgment let them slander me as long as they please they will never move me to complain or to regard them roland made his report of the state of paris on the   d of september it was exact and spirited that is to say it depicted the disorders that had been committed and the imprudence of leaving the constituted authorities any longer in the greatest insubordination and the most dangerous exercise of arbitrary power he did justice to the zeal of the commune of the  0th and the service it did the revolution on that day but he showed that the prolongation of the employment of revolutionary measures would produce exactly the reverse of what was hoped from them since the purpose of destroying tyranny was to introduce the reign of justice and order with which anarchy was equally incompatible and he demonstrated the equity of demanding and the difficulty of obtaining accounts from that commune from which he had required them in vain the assembly capable of perceiving the right but from weakness unable to pursue it applauded the report ordered it to be printed decreed little and rectified nothing it is scarcely possible to conceive a situation more painful than that of a firm and upright     man who at the head of a great administration in which he appears to have considerable power and is actually burdened with high responsibility daily witnesses disgusting abuses which he can do no more than denounce and to remedy which the legislative authority he informs of them can or dares do nothing to cashier the commune order a new municipality to be elected according to the forms prescribed by law to organize the common force and cause a commander to be appointed it by the sections were the only measures that could establish order in paris without which the laws would be appealed to in vain and for want of which a convention there must necessarily be subject to the municipal authority which knew no restraint in such a state of things i would rather that roland dedicated his talents to his country as a deputy than as member of a council without energy and minister of a government without a capacity of acting i did not conceal these sentiments from some who were capable of appreciating them but the vulgar could not have comprehended the preference of an humble sphere to the honours and throng of ministerial office and for want of this comprehension would have formed unlucky conjectures the department of the somme in which roland had long resided chose him for its representative this choice excited almost universal regret it appeared inconsiderate and absurd to take from the helm a man of integrity courage and understanding whom it would be difficult to replace in order to put him into an assembly where numbers could serve the state by their votes without possessing his capacity roland     made no hesitation he wrote to the assembly in consequence requesting it to appoint him a successor and mentioning a person whom he thought qualified to fill his office this news occasioned great agitation exclamations arose against it on all sides and a motion was made that he should be invited to retain his office the convention was already formed by the number of deputies to the legislative assembly who were chosen members of it also and those who first arrived from the country or the latter had taken their places in the legislative assembly which of the two was the case i do not perfectly recollect at this moment and i have nothing to consult for information but danton was present and rose to oppose this invitation with great warmth his impetuosity betrayed his rancour and led him to say many ridiculous things amongst others that they ought to address the invitation to me also for i was by no means unimportant to the administration of roland murmurs of disapprobation attended his invidious remarks but the decree did not pass though the general with was strongly expressed the ministers resignation however was not accepted and he was still left free to make his option a crowd of deputies repaired to his house to prevail on him not to quit the ministry it was strongly urged on him as a sacrifice he owed his country and it was represented to     him that the convention when once complete would give affairs a grand and decisive course in which his activity and disposition were necessary and by which he would be supported two days passed in these solicitations when he was informed that his election was void because it had been made to replace another supposed null but in reality not so and therefore he had no reason to quit the ministry accordingly he resolved to remain in it and wrote to the assembly in a style of courage and dignity which was crowned with the plaudits of the majority and made his enemies tremble his election was indeed not valid but the party of danton strove to conceal this till he had quitted the ministry that he might be thrown out of every situation from that time the party pursued him without remission every day there was some fresh attack the journal of marat pamphlets composed for the purpose and denunciations at the jacobins incessantly repeated calumnies and accusations each more stupid or more atrocious than its predecessor but effrontery and perseverance in things of this kind have always success with a people naturally fickle and suspicious they went so far even as to impute to him as a crime what ought to have procured him praise and had the art to inspire honest men void of courage with alarm at that very solicitude which was most conducive to the safety of the common wealth i mean the care of instructing the public opinion it requires no profound skill in politics to know that from public opinion arises the strength of a government all the difference in this respect that exists between a tyrannical administration and one     which takes justice for its basis is that the former is employed wholly in narrowing the sphere of light and suppressing truth whilst the latter makes it a law to diffuse them as widely as possible the assembly had rightly judged that the events of the  0th of august would produce different impressions according to the prejudices or interests of individuals and the manner in which they were represented it directed a narrative of the facts therefore to be drawn up decreed it should be printed supported it by the publication of all the documents necessary to prove its accuracy charged the minister of the home department to expedite it together with these throughout all france and enjoined him to promote the writing of pamphlets conducive to the same end roland felt that in the present circumstance the act of diffusing information needed improvement and that it was requisite to form a stream of light to supply in some measure the want of public instruction ever too much neglected he made inquiry in the departments and secured there a small number of zealous and enlightened men on whose fidelity in distributing such writings as might be sent them he could depend he made it a rule to answer every thing and to keep up a correspondence with all the popular societies country clergymen and private persons who should write to him to the societies he sent a circular letter reminding them of the spirit of their institution and inculcating into them the fraternal care of instructing and enlightening each other from which they had too great tendency to swerve in order to deliberate and rule he selected out of his offices three     or four perions of good sense to keep up this patriotic correspondence and dispatch the printed tracts under the direction of him amongst them who had most sensibility of heart strictness of principle and amenity of style this correspondence he frequently animated with his own circular letters dictated by circumstances and always breathing that morality and that charm of affection which engage mens hearts the excellent effect resulting from this cannot easily be conceived troubles of every kind subsided the administrative bodies executed their functions with regularity five or six hundred societies and a considerable number of country clergymen employed themselves with affecting zeal to diffuse instruction and to render interested and concerned for the public welfare men hitherto occupied wholly in their manual labours abandoned to ignorance and more disposed to receive chains than to maintain that freedom of which they knew neither the extent nor the limits neither the rights nor the duties this patriotic correspondence is a valuable monument equally attesting the pure principles and enlightened vigilance of the minister the good will of a great number of prudent citizens and the admirable fruits of wisdom patriotism and reason in the thing itself and in its effects suspicious and jealous men saw less the triumph of freedom the maintenance of tranquillity and the consolidation of the republic than the same and reputation that might accrue from them to the first mover from that moment roland was represented as a dangerous man who had offices of public opinion and soon as a corruptor     of the peoples judgment a man ambitious of the supreme power and finally as a conspirator it was only necessary to read his writings and examine his correspondence the departments that received his letters answered him with their warmest thanks but the banditti of paris still persevered in slander without proving any thing and excited by a thousand arts a sort of mistrust and of popular opinion which the jacobins seconded with all their power for they were wholly swayed by danton robespierre and marat— note st pélagie august        more than two months have i been imprisoned because i am related to a good man who took it into his head to retain his virtue in a revolution and give in exact accounts being a minister for five months he had solicited in vain the settlement of his accounts and the passing of judgment on his administration they have been examined but as nothing has been found in them to blame it has not been thought proper to make any report and he has been slandered the activity of roland his multifarious labours and his enlightened writings acquired him a degree of reputation which has been thought dangerous or at least envious men have made it believed so to effect the downfal of a man whose integrity they detested his ruin was resolved and an attempt was made to take him into custody at the time of the insurrection on the   st of may the epoch of the complete debasement and violation of the representative body of the nation and   0 the success of the decemvirate he has escaped for rage they have seized me though they would have apprehended me otherwise for our perfecutors if they know my name has not the influence of his are persuaded that my temper possesses not less firmness and they are almost equally desirous of my ruin the first part of my captivity i employed in writing this i did with so much rapidity and was so happily disposed for it that in less than a month i had manuscripts sufficient to have formed a duodecimo volume under the title of historical memoirs they consisted of details relative to all the facts and all the persons connected with public affairs that my situation had brought to my knowledge i related them with all the freedom and energy of my character with all the negligence of frankness the unconstraint of a mind superiour to selfish considerations the pleasure of describing what i had felt or experienced and finally in confidence that whatever might happen the collection would form my moral and political testament i had completed the whole bringing things down to the present moment and i had entrusted it to a friend who set upon it the highest value on a sudden the storm burst over him the instant he saw himself put under arrest he thought of nothing but the danger he felt only the necessity of parrying it and without ruminating on expedients he threw my manuscript into the fire this loss agitated my mind more than the rudest shocks had ever done it is not difficult to conceive this if it be recollected that the crisis approaches that i may be massacred tomorrow     or dragged i know not how before the tribunal employed by those who rule to rid them of persons they find troublesome and that these writings were the anchor to which i entrusted the justification of my memory and that of many other persons for whom i am deeply interested yet as we should not sink under any event i shall employ my leisure hours in setting down without form or order what occurs to my mind these fragments cannot supply what i have lost but they will serve to recal it to my memory and assist me in replacing it some future day if the power of doing it be left me         characters and anecdotes buzot of a losty character proud mind and boiling courage susceptible ardent melancholy and indolent cannot but sometimes run into extremes a passionate admirer of nature feeding his imagination with all the charms it offers and his mind with the most affecting principles of philosophy he seems formed to taste and impart domestic happiness he would forget the whole world in the placid enjoyment of private virtues with a heart worthy of his own but thrown into public life he is sensible only to the laws of rigid equity and defends them at all hazards easily roused to indignation against injustice he attacks it with ardour and is incapable of making terms with guilt the friend of human nature susceptible of the tenderest feelings capable of the sublimest flights and most generous resolutions he cherishes mankind and can sacrifice himself as a true republican but a severe judge of individuals and difficult in the choice of the objects of his esteem he bestows it on very few this reserve added to the energetic freedom with which he expresses himself has made him be accused of haughtiness and begotten him enemies mediocrity     scarcely ever forgives merit but vice detests and persecutes that courageous virtue which declares war against it buzot is the gentlest man on earth to his friends and the roughest adversary to knaves whilst yet young the ripeness of his judgment and purity of his morals obtained him the esteem and confidence of his fellowcitizens both their confidence and esteem he justified by his devotion to truth and his firmness and perseverance in speaking it ordinary men who depreciate what they cannot attain treat his penetration as resvery his warmth as passion his strong ideas as flights of fancy and his opposition to every kind of excess as a revolt against the majority he was accused of royalism because he asserted that morals were necessary in a republic and that nothing should be omitted to maintain or correct them of calumniating paris because he abhorred the massacres of september and ascribed them solely to a handful of cut throats hired by robbers of aristocracy because he would have called the people to the exercise of its sovereignty in passing judgment on lewis xvi of federalism because he claimed the maintenance of equality between all the departments and stood up to oppose the municipal tyranny of an usurping commune these were his crimes he had also his faults possessing a nobleness of countenance and elegance of shape in his dress he preserved that attention neatness and decorum which announce a love of order a taste and feeling of propriety and that respect which a man of education lhomme honnête owes to the public and to himself thus when the scum of the nation lifted to the     helm men who made patriotism consist in flattering the people in order to guide it in overturning and invading every thing to procure themselves wealth and consequence in slandering the laws to obtain rule in protecting licentiousness to secure impunity in cutting throats to strengthen their own power and in swearing drinking and dressing like porters to fraternise with their fellows buzot professed the morals of a socrates and retained the politeness of a scipio—what a villain—hence the upright lacroix the sage chabot the gentle lindet the modest thuriot the learned duroi the humane danton and their faithful imitators declared him a traitor to his country they caused his house to be razed and his property to be confiscated as formerly aristides was banished and phocion condemned to die i am astonished they did not decree that his name should be forgotten it would have been more consistent with their views than to pretend to preserve it attached to epithets which the evidence of facts disproves they cannot obliterate from the page of history buzots conduct in the constituent assembly or suppress his sage motions and vigorous flights in the convention however his opinions may be falsified in papers devoid of impartiality the principles by which they are supported will still be perceptible buzot frequently spoke offhand and this constituted the greater part of his labours but he never failed to stand up against every crooked system against every step detrimental to liberty his report on a departmentary guard a project so much decried contains arguments that have never been answered that against     instigators to murder displays the soundest policy and philosophy true as that nature strong as that reason on which it is founded his proposal for the banishment of the bourbons is detailed with precision defended with justice and written with warmth and elegance his opinion on the judgment of the king abounding with facts and arguments has nothing of that pathos and rambling from the subject in which so many haranguers indulged on the occasion in fine his letters to his constituents of the  th and   d of january paint his mind with such truth as will make them sought after a few wrestlers of his strength might have given the convention the impulse it wanted but the rest of the men of talents keeping themselves back as orators for great occasions were too neglectful of common daily contests and not sufficiently wary of the arts of their inferiour adversaries pétion a truly honest and good man he is equally incapable of doing the least thing repugnant to justice and inflicting the slightest injury or occasioning the least uneasiness to any one for himself he can neglect many things yet he knows not how to refuse a favour to any person in the world the serenity of a good conscience and mildness of an easy temper with frankness and cheerfulness distinguish his countenance he was a prudent mayor and faithful representative but he is too unsuspicious and too peaceable to foresee     or allay a storm sound judgment pure intentions and what is termed justness of thought characterise his opinions and writings which bear stronger marks of good sense than of talents as an orator he is cold as a writer his style is loose an equitable minister and a good citizen he was formed for the exercise of virtue in a republic not to found a republican government amongst a corrupt people who for some time idolized him and then rejoiced at his proscription as at that of an enemy at the time of the constituent assembly during the revision of the laws i was one day with the wife of buzot when her husband returned from the assembly very late bringing with him pétion to dinner it was the period when the court treated them as factious men and described them as intriguers completely occupied in exciting disturbances after dinner pétion sitting on a large sopha began to play with a little dog with all the earnestness of a child till they both grew tired and fell asleep together the conversation of four persons did not prevent pétion from snoring look at that sower of sedition said buzot with a smile we were eyed askance as we quitted the hall and our accusers greatly alarmed for their party imagine we are busily occupied in intrigue the circumstance and the remark have often recurred to my remembrance since those unfortunate times when pétion and buzot were accused and proscribed as royalists with as much reason as they were then accused of intrigue by the court always alone imbued with such principles conferring with men who professed the same only to converse on relative     opinions they deemed it sufficient to contend for justice obstinately to speak the truth constantly and to sacrifice themselves or expose themselves to every danger rather than betray them and they are declared traitors to their country i will here record a striking fact it has elsewhere been seen that during the first patriotic administration it had been settled that the minister of foreign affairs should take from the fund allotted to his department for secret services certain sums which he should put into the hands of the mayor of paris as well to maintain the police which was reduced to nothing for want of means as for publications to counterbalance those of the court dumouriez having quitted that department the matter that is as far as it regarded the police alone was mentioned to dabancourt he would do nothing in it himself but he pretended that it was a business which the king might be brought to approve as he could not fail to see its justice the king did not approve the proposal and answered in direct terms that he would not buy rods to whip himself in this he spoke sensibly enough as he was not sincerely a friend to the constitution and such an answer might have been expected but a few days after lacroix the present colleague of danton in concert with whom he is the plunderer of belgium the persecutor of honest men and the fovereign of the day who then had a seat in the legislative assembly and who was known to frequent the palace went to pétion to promise him the free disposal of three millions £   000 if he would employ them so as to support his majesty this proposal     must necessarily have been even more affronting to the mayor than the other was displeasing to the king it was rejected therefore notwithstanding he was received with particular graciousness at the same time by the king for his attendance being requested at the palace instead of finding the king surrounded as usual whom he had never before seen alone he was introduced into his closet where there appeared to be no one else and lewis xvi was lavish to him of marks of affability and regard and even of those little captivating cajoleries which he well knew how to employ when he pleased a slight sound of silk rustling behind the hangings informed pétion that the queen was present without being visible and the caresses of the king convinced him of his hypocrisy he remained firm without suffering his honesty to yield to the king who would have seduced it in the same manner as afterwards without flattering the people he would have deferred to it the judgment of that same king whilst lacroix who had served him and probably been paid for his services thought he could not too speedily be condemned to death pache it has been said with reason that the talent of knowing men ought to be the first with them who govern their errours of this kind are always the most fatal but the exercise of this difficult talent is much   0 more difficult in the time of a revolution and there is a degree of hypocrisy by which to be duped is no shame for to suspect it would prove it a man wicked in my youth i had met at the house of one of my relations gilbert who held a place in the postoffice an honest man an affectionate father he amused himself with painting cultivated music possessed that degree of suavity which is the usual companion of a taste for the fine arts and rendered himself esteemed by his acquaintance for his probity gibert was extremely attached to a man his most particular friend whose extraordinary merit he extolled with the height of enthusiasm and the modesty of one who thought himself far inferiour i sometimes saw this friend in whom at the first view you would perceive nothing but extreme simplicity i had however no opportunity of forming a judgment of him for i met him seldom and did not often see gibert himself from the latter i only learnt that his friend who was pache enamoured of a country life the only one suited to his patriarchal manners and of liberty all the advantages of which his understanding enabled him duly to prize resigned a genteel place under the french government to settle with his family in switzerland i afterwards learnt that having lost his wife finding his children sigh after paris and perceiving the revolution about to effectuate the liberty of the nation he resolved to return to the capital and that being satisfied with the independence he enjoyed from the sale of his former property and the purchase of a national     estate he had resigned into the hands of a quondam minister a pension that he had procured him it was not necessary to be often in the company of gibert and know his intimacy with pache to be informed of every thing that could be said to paches advantage in the month of january      he introduced him to us and i saw him from time to time pache as i have already observed wears an appearance of the utmost modesty it is so great indeed that you would be tempted to adopt the opinion he appears to have of himself and conceive him to be nothing extraordinary but this modesty you would set down to the account of his virtues when you discovered him reasoning justly and by no means destitute of acquirements as he is extremely reserved and never unbosoms himself freely you would soon suspect him to know more than he says and end with ascribing to him so much the more merit as you had been near committing the injustice of allowing him none a person who talks little listens intelligently to every subject that may be discussed and ventures a few welltimed observations easily passes for an able man pache was connected with meuniers and monge both members of the academy of sciences they had formed a popular society in the section of luxembourg the objects of which they said were knowledge and civism pache was very assiduous in this society and appeared to dedicate to his country as a citizen all the time he did not bestow on his children and which intervened between the lectures of the public courses to which he led them     i have elsewhere related how roland was called to the ministry at the end of march in that year the offices were filled with clerks of the old stamp little disposed to favour the new system but they were habituated to the course of business and it would have been wrong to hazard unhinging the whole of a great machine in those troublesome times for the sake of changing these agents all that ought to be done therefore was to watch over them and prepare to remove them in due time but in the multiplicity of business the daily current of which hurries along a man in place with inconceivable rapidity it is not to be denied that he may easily be involved in difficulties if he pay not a scrupulous attention to every thing which is infinitely irksome when it is inspired by mistrust in this situation roland was desirous of a man on whom he could depend to have always about him in his closet capable of reading over a letter or a report on some pressing subject which another still more pressing would not permit himself to read over so soon not to adjust it but to see that the adverse principles of the clerks had not influenced the manner of representing facts or studying motives and that could be employed to search out a particular paper in a particular office or deliver a verbal message on any thing of importance the idea of pache occurred pache had been in the navyoffice he knew the practice of business he had good sense patriotism morals that do honour to the choice of a man to an office and that simplicity which never excites illwill the idea appeared excellent it was mentioned to pache who immediately expressed the     greatest eagerness to serve roland in being useful to the state but on condition of preserving his independence without having either title or salary this was a noble commencement roland supposed that when a new arrangement took place in the office it would be easy to see for what he was more particularly adapted and pache came to him being in his closet every morning at seven with his morsel of bread in his pocket and remaining till three without ever being prevailed on to take any thing attentive prudent zealous executing his office well making an observation putting in a word to bring a subject to the point in question and soothing roland sometimes irritated by the aristocratical contrarieties of his clerks roland very irritable and warm to excess set an infinite value on the mildness and complaisance of pache and treated him as a valuable friend whilst i delighted with the service i supposed him to render my husband lavished on him marks of esteem and proofs of attachment pache had no style he could not be employed to compose a letter as he would have made it dry and flat but he was not wanted for this purpose and he was useful for that for which the attention of a trusty person was required our friend servan appointed minister at war was alarmed at the complication and derangement of certain offices and envied us pache let that honest man come to me said he to roland you have no farther occasion for him you are far superiour to your business and the chaos of the first outset once put in order you no longer need the superintendance of another whilst i     am overwhelmed with business and have a great hatred of persons in whom i can trust—these ministers thought too that places required capacities in those who filled them and that a man could not be put into an office without reasonable grounds to suppose him qualified for it roland gave his consent pache being consulted yielded with a good grace on the same conditions as he had made with roland after this removal we scarcely ever saw him but servan commended him highly a change in the ministry took place roland retired to private life and pache returned to his section the tenth of august came and the legislative assembly recalled the patriotic ministers roland arranged his offices pache persisted in refusing any place and roland gave a situation to fépoul whom pache had introduced to him fépoul was an intelligent industrious and accurate man very well calculated for superintending the accounts adroit never opposing any one and approving the stronger party roland nominated to the convention and disgusted by the horrours of september would have given in his resignation as minister and knowing the extreme embarrassment prudent men would have found in appointing him a successor he thought he should render the public service by mentioning pache this he did with the frankness of his character and the incaution of a susceptible mind proud of acknowledging merit wherever he supposes it to reside pache to whom he had not hinted his intention and who had a little before refused the superintendance of the jeweloffice for which he recommended restout     whom roland appointed in consequence appeared well satisfied to remain disengaged yet he accepted a mission for toulon from monge repaired thither and played some foolish tricks as i have since been informed servans health obliging him to quit the waroffice roland recommended to succeed him a person of whose principles there could be no suspicion and who was not destitute of talents he was accordingly approved and we wrote to pache to inform him of his appointment pressing him to accept it but this did not appear to be necessary for jealous as he was of his independence he appeared not to have the least uneasiness about the burden to be laid on his shoulders and took it without hesitation on his return to paris he came to see us we conversed with him freely on the dispositions of peoples minds the party formed by the parisian deputies the enormities of the commune the dangers that appeared to threaten the liberty of the convention and particularly those which might arise from the sway of immoral and guilty men who sought to acquire power only to escape punishment or gratify their passions of the establishment of order in his department and of our joy at seeing him in the council where his presence would preserve unanimity of will and concurrency of action pache listened to the overflowings of confidence with the silence of a man who disguises his own sentiments opposed every opinion of roland at the counciltable and came to see him no more at first we imagined that this conduct arose from a movement of selflove a sort of fear of appearing     the creature of roland but i learnt that this man who never accepted the invitations of his colleague under pretence of the retirement in which the multiplicity of his business obliged him to live received at his table fabre chabot and other mountaineers surrounded himself with their friends and took into office their creatures all of them actors of the lowest class ignorant persons or intriguers like themselves and that honest men began to murmur and lament i thought it right to attempt one final step to open his eyes if he were only misled and to detect him if he were insincere i wrote to him on the   th of november in a friendly style to acquaint him with the murmurs raised against him the causes to which they were owing and what his own interest seemed to require i reminded him of what had been said to him in confidence on his arrival at the ministry and i said a word or two of the unequivocal sentiments we had expressed to him the unanimity they gave reason to hope and the state of things altogether opposite to what might have been expected pache made me not the least answer and we soon heard that his first clerks hassenfratz vincent and the rest inconsiderable beings whom i would not name had not their enormities already consigned their names to the historic page amidst the late popular commotions declaimed at the jacobins and elsewhere against roland and held him up for an enemy of the people thus there could no longer be any room to doubt that pache sought his downfal the atrocity and baseness of this conduct inspired me with indignation and contempt sentiments in which i     preceded several who knew pache from us and who were then inclined to charge me with levity though they have since gone beyond me in aversion to him his misconduct or at least the way in which the public money was squandered in the wardepartment during his ministry was horrible every thing was unhinged owing to the bad choice of persons employed it was proved that regiments reduced to a small number of men were paid as if complete it was not only impossible to produce a fair account but even to make out any account at all for more than   0 millions near five millions and half sterling in the twentyfour hours following his dismission which so many ills rendered indispensable he nominated to sixty places all the acquaintances he had left base enough to make their court to him from his soninlaw who from a curate was made commissarygeneral with a salary of   000 livres £     to his hairdresser a boy of nineteen appointed a mustermaster these are the exploits which the people of paris rewarded by calling him to the mayoralty where supported by the chautnets heberts and other tatterdemalions he favoured the oppression of the legislative body the violation of the national representation and the proscription of all virtuous men and confirmed the ruin of his country and this was the man who fought a free country gave up a pension and refused a place but pache went into switzerland his native country and thus enabled his father to keep up at paris the port of a great man where he hoped to spend his time more agreeably than in a place which would have recalled to him his origin and pache received from castries a     pension which showed how far he had been a dependent on him and might have excited suspicion when the nobles and ministers of the old system were objects of persecution this side of him i had never seen and this is no way inconsistent with pache returning to france after the taking of the bastille courting votes in a little popular society ably contrived for the acquisition of influence obstinately refusing secondrate places and not hesitating a moment to become a member of the council and take upon himself that department in the administration which circumstances rendered most important he was in politics the tartuffe of moliere whilst i am writing this biron is confined in the same prison as i inhabit towards the end of paches ministry biron came to impeach him before the assembly and of course provided with documents capable of proving his misconduct biron saw him was seduced by his air of simplicity persuaded himself that his maleadministration was owing more to want of knowledge than dishonesty thought it cruel to bring to the scaffold a man who might have been imposed upon relinquished his design and then mentioned it to pache himself pache came to an explanation drew from biron all his papers and every information respecting the complaints against himself and procured him to be sent to the army of italy where he was left in want of every thing biron obtained some advantages they were never mentioned he made complaints no attention was     paid to them time ran on the evils increased he was urgent an order was sent him to repair to paris as soon as he arrived he was seized and confined at stpelagie in this stroke he discovers the hand of pache and the tyrant by whom he is oppressed gironde guadet and gensonné love each other probably because they bear no resemblance guadet is as impetuous as gensonné is cool but the paroxysms of his ebullient vivacity are never followed by sourness and to the intention of offending he is a stranger nature has made guadet an orator gensonné a logician this frequently loses in deliberating the time which ought to have been employed in action that dissipates in happy but short and transient flights the warmth which sometimes requires concentration always longer continuance to produce a durable effect guadet has had brilliant moments in each of the two assemblies the legislative and conventional owing to the sway of honesty seconded by talents but too susceptible to wrestle long without fatigue he has acquired the hatred of the wicked without being very formidable to them and he has never possessed the degree of influence which his enemies were fond of ascribing to him in order to render him an object of   0 jealousy gensonné useful in debate which however he has the fault of drawing out too long has laboured in different committees and drew up part of the plan of the proposed constitution his speech on the business of the king is seasoned with sarcastic strokes to which an apparent coolness gave an edge and which the sons of the mountain will never forgive both tender husbands good fathers excellent citizens virtuous men sincere republicans they sunk under the accusation of the conspirators merely for want of having formed an union in favour of the good cause for which alone they contended for which alone they were worthy to exist vergniaux was perhaps the most eloquent orator in the assembly he did not speak without any preparation like guadet but his made speeches strong in argument animated with fire abundant in matter sparkling with beauties and supported by a dignified delivery are still to be read with great pleasure yet i do not love vergniaux i perceive in him a philosopher absorbed in self disdaining mankind assuredly because he knows it well he gives himself no concern on its account but he who does this should remain a private individual without employment otherwise idleness is a crime and in this respect vergniaux is highly culpable what pity that     talents like his have not been employed with the ardour of a mind devoured by the love of the public weal and with the perseverance of an industrious mind grangeneuve is the best of mankind with a countenance of the least pronise his understanding is of the common level his mind truly great and he performs noble actions with simplicity and not in the least suspecting what they would cost any other than himself in the course of july      the conduct and disposition of the court indicating hostile designs every one talked of the means of preventing or frustrating them on this subject chabot said with the ardour which proceeds from a heated imagination not from strength of mind it was to be wished that the court might attempt the lives of some of the patriotic deputies as this would infallibly cause an insurrection of the people the only mean of setting the multitude in motion and producing a salutary crisis he grew warm on this head on which he made a copious harangue grangeneuve who had listened to him without saying a word in the little society where the discourse took place embraced the first opportunity of speaking to chabot in private i have been struck with your reasons said he they are excellent but the court is too sagacious ever to afford us such an expedient we must make it ourselves find     you men to strike the blow i will devote myself as the victim—what you will     —certainly what is there so strange in it my life is of no great utility as an individual i am of little importance i should be very happy to sacrifice myself for my country—ah my friend you shall not do it singly exclaimed chabot with a look of enthusiasm i will share the glory with you—as you please one is enough two may be better but there will be no glory in the business for it is necessary that it remain a secret to all the world let us think then of the means of carrying it into execution chabot took upon himself this charge a few days after he informed grangeneuve that he had found instruments for the purpose and all was ready—very well let us appoint the time we shall be at the committee tomorrow evening i will leave it at half after ten we must go through some street little frequented in which you must post your men they must take care to shoot us dead at once and not maim us only—the hour was fixed the circumstances were settled grangeneuve went to make his will and arrange some domestic concerns without any bustle and was punctual to the appointment chabot did not yet appear the hour came and he did not arrive grangeneuve concluded that he had given up his design of taking a share in the business but supposing that it would be carried into execution on himself he departed took the road agreed on traversed it slowly met no person repassed it a second time for fear of any mistake and was obliged to return home safe and found dissatisfied with having     made all his preparations in vain chabot framed some paltry excuses to prevent grangeneuve from upbraiding him and fully displayed the poltronry of a priest with the hypocrisy of a capuchin barbaroux whose features no painter would disdain to copy for the head of an antinous active laborious frank and brave with all the vivacity of a young marseillese was destined to become a man of merit and a citizen as useful as enlightened enamoured of independence proud of the revolution pregnant with knowledge capable of assiduous attention habituated to application and sensible to glory he is one of those men whom a great politician would seek to attach to himself and who must shine with lustre in a happy republic but who would venture to say to what point premature injustice proscription and misfortune may repress such a mind and tarnish its good qualities moderate success would have animated barbaroux in his career because he loves fame and possesses every qualification necessary to procure him a very respectable reputation but love of pleasure is at hand and if it once take the place of glory from vexation at obstacles or disgust at miscarriage it will corrupt an excellent temper and lead it to betray its noble destination during the first time of rolands being in administration     i had an opportunity of seeing several letters from barbaroux addressed rather to the man than to the minister the object of which was to lead him to judge of the method most proper to be employed to keep in the right way ardent and irritable minds like those of the department of the mouths of the rhone roland a strict observer of the law and rigid as it knew but one language when charged with its execution the administrators had gone a little astray the minister had chidden them with severity and their minds were irritated on this occasion barbaroux wrote to roland to vindicate the purity of his countrymens intentions excuse their errours and convince roland that gentler methods would bring them back to a proper state of subordination with more promptitude and certainty these letters were dictated by the best intentions and consummate prudence when i saw their author i was astonished at his youth they had that effect of which they could not fail with an equitable man who sought only to do good roland relaxed his austerity assumed a more brotherly than ministerial tone brought back the marseillese to their duty and gave barbaroux his esteem after roland quitted the ministry we saw him more frequently his open disposition and ardent patriotism inspired us with confidence it was then that reasoning on the bad state of affairs and the apprehension of despotism in the north we formed the conditional project of a republic in the south—that will be our last stake said barbaroux with a smile but the marseillese here will prevent our being     reduced to it—from this speech and some others of a similar turn we conjectured that an insurrection was preparing but his confidence leading him no farther we asked no more towards the latter end of july barbaroux nearly discontinued his visits telling us at last that we must not judge of his sentiments towards us from a consideration of his absence which arose solely from a desire of preventing our being involved in any difficulty after the tenth of august he departed for marseilles and returned a deputy to the convention there he did his duty as a man of courage many of his printed speeches display excellent argumentation and considerable knowledge with respect to the regulation of commerce that on the supply of provision is next to the work of creuzelatouche the best of its kind but he would require some pains to become an orator the animated and affectionate barbaroux is attached to the delicate and susceptible buzot i would style them nysus and euryalus may they have a better fate than those two friends louvet more acute than barbaroux more gay than buzot and in goodness of heart equal to either is intimate with both but more particularly with buzot who serves as a link to bind him to barbaroux of whom buzots natural gravity renders him in some sort the mentor louvet with whom i became acquainted during the first     ministry of roland and whose agreeable society i always sought may sometimes like philopœmen well pay the interest of his indifferent appearance little slender shortsighted and negligent in dress he appears nothing to the vulgar who remark not the nobleness of his countenance and the fire which animates his eyes and features at the utterance of a grand truth a fine sentiment a sally of wit or delicate raillery his pleasing romances where the graces of imagination are combined with fluency of style the maxims of philosophy and the salt of criticism are known to all men of letters and persons of taste politics are indebted to him for more serious works the matter and manner of which depose equally in favour of his head and heart he has shown that his able hand can alternately jingle the bells of folly direct the graver of history and launch the thunders of eloquence it is impossible to unite more wit with less pretension and more simplicity bold as a lion simple as a child a man of feeling a good citizen and a vigorous writer he can make catiline tremble in the senate dine with the graces and sup with bachaumont his philippic or robespierride deserved to have been pronounced in a senate possessed of strength to do justice his conspiracy of the  0th of march is another piece of value to the history of the times his sentinel is a model for those bills to be posted up those daily instructions designed to impart just ideas of facts to a populace which it is meant to influence solely by reason to move only for the good of all and to inspire with the happysentiments that honour human     nature it forms an excellent contrast to those atrocious and disgusting papers the coarse style and filthy expressions of which are answerable to the sanguinary doctrine and impure falsehoods of which they are the commonsewer those audacious performances of calumny hired by dishonest intrigue to accomplish the ruin of public morals and by the aid of which the gentlest people in europe has seen its disposition perverted to such a degree that the peaceable parisians whose kindness of heart was held up as a pattern are become the rivals of those ferocious pretorian guards who sold their votes their lives and the empire to the best bidder let us dismiss these sad images and revert our attention to the observations on st justs report against the confined deputies by a society of girondines printed at caen the   th of july in it i discovered the style the acuteness and the gaiety of louvet it is reason in dishabille sporting with ridicule without derogating from her strength or dignity lazowski by birth a polander lazowski came to france no one knows how without fortune but under the protection of the duke of liancourt whether he were a relation of some person in his service or a dependent on him in any other way lazowski had been appointed inspector of manufactures one of those very inferiour offices of administration     which confer no authority the salaries of which were moderate to fulfil the duties of which it was sufficient to have honesty and to have deserved them and which therefore appeared adapted to any one or for which at least every one thought himself fit they were in the gift of the council at the presentation of the minister of the finances and subordinate to the superintendants of trade the persons who filled these posts were little magistrates with great pretensions who made themselves of some little consequence people having the goodness to credit them like many others on their own words and who in reality from the multitude of affairs that came before them had extensive connexions and gave audiences at which great lords sometimes took the trouble to be present lively enterprizing and passing himself off for a man of understanding lazowski had persuaded his patron that he ought not to remain a simple inspector of manufactures it is true that in order to find him employment an inspectorship had been created at soissons where there was scarcely any manufacture but of priests and scarcely any objects of inspection except nuns for it was a town of convents without trade and in which no business was carried on except in the absolute necessaries of life mr de liancourt who was excited to the advancement of his dependant by the usual vanity of courtiers engaged in it also from the honest simplicity of his nature he was pressing with the minister and particularly with the superintendants of commerce for the secondary agents are always the really effective men calonne     was comptrollergeneral he had an inventive mind ready at seizing ingenious ideas the creation of a travelling inspectorship was hinted this was no effort of genius such a place had already existed and its inutility had been evinced but its second creation was not without motive it afforded the means of obliging a person of consideration and the number of places carried as far as four gave it the air of an administrative operation without reckoning the advantage of three places remaining for savour and intrigue they were soon filled the inspectors had salaries of  000 livres £        a year they were to reside in paris four months of the twelve and travel over the provinces the remaining eight at the deaths of the inspectorgeneral they were to succeed to their places and they were allowed to solicit gratifications in proportion to the importance of their services it is true this sapped the foundations of an institution the spirit of which was excellent it took from the inspectors of the generalities the hope of arriving at the inspectorgeneralship by merit or seniority it discouraged them by sending into their respective departments men for the most part strangers to the business and it deprived the minister of the possibility of being wellinformed of the state of arts manufactures trade and in short all the objects of industry of which a much better account might be given by men settled in the several generalities for the purpose than by these birds of passage employed in traversing them all but the views of the old system reached not so far and who knows whether under   0 the new individuals have more extensive views and particularly more disinterested ones this happened in the spring of      when i was at paris on family affairs i heard talk of a change in the inspections and i learnt that the ambitious brisson had given up that of lyons for a travelling inspectorship and that it was conferred on a very young man i reflected that roland always longed to retire and intended to solicit leave as soon as he had finished his labours in the encyclopedia that he might go into his own country to forget paris and the meannesses to which a man must stoop who would obtain preferment refused to merit i thought it would be better for him to go to his native home with a place than without one and it occurred to me to solicit the exchange of that of amiens where we then were for that of lyons which would fix him in his own country this trifling favour i supposed would easily be granted to an old servant whose knowledge and character the superintendants of commerce dreaded enough to be pleased with his removal the commissions were already made out i urged my reasons with all the advantage a woman then had with people who piqued themselves on their politeness to these were objected the difficulties which i frankly appreciated at their due value and i obtained the change almost as soon as my husband was informed of the request i intended to make on that occasion i met lazowski in the office then a fine gentleman his hair well powdered dressed with great care strutting as he walked rounding his     shoulders and swelling out his chest in short giving himself those little airs of consequence which fools then took for claims to respect and men of sense ridiculed the constituent assembly having discarded the nobles and suppressed the inspectorships deprived lazowski of his place and patron not daring to hope for a pension which must have been reduced to a cipher considering the little time he had been employed and finding himself without a penny he turned patriot wore his hair about his ears became a bawler at a section and made himself a fansculotte when indeed he was really in danger of being forced to go without breeches young and vigorous with good lungs and able at intrigue he was soop distinguished and became a wardcaptain capitaine de quartier in the national guard in this quality he served on the  0th of august and availed himself much of the dangers of that day like many others who mixed in the tumult to reap some profit and afterwards presented themselves boldly as the saviours of their country but his exploits date from the  d of september and the activity he continued to keep up in the section of finistere which was his in massacreing the priests at stfirmin he was of equal utility in the affair of the prisoners of orleans he had occasion to come as deputy of his section to the minister of the home department where i saw him and was enabled to judge of his astonishing transformation the pretty gentleman with his affected smiles had assumed the savage aspect of a furious     patriot the purple face of a drunkard and the haggard eye of an assassin dear to the jacobins who knew how to value his merit and destined him for something great he was intended to direct the conspiracy of the  0th of march but on a sudden he died at vaugirard of an inflammatory fever the fruit of debauchery bad hours and brandy all the world knows the grief of the band at this unexpected loss the funeral oration delivered by the highpriest robespierre his affecting lamentations and his pompous eulogium of the great man unknown the splendid funeral celebrated by the venerable commune and the holy societies the adoption of his child embraced in the townhall by papa pache and finally the interment of lazowski near the tree of liberty in the square of the carrouzel where his humble grave covered with turf is still to be seen let them who are astonished at his posthumous importance recollect that it emanated from the focus of the jacobins when they were become as formidable to the timid parisians as atrocious when marat was in all his glory and danton in all his power assuredly the people that takes the one for its lord the other for its prophet may well honour lazowski as a saint or a hero which are both the same thing in the religion of the septembrists     robert what have you done to robert said a person to me lately his wife and he revile you more virulently than any of your enemies—i have visited them but seldom i have done them service but i have not consented to slatter their ambition that is all when i departed from lyons for paris in      champagneux asked me whether i knew madam robert a woman of sense an author and a patriot—no i understand that mademoiselle keralio whose father is a writer has lately married m robert and that together they compose the mercure national of which i have seen a few numbers i know nothing more of her—do you with to see her if you do i will give you a letter of introduction to her for we are connected as writers journalistes—why truly a woman of sense an author and a republican it is enough to excite my curiosity give me a letter i arrived at paris i had been there about six weeks when one of our friends speaking to me of madam robert whom he had had occasion to see brought to my remembrance that i had a letter for her i told him of it he offered to accompany me to the house and we went i saw a little lively woman quick and haughty who gave me a very pleasing reception and i found her clumsy husband with a face like a bishop broad beaming health and selfcomplacency the ruddiness     of which no deep study had faded they returned my visit and i urged our acquaintance no farther the   th of july coming from the jacobins where i had been witness to the agitation produced by the mournful events of the champdemars when i arrived at home at eleven at night i found there m and madam robert—we come said the wife to me with the confidence of an old friend to intreat of you an asylum there is no necessity for having seen you often to be persuaded of your frankness and patriotism my husband drew up the petition on the altar of our country i was by his side we have escaped the slaughter and dare not retire to our own house or that of any known friend which may be searched for us—i am much obliged to you replied i for having thought of me on such an occasion and i am happy to receive them who are persecuted but you will be badly concealed here i was at the british hotel in guénégaud street this house is much frequented and the master of the house is a great partisan of lafayette—it is only for this night tomorrow we will bethink ourselves of some retreat i sent to inform the mistress of the hotel that a relation of mine just arrived at paris in this state of tumult had left her baggage at the place where the diligence put up and would pass the night with me and therefore begged she would make up a couple of camp beds in my apartment these were placed in a salon and in them our husbands slept whilst madame robert slept in my husbands bed adjoining mine in my own chamber the next morning i rose early and was eager to write letters to inform     my distant friends of the events of the preceding evening m and madam robert who i supposed must be very active and have a much more extensive correspondence as journalists dressed themselves leisurely chatted after the breakfast i had served up to them and placed themselves in the balcony facing the street they even went so far as to call out of the window to an acquaintance who passed by to come up to them this conduct appeared to me very inconsistent for people who were hiding themselves the person whom they called in conversed with them warmly on the events of the day before boasting that he had run his sword through the body of a national guard and talking very loudly though the room was adjoining to a large antichamber common to my apartment and another i called madam robert—i received you madam with that interest which justice and humanity feel for honest persons in danger but i cannot give an asylum to all your acquaintance you expose yourself by conversing as you do in a house like this with a person so indiscreet i am continually visited by deputies who would run the hazard of being brought into trouble if they were seen to enter my doors when there is a person here who boasts of having yesterday committed acts of violence i beg you will desire him to withdraw—madam robert called her husband i repeated my observations in a somewhat higher tone supposing the thicker head required the stronger impression the man was dismissed i found his name was vachard that he was president of a     society called paupers and much was boasted of his excellent qualities and ardent patriotism i sighed within myself at the price it was necessary to attach to the patriotism of a person who had every appearance of what is termed a wrong head and whom i should have taken for a man with a bad heart since i have learnt he was a hawker of marats paper who could not even read and who is now an administrator of the department of paris where he makes a very good figure amongst his fellows at noon m and madam robert talked of going home where every thing must be in confusion i told them as that was the case if they would accept of a dinner with me before they went i would order it early they replied they would rather return and thus engaged themselves as they were going in effect before three oclock they returned they were dressed the wife had long plumes and plenty of rouge the husband was equipped in skyblue silk with which his black hair falling down in large curls formed a singular contrast and a long sword by his side added every thing to his dress that could make him remarkable—my god said i to myself are these people mad and i listened to their discourse to satisfy myself that their brains were not turned the jolly robert ate wonderfully and his wife prattled as freely at length they took leave and i never saw them after or spoke of them to any one on our return to paris the following winter robert meeting roland at the jacobins made him some civil reproaches or polite complaints for the interruption of our acquaintance and his wife visited me     several times inviting me in the most pressing manner to go to her house two days in the week when she received company where i should find men of merit belonging to the legislature i did go once there i saw antoine whose mediocrity i knew a little man well enough to place on a toilette a pretty maker of verses an agreeable writer of trifles but destitute of any decided character i saw some other patriotic deputies of the standard as observant of decorum as chabot and a few women ardent in civism with some honourable members of the fraternal society completed a circle which suited me little and to which i never returned a few months after roland was called to the ministry fourand twenty hours had scarcely passed after his nomination when madam robert came to visit me—so your husband is in place patriots ought mutually to serve each other i hope your husband will not forget mine—i should be happy madam to render you any service but i do not know how it is in my power and certainly m roland will neglect no opportunity of serving the public by employing persons of capacity in four days time madam robert returned to pay me a morning visit and in a few days after another always insisting much on the necessity of putting her husband in some office and his claim to one on account of his patriotism i informed madam robert that the minister of the homedepartment had no places in his appointment except those in his own offices which were all filled that notwithstanding the advantage which might accrue from changing some of his agents it behoved a prudent     man to study things and persons before he made alterations lest the course of affair should be clogged and besides from what she had said to me herself her husband certainly did not desire a clerks place—certainly robert is qualified for something better than that—in such a case the minister of the homedepartment can do nothing to serve you—but he should speak to the minister of foreign affairs and get some mission for robert—i believe it suits not the strictness of m rolands principles to solicit any one or to interfere in the departments of his colleagues but as you probably mean nothing more than the bearing testimony to your husbands civism i will mention it to mine madam robert laid close siege to dumouriez and brissot and three weeks after she returned to tell me that the former had given her a promise which she begged me to recall to his memory when i should see him that same week he dined with me brissot and some others were present—have you not promised a certain very pressing lady said i to dumouriez to give her husband a place without delay she has requested me to remind you of it and her activity is so great that i shall not be sorry to have it in my power to quiet her with respect to myself by telling her that i have done as she desired—is it not robert of whom you speak asked brissot immediately—it is—aye resumed he addressing himself to dumouriez with his characteristic simplicity you ought to put that man in a place he is a sincere friend of the revolution a warm patriot and not very happily     circumstanced the reign of liberty ought to be beneficial to its friends—what said dumouriez interrupting him with equal gaiety and quickness do you speak of that little blackheaded man as thick as he is long faith i have no wish to disgrace myself i would not send such a hobnail to any place—but replied brissot among the agents you have to employ all do not require equal capacity—do you know this robert asked dumouriez—i am well acquainted with keralio his wifes father a very respectable man at his house i have seen robert i know he is charged with some defects but i believe him to be honest possessing an excellent heart imbued with the true spirit of civism and in want of employment—i cannot employ such a madman—but have you not promised his wife—certainly an inferiour place with a salary of a thousand crowns which she refused do you know what she asks the embassy to constantinople—the embassy to constantinople exclaimed brissot laughing impossible—it is the fact—i have nothing more to say—or i added dumouriez except that i will order that hogshead to be tumbled into the street if he come to me and forbid my door to his wife madam robert returned to my house again i wished to get rid of her altogether but without noise and i could employ no method inconsistent with my natural frankness she complained greatly of dumouriez for his tardiness i told her that i had spoken to him and i ought not to conceal from her that she had enemies who propagated ill reports concerning her and i would advise her to trace them   0 to their source in order to stop them that a man in a public capacity might not be exposed to the detraction of the malevolent for employing a person against whom there must necessarily be unfavourable prejudices and this required nothing more than certain explanations which i recommended to her to give madam robert repaired to brissot who ingenuously told her that she was mad to ask an ambassadors appointment and a person who made such pretensions would ultimately obtain nothing we saw her no more but her husband wrote a pamphlet against brissot to denounce him as a distributor of places and a deceiver who had promised him the embassy to constantinople and then forfeited his word he flung himself into the cordeliers connected himself with danton submitted to be his clerk when danton became minister on the  0th of august was pushed up by him to the electoral body and the deputation from paris to the convention payed his debts lived expensively gave entertainments to dorleans and a thousand others is now rich calumniates roland and reviles his wife all this is easily conceivable he follows his trade and gets money champfort and carra champfort a man of letters living in the world familiar with the great of the ancient school connected with men of talents who have made some     figure in the revolution has become better acquainted with the court and the city characters and intrigues politics and men than with the age in which he lives that extreme confidence with which i have always reproached those philosophers who were active in the new order of things champfort partook he could not credit the ascendancy of some perverse heads and the confusion they would be capable of producing—you carry things to an extreme he would say to me sometimes because placed in the centre of the movement you suppose its sphere of action extensive it appears to you animated and you deem it formidable these fellows will ruin themselves by their own intemperances they will not be able to impress a retrograde course on the light of eighteen centuries—yet these fellows rule and champfort is now a prisoner with all those who do not worship their empire abundance of wit a sufficiency of morality the graces of good breeding the acquirements of literature and the philosophy of a sound and cultivated mind rendered champforts conversation equally solid and entertaining at first i thought he talked too much and i accused him of that exuberance of speech and that sort of superiority which our men of letters very commonly take upon them i liked him better in a select society of five or six persons than in a mixed company of fifteen or twenty of which i had to do the honours but to say the truth i forgave him for speaking more than another for he amused me more he abounds in those happy sallies which     make you laugh and afford you matter for reflection at the same time and which are very rare—do you think champfort a thoroughly sincere patriot said to me one day a man of spartan austerity—let us not misunderstand one another replied i champfort sees clearly and judges rightly he has a sound head and does not err with regard to principles he understands and reveres those of public freedom and human happiness and will not betray them but that he would sacrifice to them his peace his enjoyments and his life is another question on which i believe he would deliberate—you see plainly then he is not a virtuous man—why he is virtuous as ninna was chaste and amidst the corruption which erodes our vitals we should be happy if we had many such virtuous men—our hypocrites and enthusiasts would never admit that men should be employed according to the compound ratio of their civism and talents so that they should be interested in employing these to the advantage of that i have seen servan enraged that excellent engineers whom he employed in the camp near paris were rejected under pretence of their not being ardent republicans whilst stout patriots but consummate blockheads who did not know how to draw a line were substituted in their room—i would not send for them said he very justly to give their opinions on the form of a government but i am convinced they will serve him well who knows how to employ them we want redoubts not motions—this was too reasonable it was talking like the faction of statesmen and thus men of wisdom acquired the title of conspirators     when roland was recalled to the ministry on the  0th of august it was necessary to change the superiour of the national library at that time one dormesson whose name was obnoxious to the new system and whose mediocrity gave no room for regret the minister of the home department thought of dividing the function of librarian between two persons reducing the salary from twelve thousand livres £ 00 a year to eight £     s  d and having the library open every day thus the public would have gained on the score of instruction the nation on that of œconomy and the government by the employment of two useful subjects with regard to the choice of persons he fixed on champfort who being a man of letters and a philosopher was one of those of that class who had openly declared themselves for the revolution and on carra already employed in the library whose extreme zeal if not his talents seemed to entitle him to this reward he had never seen either of the men and was determined solely by these considerations added to the necessity of making a choice agreeable to the public i received the visits of both these men in consequence of their places and the connexion they gave them with the minister and i should have continued to see champfort with pleasure if circumstances had not kept us at a distance carra become a deputy has appeared to me a very good man with a very indifferent head it is impossible for a man to be more enthusiastic in favour of the revolution liberty and a commonwealth or a worse judge of men and things giving way entirely to his imagination reckoning from it rather than from facts arranging in his     mind the interests of foreign powers as best suited our success seeing every thing strewed with flowers he dreamed of his countrys happiness and the emancipation of all europe with inexpressible complacency it must not be denied that he contributed greatly to our political commotions and to the insurrections of which the object was the overthrow of tyranny his annals succeeded wonderfully with the populace from a certain prophetic cast which always has weight with the vulgar and when we behold such a man brought to trial as a traitor to the republic we are tempted to ask whether robespierre be not labouring in the service of austria yet it is very evident that he labours for himself and that in his greedy ambition to pass for the sole deliverer of france he would remove out of the way all who have in any manner served their country with a sort of noise or reputation doratcubiéres is a name i had so often seen in the almanac of the muses and similar compilations that i could not avoid laughing when i found joined to it the title of secretaryregister of the municipality they seem incongruous and so they really are cubières faithful to that double character of insolence and baseness which his revolting features wear in a supreme degree preaches sansculotism as he sung the graces makes verses to marat as he did to iris and sanguinary without     rage as he was apparently amorous without tenderness he prostrates himself humbly before the idol of the day be it venus or tantalus provided he creep through life and get bread what matters it how yesterday it was by writing a song today it is by copying a report or signing an order of the police getting admission into my house i know not how when my husband was minister i knew him only as a wit and i had an opportunity of making him a present he dined with me twice the first time i thought him odd the second insupportable a flat courtier an insipid complimenter consequentially stupid and meanly polite he astonishes good sense and offends reason more than any other being i ever saw i soon felt the necessity of giving my open manner that air of solemnity which hints to a person of whom you would get rid what he has to do cubières understood it yet after some time he wrote to me to beg permission to introduce to me a prince who was desirous of being admitted to my acquaintance the stress he laid on this title of prince was completely laughable and to this he added the most disgusting flattery to myself i answered in the manner of which i am sufficiently capable when i would call people to order without enraging them and make a jest of them without giving them a right to complain as to the prince and his introduction i contented myself with observing that in the retired life i led quite foreign to every thing that might be termed a circle and avoiding company i saw only such persons as business or ancient friendship led my husband sometimes to wish to meet at his table cubières replied with long excuses as tedious     as his eulogies requesting a single moment to explain himself at my feet i gave him no answer and thought no more of him till the day i was apprehended when i perceived his signature on the order of the commune for there were two one from the committee of insurrection of the said   st of may the other from the commune both were shown to me lest i should object to that of the committee yet this alone was used by my guards with the keeper of the abbey to which i was conveyed the request of cubières led me to suspect some private interest i diverted my husband at the time by relating to him what had passed and in fact i learnt that the prince of salmkirbourg the person in question was then importuning the ministers in order to obtain from the council an indemnification for i know not what possessions in alsace hence i concluded i had guessed aright and that he sought to see me only from an idea that the new system might resemble the old when women were engaged to plead with their husbands i was pleased with what i had done and found in this anecdote a fresh trait of the character of cubières it would be serving him properly to publish his servile letters as contrasts to his affectation of ingenuousness and freedom i should have had some curious pieces of that sort if i had preserved the farrago how many relations and admirers of whom i had never before heard sprung up on a sudden as soon as i was the wife of a minister—as i admitted no company they wrote to me i had enough to do to read their letters which i answered briefly and politely but sincerely to suppress every thought that i     either could or would interfere in any thing and to convince them of the perfect inutility of paying me compliments or calling themselves relations the most curious circumstance is that some were angry and replied in severe terms i remember one m david who had planned some establishment in behalf of which he would have interested me it availed me nothing to answer that he would obtain his purpose by applying directly to the minister that my interference would answer no end and that i never employed it as it would be making myself a judge of subjects to which i was incompetent he found my principles abominable and wrote to me with great anger thus in private i was persecuted for my perseverance in confining myself to my own sphere of duty and in public i was slandered by envy as having taken upon myself the direction of affairs yet people think it very pleasing and desirable to fill places of eminence—no doubt the wife of a good man devoted to the public who is proud of his virtues and feels herself capable of supporting his courage tastes some pleasure and enjoys some glory but they are not gratuitous and few would undergo what they cost without regretting their price anecdotes when i quitted the abbey i left there the family of desilles which was soon after removed to the conciergerie whence many concerned in the conspiracy     in brittany were conducted to the scaffold angelica desilles the wife of roland de la fouchais the similarity of whose name to mine occasioned one of my friends who wanted to carry me off to make some singular mistakes was one of the victims her sisters were acquitted and consequently ought to have been set at liberty but as a measure of general safety they were immediately arrested and conveyed to st pélagie where i saw them we sometimes conversed together they were both young mild and good the elder a widow of twentyseven wanted neither amiableness nor a decided character the younger was of a very delicate constitution at first overwhelmed with grief it appeared as if they must sink under it but both mothers of unfortunate children of the tenderest years they had to live for their sakes and summoned up all their courage they several times mentioned to me the base treachery of chestel a man of wit known at paris where he practises physic a breton by birth who had insinuated himself into the most intimate confidence of desilles the father knew his wishes and appeared to aid his schemes but connected at the same time with danton he received through his means commissions from the executive power repaired to britanny to pay his court to his friend taking up his abode at his country house feasted by his relations encouraging his designs and giving them fresh activity by his assistance the moment that appeared to him most sure he secretly informed against him and brought the parties concerned together that they might be seized desilles escaped all his family were apprehended     his effects were sealed up the places where his papers might be concealed which cheftel had pointed out were searched the young women who still thought him a friend to the family begged his advice and implicitly followed his directions embarrassed with a purse of two hundred louis intended for their father they put it into his hands ordered the best horse in their stable to be saddled and pressed cheftel to depart that he might not be taken he professed himself determined to share their fate indeed accompanied them but not as a prisoner and would always have persuaded the commander of the armed force charged with the conveyance of the prisoners to contrive that they should enter the great towns by day—surely you cannot mean any such thing said the commander it would endanger their lives they arrived at paris the trial commenced the name of cheftel was crased from the correspondence because he had disclosed the plot and the poor victims then discovered the serpent they had entertained tried acquitted yet confined and without money the two young women recollected the purse of louis they confided this circumstance to a man of courage and probity who went to cheftel and demanded the two hundred louis cheftel taken by surprise at first denied the fact but terrified at the firmness of the demander who threatened to expose him to the whole world he hesitatingly confessed the receipt of half that sum which he repaid in assignats though not till after repeated interviews cheftel formerly physician to madam elizabeth   0 assiduous in pursuit of fortune had in like manner gained the confidence of a wealthy private gentleman whose name was i think paganel or something like it and who amongst other possessions had immense estates in limousin paganel desirous of emigrating to shun the storms of the revolution made a fictitious sale of his property to cheftel he departed and reckoned upon the income which his faithful friend was to remit to him but cheftel kept it for himself and enjoys with danton the pleasures of an opulence which both have acquired by similar means at length repeated solicitations perhaps assisted by more valuable offers procured the two sisters their liberty i saw them depart but i did not know their secret on this head i have just seen castellane however quit this prison at the price of  0000 livres £   0 paid to chabot dillon got out of magdelonettes in the same manner both were involved in a charge of a counterrevolutionary plot this very moment august    i have under my eyes one miss briant living at no  0  st bennets cloister a woman of the town whose keeper is a forger of assignats an information has been lodged against him and a pursuit has been pretended to be set on foot but gold has rained into the hands of the administrators he who directs the persons appointed to discover and seize him knows where he is concealed his mistress is apprehended for forms sake the administrators who pretend to come and interrogate her bring her news of her keeper and they will soon be together at liberty as they have money to purchase it fouquaitainville public accuser to the revolutionary     tribunal notorious for his dissolute life and impudencein making out articles of impeachment without any cause is in the habit of receiving money from the parties madam rochechouart payed him  000 livres £     for mony the emigrant fouquaitainville pocketed the sum mony was executed and it was hinted to madam rochechouart that if she opened her mouth about the affair she should be instantly clapped into prison never more to behold the face of day is it possible the reader may exclaim—do you doubt it hear more in the hands of a late president of the department of the eure there are two letters from lacroix the deputy formerly judge siscal of amet one contains an engagement for five hundred thousand livres £ 0    for the purchase of national domains the other is to withdraw the engagement and assigns for his reason the decree which obliges deputies to justify any increase of their fortune since the revolution but this decree has been suffered to sleep since the troublesome twentytwo were expelled lacroix holds estates as well as danton after having pillaged like him lately a dutchman went to the commune of paris for a passport to return to his own country it was refused the dutchman made no complaint but seeing which way the wind blew he took out his pocketbook and placed an assignat of a hundred crowns on the desk this language was well understood and he received his passport here marat will be quoted to me at whose death according to the public papers no more than a single assignat of    fols  s 0d ½ was found in his house     what edifying poverty let us however examine his habitation borrowing the description of a lady her husband a member of the revolutionary tribunal is confined in the house of correction for differing in opinion from the rulers she has been put into st pélagie as a measure of safety it is said but probably because the active solicitations of this little woman from the south of france were dreaded born at toulouse she has all the vivacity of that ardent climate where she first saw the light and a few months ago she was disconsolate at the imprisonment of a cousin to whom she was tenderly attached she had given herself much pains to no purpose and knew not where farther to apply when she bethought herself of marat she knocked at his door and was told he was not at home but he heard a female voice and came out he had on boots without stockings an old pair of leather breeches and a white silk waistcoat his dirty shirt open at the bosom exhibited his skin of yellow hue long and dirty nails marked the ends of his fingers and his frightful visage was perfectly in unison with this strange dress he took the lady by the hand led her into a salon newly fitted up furnished with blue and white damask and decorated with silk curtains elegantly drawn up in festoons a splendid chandelier and superb vases of porcelain filled with natural flowers then scarce and of high price sat down by her side on a voluptuous sopha listened to her tale kissed her hand squeezed her knees a little and promised her that her cousin should be set at liberty—i would have let him even kiss my lips if he had pleased said the little woman gaily with her toulousan     accent but upon condition of washing them afterwards provided he restored to me my cousin—that very evening marat went to the committee and the next day her cousin left the abbey but ere four and twenty hours had passed the friend of the people wrote to the husband sending him a person who stood in need of a certain savour which he took care not to refuse one m dumas a natural philosopher by profession or a man of learning by trade presented himself before the famous committee of public safety some time in the month of june to make it some important proposals he offered to reconnoitre the army of the rebels in vendée and to give an exact account of its situation and numbers circumstances concerning which the utmost ignorance has prevailed since the commencement of the war m dumas pretended most accurately to inspect the whole by taking a birds eye view of it from a balloon—why indeed it is an ingenious thought said some of the profound politicians of the committee—yes replied citizen dumas and it may be quickly put into execution i know there is a balloon to be found with all its appendages in the hotel of an emigrant so that the nation need not be at the expense of the purchase—bravo he gives the necessary information it is received with transport and officially sent to the minister of the home department for him to find the balloon without delay the minister sets his people in motion they repair to the emigrants hotel which was an inn and the apartment he occupied was one small chamber where there remained not a single rag a     report was made in consequence the committee was disconsolate dumas was clamorous and a fresh injunction was issued to the minister to make a stricter search after the balloon on this the minister consults his secretary and it is resolved to have recourse to grand measures a letter is written to the department the department sends to the municipality and the municipality puts the affair into the hands of its magistrates of police here the business was lost to the public functionaries and i laughed heartily at the abbey with champagneux who wrote the ministerial letter at the charlatanry of the brazenfaced dumas the sottishness of the committee the complaisance of the minister and the whole category of follies but i found the clew of the history at st pélagie citizen jubert a magistrate of the police one of those who signed the contradictory orders for apprehending me and setting me at liberty a fat man with a hoarse voice a true sectionprater with a disgusting face and awkward gait discovered one miss lallement a tall pretty girl of fifteen kept by st croix an eminent officer in the service i think of philip dorleans she was taken up and sent to st pélagie in her apartment were found the cover of a balloon its net and other things belonging to it this was the very prize described by dumas but the committee had forgotten the expedient the philosopher had lost all hopes of making himself of consequence the minister cared little about the result of the orders he had given and the magistrates had no objection to     take into their own possession what was now a thing of some value jubert thought the little lallement handsome he had laid hands on several of her effects amongst which was a portrait of st croix and he deemed it very silly for her to pretend to be faithful to him at length imagining that kindness would render her more tractable he procured an order for her discharge came to fetch her in a carriage conducted her to her home where he ordered a dinner restored to her after much solicitation the portrait of st croix the eyes of which he had spoiled and expected a reward the young girl laughed at his expectations as she ridiculed his manner showed him the door and repaired to the policeoffice to upbraid him publicly with his attempts whilst she claimed the other effects that had been taken from her the adventure made some noise but the colleagues of jubert were not like to condemn it and she passed through many others still more disgusting or atrocious of which the legislators of the  d of june daily offer examples to all the constituted authorities citizenness roland august    august    today a misunderstanding has broken out between the tyrants hebert dissatisfied at not being appointed minister sets his father duchesne upon the makers attacks the enriched patriots names lacroix and is undermining danton danton more wicked than any one of them but more circumspect whilst he endeavours to keep some measures in the course of affairs is already styled a moderate man the committee     of public safety has rejected him robespierre moved by jealousy exclaims against him and the cordeliers and jacobins are on the point of coming to a rupture a grand spectacle for us victims is preparing the tigers are going to worry one another perhaps they will forget us unless the fury of their last moments impel them to exterminate all in their power before their own fall chabot is for transporting all suspected persons of course the wives of pétion and roland confined under that appellation are threatened with a voyage to cayenne a pleasant destination citizenness roland september    september    have not my ears deceived me—what that woman who lived unknown buried in the country arrived at paris solely to solicit for her daughter is condemned to die—how profoundly iniquitous such a condemnation pétion proscribed as a royalist exhibited a phenomenon of the late revolution his wife whom calumny had never reached had retired to fécamp amongst her own relations there to await happier days secluded from the world she went to the seaside with her son a pretty boy ten years of age the sole fruit of her marriage that he might bathe in the salt water she was taken up and made a prisoner with the child and both have been brought to paris and confined at st pélagie daily examples teach the wives of them who are proscribed to expect persecution and pétions has sufficient strength of reason to support her own misfortunes but the situation of her     son afflicts her it is equally detrimental to his health and his education she would make complaints yet how could she render them interesting and above all whom could she get to listen to them she wrote to her mother who lived at chartres to request her to make those solicitations to which her relationship gave her a sufficient title she came appeared at the bar presented her petition with tears was referred to the committee and waited upon all the deputies who composed it some of these seemed to give her hope but from the greater number she experienced a very unfavourable reception the inutility of her solicitations becoming evident she resolved to depart and repaired to her section to get her passport signed there she was impeached and apprehended she was carried before the mayor a man who resided in the hotel where she lodged deposed that she had said the french had need of a king two hired witnesses deserters belonging to liege attested it she was condemned to lose her head and is now going to the scaffold i have seen the unfortunate woman madam lefevre several times when she came to her daughter she was in her fifty seventh year she had been handsome and her face still showed that her features had been regular she had preserved a fine head of hair and her shape though far from slender was by no means clumsy the desire of pleasing had occupied the greater part of her life yet it had not led her to make any acquisitions nothing appeared in her therefore but the remains of her former pretensions and a fund of selfregard which was perceptible on     every occasion she had no political opinion indeed she was incapable of forming any for she could not reason two minutes together it is possible that in a conversation excited by some illdesigning people she may have said it would be indifferent to her if the french had a king provided they had peace or some words of a like nature may have been laid hold of in order to bring her to trial but who perceives not in this false and atrocious application of the law a scheme to mislead the people by making them suppose the family of pétion royalists and its persecution consequently just fearful days of the reign of tiberius we see your horrours revived but multiplied in proportion to the number of our tyrants and their favourites this unfortunate people whose morals are destroyed and disposition perverted requires blood and every thing except justice is employed to satisfy its demand i have seen in the prisons during the four months that i have been their inhabitant malefactors designedly forgotten and they are in haste to put to death madam lefevre who has committed no crime because she is guilty of being the stepmother of the honest pétion detested by tyrants i can conceive nothing more ridiculous than the quackery with which are vaunted the benefits of a constitution decreed with equal zeal and rapidity yet did not the very people who made it soon after decree that france was and remained in a state of revolution and what is the constitution but a nonentity since no part of it is observed of what advantage then is it to us to have such a thing it is     a piece of waste paper which serves only to attest the impudence of them who would make a merit of it without concerning themselves about securing to us its benefits they who in the multitude accepted it without examination merely through weakness and indolence from the hope of seeing peace which they would not take the pains to deserve are well rewarded for their apathy unfortunately it is with nations and their affairs as with individuals and their undertakings the folly and fears of the many produce the triumph of the bad and the ruin of the good posterity will assign to each his place but it is in the temple of memory themistocles died never the less in exile socrates in prison and sylla in his bed citizenness roland september    september    the decree that ordains the act of impeachment against brissot to be presented tomorrow was passed in the same sitting in which it was proposed to shorten the forms of trial before the revolutionary tribunal and in which the four sections of that tribunal were organised so that the means of trying are multiplied sentence is enjoined to be passed more speedily and the defence of the accused is curtailed at the same moment when it is resolved to destroy brissot and the rest of the imprisoned deputies that is to say those men of talents who might have confounded their accusers four months have passed without their being able to draw up that act of impeachment the formation of which has repeatedly been decreed in vain an   0 augmentation of power and the universal sway of terrour were necessary to enable them to sacrifice the founders of liberty but when the arbitrary imprisonment of a fourth part of france under the appellation of suspected persons has been determined after an imbecile people has been rendered fanatic to ruin lyons as if the second city in the republic belonged to the emperour and those whom it thinks proper to style muscadines were wild beasts after an iron sceptre stretched out over all france has established the reign of guilt and fear after it has been made a law for those who are accused to answer simply yes or no without saying any thing in their defence they may send to execution those guiltless victims whose eloquence they still dread so redoubtable does the voice of truth appear even to those who are sufficiently powerful not to listen to its commands what care is not taken to stifle this voice but history remains her hand still holds the graver and prepares silently though slowly to revenge the imitators of barnevelt and sidney citizenness roland october   october   i peruse the public papers and i perceive robespierre accuse roland and brissot of having spoken ill of daubigny who stole  00000 livres £     from the tuileries on the tenth of august after whom pursuit was made and whose wife in his absence brought the  00000l to the commune i see robespierre assert that roland appointed restout to the jeweloffice to pave the way for its being robbed     though it was pache whom roland chose who refused it and who presented restout to the minister and the hall of the convention resounded with the complaints of roland against the commander of the national guard for his neglect to strengthen the post at the jeweloffice in spite of the ministers repeated injunctions that robespierre whom once i thought an honest man is a very atrocious being how he lies to his own conscience how he delights in blood citizenness roland october    stpélagie infirmary of stpélagie october    within these solitary walls where oppressed innocence has now dwelt near five months with silent resignation a stranger appears—it is a physician brought by my keepers for their own tranquillity for to the ills of nature as to the injustice of man i neither can nor will oppose aught but calm fortitude when he heard my name he said he was the friend of a man whom i perhaps did not like—why do you think so who is he—robespierre—robespierre i have known him well and esteemed him much i have thought him a sincere and zealous friend of freedom—is he not so—i fear he loves power too perhaps from an idea that he knows how to do good as well as any man and wills it not less i fear he loves vengeance too much and particularly to exercise it against them by whom he supposes himself not admired i believe he is very susceptible of prejudice easily moved to passion in consequence too ready to think every one guilty who does not agree in all his opinions—you have not seen him twice—i have seen him much     oftener—ask him let him lay his hand on his heart and see whether he can speak any ill of me robespierre if i deceive myself i put it into your power to convince me that i am wrong to yourself i repeat what i have said of you and i will deliver to your friend a letter which perhaps my keeper will suffer to pass on account of him to whom it is addressed i write not to entreat you as you may suppose i have never yet entreated any one and certainly i shall not begin from a prison and to him who has me in his power prayer is for the guilty or the slave innocence testifies which is quite sufficient or complains to which she has a right when oppressed but even complaints suits not me i can suffer without being afraid of what may happen i know too that at the birth of republics revolutions almost inevitable unfolding the passions of mankind too much frequently expose them who best serve their country to become the victims of their own zeal and of the errours of their contemporaries their consciences will afford them consolation and history will be their avenger but from what singularity am i a woman incapable of any thing but wishes exposed to those storms which usually fall only on active persons and what fate is in reserve for me these are two questions which i address to you i deem them of small importance in themselves and with regard to myself personally for what is a single emmet more or less crushed by the foot of the elephant in the general system of the world but they are of infinite concern with regard to the present     liberty and future happiness of my country for if its declared friends and avowed defenders be confounded together with its confest enemies without distinction if the faithful citizen and generous patriot be treated in the same manner as the dangerous regarder of self and persidious aristocrate if the woman of sense and virtue who is proud of having a country and in her humble retirement or whatever her situation makes to it every sacrifice in her power find herself associated in punishment with the vain or haughty female who curses equality surely justice and freedom do not yet reign and future happiness is doubtful i speak not here of my venerable husband his accounts should have been examined when they were delivered in instead of refusing to justify him at first in order to accuse him after having envenomed the public mind against him by slander robespierre i defy you not to believe that roland is an honest man you may be of opinion that he does not think justly with respect to this measure or that but your conscience must secretly do homage to his integrity and civism he needs to be seen little to be thoroughly known his book is always open and it is intelligible to every one he has the ruggedness of virtue as cato had its tartness his manners have procured him as many enemies as his inflexible equity but these inequalities of surface disappear at a distance and the great qualities of the public man will remain for ever it has been reported that he fanned the flames of civil war at lyons and the reporters have dared to allege this pretext as the cause of my apprehension the     supposition was not more just than its consequence disgusted with public affairs irritated at persecution tired of the world sinking under the burden of his toils and his years he could do no more than groan in obscure retirement and bury himself in silence to spare the world a crime —he has corrupted the public mind and i am his accomplice—surely this is of all reproaches the most curious of all imputations the most absurd you robespierre cannot desire me to take the trouble of refuting them here the task would be too easy and you cannot be of the number of those good people who believe a thing because it is in print and because it has been told them the pretension of my being an accessary would be laughable were not the whole rendered atrocious by the cloudy aspect under which it is presented to the people who seeing nothing forms to its imagination some monstrous figure of it knows not what they must have an extreme thirst of injuring me who can hedge me thus with premeditated brutality into an accusation strongly resembling that charge of hightreason so often repeated under the reign of tiberius to destroy all whom guilty of no crime it was resolved to sacrifice whence then arises this animosity i cannot conceive i who never injured any one who know not how even to wish harm to them who injure me brought up in retirement educated in those serious studies which have unfolded my mind and enabled it to display some character addicted to simple enjoyments which no circumstances have prevailed to alter an enthusiastic admirer of the revolulution     and giving a loose to the energy of the generous sentiments it inspires remote from public transactions through principle as well as sex but conversing on them with warmth because the interests of the public become of all the first as soon as they exist i regarded the first calumnies vented against me as contemptible follies i deemed them the necessary tribute claimed by envy from a situation which the vulgar had still the imbecility to consider as exalted and to which i would have preferred the peaceful state in which i had spent so many happy days these calumnies however have increased with effrontery proportionate to my serenity and exemption from fear i have been dragged to prison and in confinement i have remained near five months torn from the embraces of my young daughter who can no longer recline her head on that bosom from which she drew her first nourishment far removed from every thing dear to me the butt of all the envenomed shafts of an abused people that believes the loss of my head would be conducive to its happiness hearing the guards who watch under my grated window sometimes amuse themselves with anticipating my punishment and reading the offensive libels published against me by writers who never saw my face any more than those of whose hatred i am an object i have wearied no one with my remonstrances from time i expect justice and the termination of prejudice wanting many things i have asked for nothing i have made up my mind to misfortune proud of opposing my strength against hers and keeping her at my feet my necessities becoming urgent     and afraid of involving in trouble them to whom i might have addressed myself i wished to sell the empty bottles in my cellar which had not been sealed up because its contents were of so little value immediately the whole quarter was in motion the house was surrounded the proprietor was taken into custody the guards were doubled and perhaps i have reason to fear for the liberty of a poor nurse who has committed no crime but that of having served me with affection thirteen years because i made her life comfortable so much does the people stunned with the cry of conspiracy and misled with respect to me suppose me deserving the appellation of a conspirator it is not to excite pity in you robespierre to which i am superiour and which perhaps i should deem an insult that i present to you this picture which i have considerably softened it is for your instruction fortune is fickle and popular favour is not less addicted to change contemplate the fate of them who have agitated pleased or governed the people from viscellinus to cæsar and from hippo the haranguer of the syracusans to our parisian orator justice and truth alone remain and afford consolation for whatever may happen even for death itself whilst nothing can shelter men from their strokes marius and sylla proscribed thousands of knights numbers of senators and a multitude of unfortunate wretches but could they stifle the voice of history which has devoted their memories to execration or could they taste the cup of happiness     whatever fate be reserved for me i can submit to it in a manner worthy of myself or forestal it if i think proper after having received the honours of persecution are those of martyrdom to crown the whole am i destined to languish in protracted captivity exposed to the first catastrophe that it may be judged requisite to excite or am i to be sentenced to nominal transportation to experience when a few leagues at sea that trifling negligence on the part of the captain which rids him of the trouble of his living cargo to the profit of the waves tell me which for it is something to know our fate and a soul like mine is capable of looking it in the face if you will be just and read with reflection what i write my letter will not be useless to you and in that case it may possibly be of service to my country be that as it may robespierre i know and you cannot but feel that a person who has known me cannot persecute me without remorse roland formerly phlipon note the idea of this letter the design of writing it and the intention of sending it have remained in my mind for fourandtwenty hours but what effect can my reflections have on a man who sacrifices colleagues of whose integrity he is fully assured     if my letter will do no service it would be illtimed it would only embroil me to no purpose with a tyrant who may sacrifice but cannot debase me i will not send it end of the first part  this correspondence was very active for several years frequently diurnal during her abode at amiens my memory retraces imperfectly some very interesting letters i cannot now find them possibly they are with several others in the hands of lanthenas to whom that correspondence was frequently common he then considered it and with reason as of great importance but now—  this was not my strongest inducement for tired of the course of affairs i feared nothing for myself innocent and courageous injustice might reach but could not degrade me and to suffer it was a trial in the thought of braving
