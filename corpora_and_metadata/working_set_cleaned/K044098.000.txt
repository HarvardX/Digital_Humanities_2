remarks upon the eighth section of the second volume of mr wartons history of english poetry  the author is certainly at liberty to fancy cases and make whatever comparisons he thinks proper his suppositions still continue as distant from fact as his wild discourses are from solid argument junius london printed for t pain and son at the mewsgate  price one shilling  remarks etc in the annual register for      mr dodsley has resumed the subject of rowlies poems the whole of this second publication is taken as he tells us from mr wartons history of english poetry whose opinion from his knowledge as an antiquarian and judgment as a man of taste he looks upon as decisive these extracts made me desirous of reading the whole section from which they were taken i accordingly read it very carefully and i am sorry to say that the information i gained from it was by no means answerable to what i had a right to expect from the reputed abilities and character of that author  the method the professor there lays down to himself is to give us  is it some account of the manner in which rowlies poems were brought to light  dly some specimens of them he then adds his own opinion viz that rowlie was not the author that chatterton was  that rowlie was not the author he endeavors to prove  st by external arguments  dly by internal some levelled against the collection of poems in general others against particular pieces  the external arguments are as follow that the form of the letters essentially differs from every one of our ancient manuscripts that the characters were not uniform that care had been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow cast that the parchments themselves had been stained with ocre which was easily rubbed off the manuscript too which he had examined carefully himself bad it seems some heraldic delineations not suitable to the time which confirm him still more in his opinion  the internal arguments are these an affectation of obsolete words and spellings improper combinations of them and improper contexture with the present modes of speech the inconsistency of the style in different pieces the consistency spirit and excellence of the collection in general  the particular pieces whose authenticity he questions are the song to aella etc j lydgates answer sir c baldwin the battle of hastings the accounte of w canynges feast the epistle prefixed to the tragedy and through that the tragedy itself  having now proved them to his own satisfaction at least not to be rowlies he at once determines them to be chattertons whom he conceives to have been very capable of such an imposture from his natural abilities and turn of disposition from his situation and connections and from the little difficulty which such a forgery as this would be attended with  these i believe are the chief grounds upon which our author argues and as far as can be collected from a treatise which is not always so regular as it might have been the amount of every thing he says  having thus given the reader this short view of the professors arguments i shall now proceed to examine them particularly as to the method observed by me i shall say nothing that being entirely the professors own  first therefore of the narration or account he gives of the manner in which the poems were brought to light how far this is distinct and clear and agreeable to the general laws of narrative it is not my present business to inquire the accuracy of it in regard to truth and fact is all that comes under my notice in which it certainly fails at least if credit is to be given to persons who have examined the matter on the spot with whose accounts the professor does not always seem to agree sometimes the difference between them is trifling such as calling the wooden chest an iron one etc and indeed would hardly be worth mentioning were they not proofs that the professor had never been at bristol though i believe he was once within sixteen miles of it the age of chatterton is a very material circumstance he is said by the professor to have been about seventeen when the poems were discovered but as he was born at the latter end of      and the poems were discovered at latest in the autumn of      he could not then have been quitesixteen the difference of this year will be of more importance than appears at first sight when we consider that he was not known as an author till after fifteen the time at which he left school where his necessary employment was such that he could hardly have much leisure for other studies  as to the professors specimens of these poems whatever his judgment in selecting them may have been accuracy in transcribing them seems to be what he has very little attended to for instance the description of the morning which is ascribed by him to the minstrels is a part of celmondes speech after the victory at watchet in the chorus or interlude of the damsel who drowns herself scarce one line agrees with the printed copy the song to aella he transcribes at length john lydgates answer he determines to be beneath transcription but that it may not pass wholly unnoticed he gives us a long note to prove it a forgery this argument has certainly the appearance of being misplaced but it is to be presumed that the professor had his reasons for it this parchment which contained the song to aella j lydgates answer and the introductory letter was one of the very few that chatterton ever produced as originals the reasons for which its authenticity is doubted by the professor are these that turgotus and chaucer are both said to have lived in norman times which as he rightly observes might be true of turgotus who died in      but could not be equally applied to chaucer who was nearly cotemporary with lydgate perhaps in those times the particle and might not connect so strongly as it does at present and turgot may be joined with chaucer only as referring to his excellence and not to the time in which he lived but supposing this remark to be just it will as well prove that chatterton did not write it as that lydgate did not his antiquarian knowledge according to the professor being such as must have informed him better besides chaucer was his favorite author whose glossary he continually consulted it is therefore very near as improbable that such an anachronism should come from him as from lydgate himself the professors next remark is that chaucer and turgot are oddly coupled in another respect as the latter only wrote some latin chronicles now turgot wrote not in latin but in his mother tongue according to bale nor were his works by the same authors account entirely historical it is urged likewise by the professor as another objection that stowe is mentioned as living with chaucer and turgot this stowe he says to show his learning where reasons only are wanted should be stone who was lydgates cotemporary that this stowe should be stone is very probable as the letters n and w were so alike in this very parchment that chatterton read the authors name ronlie till he was set right by mr barret as to the other assertion of the professors that stowe is mentioned as living with chaucer and turgot the words upon which he founds it are in norman times turgotus and great chaucer did excel then stowe the bristol carmelyte etc whether this does not mean directly the contrary to what the professor says it does i shall leave to the reader to determine the professors last argument against this piece is the extreme and affected meanness of the composition the word affected is most probably here foisted in to avoid the absurdity of supposing this poem and the song to aella the serious productions of the same person whether the meanness of any composition can be admitted of as a conclusive proof that it is forged may justly be doubted but the professor would have done well to have considered the consequences fully before he risqued so dangerous a doctrine but to return to the extracts where among others he cites a passage from a dialogue between two ladies viz a soliloquy of one gentleman this circumstance is of little or no weight on either side and i have only mentioned it to exemplify what he himself confesses that his quotations are not always so accurate as they might have been  having thus prepared his readers for his opinion he accordingly gives it and very decisively viz that none of these pieces are genuine this he rests upon the following circumstances which are i presume his external arguments among these the first is that sir charles bawdin is allowed to be modern even by those who maintain all the others to be ancient in all the enquiries i have been able to make i never yet found any body who allowed this who they were who did allow it and of what authority i could wish the professor had told us at present his proof cannot be of any great weight with those who are not already predetermined to grant that the poem is modern his note upon the passage certainly does not carry much conviction what is there contained although doubtless very curious being in general but little to the purpose what there is to the purpose rather in favor of the poem than the contrary  the professors next objections are drawn from the parchment which contained the song to aella and j lydgates answer viz that the writing was a gross and palpable forgery not even skilfully counterfeited that the letters though artfully contrived to wear an antiquated appearance differed from all our ancient alphabets that they were not uniform that the parchment had been stained with ocre which was easily rubbed off and that care had been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow cast part of this would if clearly proved have great weight with many however this does not rest it seems upon the professors authority but upon his friends perhaps it is not quite fair in him to bring such very positive assertions about manuscripts which cannot now be referred to as they are to use his own expression unfortunately lost the manner of their loss was too as i have heard extraordinary this the professor says nothing of whether his friend had been tender of giving him any information on so delicate a subject or whether he thought it might injure his cause and has therefore slurred it over it matters not we must lament and not enquire as to their being stained with ocre i have heard from the best authority that one of the manuscripts was not stained with ocre at least when it left bristol the yellow roll as the name implies was originally stained for distinction sake nor if there had been any such stain upon the first would it have proved it modern as from some notices i have received to use the professors own classical expression i find that most of the parchments in many archives throughout the kingdom have a sort of yellow dust upon them which the converting fancy of an ingenious critic might especially if inclined before to do so easily misinterpret into ocre as to the ink i do not mean to undervalue the abilities of the professors friend it must however require a greater degree of sagacity than i can well conceive to determine exactly whether the yellow cast of the ink was the effect of time or accident or art but after all to what purpose all this it is surely unnecessary for if the professors word may be taken he has already proved lydgates answer which was on the same parchment and apparently in the same hand a manifest imposition what i have above hinted in regard to this same note will i hope make the reader a little scrupulous how he receives any thing from the professor as an unquestionable truth till he shall have examined it himself pretty carefully at least put him so far upon his guard as not to take any thing at the professors hands entirely upon trust  but the professor not willing to leave the glory of so great a discovery entirely to his friend and to put things out of all doubt acquaints us that his own examination of the parchment containing the account of w canynges feast confirms very fully all that he has told us of the two other parchments on the authority of his friend this parchment he says with an appearance of sorrow betrayed all the suspicious circumstances observed in the ode to aella one would imagine that here at least he must have been uncommonly accurate having by all accounts had the manuscript in his possession long enough of all conscience to have made himself thoroughly master of it but i never heard any one except himself say that it was stained with ocre or that care had been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow cast as to the difference of the handwriting from that of the age that even supposing it to be true will not i apprehend be looked upon by every one as a decisive proof till the necessity that all cotemporary writers should write the same hand is made to appear even the style and drawing of the armorial bearings are said by the professor to discover the hand of a modern herald as to these from all i have been able to learn they are not reducible to any sort of heraldry that ever was but that i may not seem to take a malicious pleasure in disputing every thing he asserts and accepting and availing myself of those concessions which he so generously makes without making him any in return i will if he pleases give him up this piece perhaps it may be a forgery there are more reasons for thinking so of this than of any other but the professor seems not to have hit upon them the remark with which he concludes these external arguments is rather unfortunate he believes it seems that this accounte of w canynges feast is the only pretended original of rowlies poetry now remaining to talk in so very heedless a manner is hardly using his readers fairly the least attention to the point in hand even once reading over the poem might have shown him that canynge and not rowlie was the reputed author of it  having thus finished his external evidence he proceeds secondly to the internal his first proof here is the unnatural affectation of ancient spelling and obsolete words not belonging to the period assigned these poems which according to him must strike us at first sight what he means by not belonging to the period assigned these poems does not i own immediately strike me does he mean that they belong to any period before rowlies time or any subsequent one or does he intend to hint by these words what mr tyrwhitt has told us that many of them are not to be found anywhere whichever is his meaning he has expressed it rather obscurely but at all events he might certainly have avoided this with little trouble to himself and much satisfaction to his readers by citing some instances his next mark of forgery is that combinations of these old words are formed which never yet existed in the unpolished state of the english language that the antiquated diction is often inartificially misapplied by an improper contexture of the present modes of speech here again as i have observed just now it were to be wished that the professor had given us some instances it would have saved me and possibly some others much trouble for my own part i have searched and with some diligence for these contextures and combinations but hitherto with little success but what is of more importance the poet sometimes forgets his assumed character and does not always act his part with consistency for the interlude of the damsel who drowns herself is much more intelligible and free from uncouth expressions than the general phraseology of these compositions this may be easily accounted for by the genius of elegiac poetry which is naturally simple and unaffected there is however another way of accounting for this difference more decisive though less obvious which is that the professor seems to have modernized it in no less than fortyeight places which one would imagine was not so very easy a task as the whole poem consists only of nine stanzas many of his other quotations are inaccurate as he himself rightly observes but none so much as this in other parts his alterations seem to give the words a more antiquated cast in the poem before us this would have defeated the end he had in view the modern appearance of the poem being what he founds his objection upon  having now gone through as i imagined at least for i found myself mistaken as the reader will see very shortly his general proofs he comes to particular pieces v g in the battle of hastings stonehenge is called a druidical temple but about turgots time according to the professor no other report prevailed about this miraculous monument than that it was erected in memory of hengists massacre this he says was the established and uniform opinion of the welsh and armorican bards who had it from the saxon minstrels that the druids constructed this stupendous pile for a place of worship was a discovery reserved for the sagacity of a wiser age and the laborious discussion of modern antiquaries let us examine a little upon what foundation this great traditional authority is built we have it from the professor whom we certainly have not too much reason to give implicit credit to  who had it from geoffry of monmouth whose romance is nothing more than a collection of mere fables  who had it from the armorican bards none of whose works are now extant if ever there were any  who had it from the saxon minstrels who i believe were never extant at all so that this tradition has its original nowhere  is transmitted by people whose testimony does not exist  confirmed by one of the most notorious liars that ever lived and the last stamp put to its authenticity by the professor what infidels must we be who do not submit to such irrefragable evidence but supposing this was the common report which by no means appears is it impossible that a man of learning should have known the truth though contrary to common report he must at least have had better materials so much nearer the times than our modern antiquaries who are supposed to be the first authors of this discovery and perhaps as much sagacity to have made use of them his next proof is from the epistle to lydgate meaning i suppose the epistle to canynge in which he says some great story of human manners is recommended as the subject most suitable for theatrical representation this idea he says is the result of that taste and discrimination which could only belong to a more advanced period of society supposing this quotation was in rowlies words which it is not what direct proof against the tragedys being ancient can be built upon it is it improbable that a man of taste should be disgusted at the absurdity of the dramatical representations which usually prevailed in the age when this was supposed to be written that his genius taste or learning should point out to him the proper object of dramatic poetry  the efforts of genius have not always kept exact pace with the state of society as at some times they have followed it but slowly so at others they have advanced beyond it this argument is seconded by a long note which however contains nothing more than some cavils upon two or three words viz that by minster must be meant the present cathedral at bristol that bristol is called a city which it was not till   0 years after rowlie and that accounte in his time had not lost its original sense and spelling but in fact st ewins church at bristol was anciently called the minster and not the present cathedral however let us grant that it was the present cathedral the present cathedral was at that time an augustine monastery according to the professor in this very note  and minster is by the same authority in the additions and emendations upon this note  said in its simple acceptance to signify monastery so that if it was called minster it was called by its right name the second word is in the prose writings where much is very probably interpolated and about which i never could get any information i could depend upon the account of w canynges feast as i have before hinted and shall show by and by is much to be suspected to be suspected in many particulars and most in the title  but to follow the professor back to his general arguments and to use his own very expressive words above all the cast of the thought the complexion of the sentiment and the structure of the composition evidently prove these pieces not ancient the ode to aella he says has exactly the air of modern poetry such as is written at this day only disguised with antique spelling and phraseology but if this be really the professors opinion he must have been peculiarly fortunate as very few things which have been published lately or perhaps at any time can stand in competition with them but supposing the poems are superior to modern ones even that can hardly prove them forgeries many writers of undoubted authority differ much in style from their cotemporaries terence and plautus who wrote in the same way as well as in the same age are as different in point of style as any two writers who lived in different ages could have been a similar instance occurs among our own authors bishop halls virgidemiae were i believe published before dr donnes satires the difference between them when considered as cotemporary writers is astonishing as great certainly as between rowlie and lydgate or any other that lived either at or near those times no positive conclusion can therefore be drawn from this kind of objections  these i believe are all the internal arguments which the professor has vouchsafed to give us and of these few seem to make good the point they are designed for much fewer to be of the least importance objections of weight seem to have been left purposely unsupported either by argument or instance however high the professors authority may be to have his bare assertions taken for proof is a greater deference than he can reasonably expect  having thus proved to his own satisfaction that rowlie is not the author of these poems he at once ascribes them to chatterton whom he represents as a prodigy of genius of such talents for poetry that he would have proved the first of english poets had he reached a maturer age whoever will read the poems published in his name may perhaps doubt this very extraordinary account of his abilities there cannot in my opinion be any two collections of poems more essentially different than chattertons and rowlies the former have every imperfection one might expect from the authors age and excel in those points only which are more within the reach of a boy his verses generally flow off in exact cadence and harmony sometimes the thoughts are better expressed than any one reasonably could have expected but if any one looks for the propriety consistency conduct and spirit of rowlie he will be much disappointed where does chatterton observe any one of the rules of good writing where does rowlie fail in one in short whatever has been said by the professor upon the inequality and impropriety of the old english bards may be applied with much more justice to chatterton what his early compositions written without any design to deceive were which the first critic of the present age speaks so highly of i do not know any more than who this first critic is nor is it in my opinion quite fair of the professor to give so very extraordinary a character of these poems without specifying which of them they are or giving us some specimens of them any more than to overbear us with such irresistible authority without letting us know who this firstrate critic is this image which he has set up for us all to bow down to if however those poems the professor means are in the abovementioned collection i cannot pay so much deference to this anonymous critic or even to the professor himself as to pronounce them so very wonderful there are certainly marks of genius in them far beyond his education but i cannot say that i have yet met with any thing which promises to make him the first of english poets that by his situation and connections he was a skilful practitioner in various kinds of handwriting will be found perhaps on inquiry a mere supposition of the professors by better authority than the professors viz the authority of those who taught him his common hand was a bad one and he wrote very slow or in the professors words had but little facility in the graphic art the attorney to whom he was articled never employed him except in writing precedents from these circumstances it cannot but be evident that the professor had not sufficient grounds for this assertion in regard to a sufficient quantity of obsolete words and phrases those according to the professor were readily attainable from the glossary to chaucer and percys ballads as for percy perhaps it is barely worth remarking that very few of the words used by rowlie i question if ten are to be met with in that glossary as to chaucer the edition chatterton had was if i remember the very first that had a glossary to it which is shorter almost by half than any other and does not contain a fifth part so much as the glossary to the last edition now surely this must have been a very poor help for any one much less a sufficient means to have enabled one of his age his education and in many other respects circumstanced as he was to write such poems and to such a number as these called rowlies  the professor pleased with the success of this last argument makes us with all the security of a conqueror a kind of insulting concession and allows that some poems written by rowlie might have been preserved in canynges chest but says that if there were any they were so enlarged and improved by chatterton as to become entirely new compositions what alterations can have so surprising an effect as to make a transcript an original is i own above my comprehension that chatterton did corrupt many words and modernize others is very certain and the gross mistakes in many of his explications have since been discovered which mistakes are such as he could never possibly have committed had he been the author and followed his glossary the professor being tired of concession returns again to his old way of taking it for granted that he has proved things before he has made any advances toward it the account of w canynges feast bids he tells us the fairest for an original this he has already proved a forgery in answer to this i hope i may without the imputation of acting too much like the professor beg leave to suspend my assent in regard to both these assertions this poem would be safe enough if the professors objections were all that could be brought against its authenticity but there are other circumstances which may give us room to suspect its not being genuine it is very short there is little poetical merit in it very little beyond chattertons abilities and mr walpole had suggested to him the idea of forgery and shown him that he might pass for the author by doubting the authenticity of the other manuscripts but what with me is above all it has not been unfortunately lost as two which were thought by some of the best judges unquestionable originals have been but that this circumstance is alone sufficient to make us suspect that no originals ever existed is more than can be granted the proofs that even this manuscript is a forgery are by no means incontestable nor if they were would it follow of course that all or any of the other manuscripts must necessarily be so too  as to the motives which the professor assigns for such an imposture these are as extraordinary as his proof of it viz first lucrative views this i should apprehend could hardly have been the case as if i remember right he communicated the two first manuscripts without receiving any thing for them and the sums which he received for the others were by all accounts so small that he probably got more by the meanest of those he sent to the magazines as to the pleasure of deceiving the world which is the next motive our professor assigns that is what i have no idea of i do not mean from thence to argue that it is by any means impossible upon farther consideration it seems not wholly improbable and perhaps may be thought to have had its influence with writers of greater repute than chatterton that he should have preferred the private success of his imposture to the vanity of appearing as an applauded original author is utterly inconsistent with his general character it being well known that he never published any thing which he did not send an account of to all his friends and he never owned to any of them that what he had produced under the name of rowlie was an imposture  the professors thoughts seem so entirely possessed with his hero chatterton that i own i am somewhat surprised to find him returning so suddenly to rowlie and observing that in the notices which some of the chief patrons of rowlies poetry sent him from bristol it was affirmed that the order for the visitation of the chest this was the chest from which chatterton constantly said he had taken the poems it was deposited by canynges order in a muniment room in redcliffe church and was to be solemnly visited every year we have before had occasion to speak of was in canynges will where as he rightly observes there is no such order to be found i am afraid there must have been some mistake about these notices every body who has been at bristol must know and the professor if he had given himself the trouble to have gone thither might have known that it was a deed which contained this order and that he might as well have looked into his friend geoffrey of monmouth or slawkenbergius upon noses for it as into canynges will upon this with much show of accuracy and learning he transcribes a great part of the contents of this same will into a note for what reason but to prove that he had read it i cannot conceive and here because canynge was dean of westbury college he gives us a short history of the repairs of that college he might as well because canynge was a merchant have taken occasion to digress into a short dissertation upon trade for in fact all this learning and all this long quotation would have been just as much to the purpose and proved as much in one case as it does in the other had our professor bestowed but half as much care and accuracy upon the main points in dispute he might perhaps have gone some way toward settling this whole affair  as to the memoirs of rowlie i have little to say much possibly may be true and much interpolated for which reason and because as i have said before i never could get any account of this fragment at all satisfactory v g by whom it was first published through whose hands it first passed what authority it ultimately rests upon i shall not attempt to give any opinion at all upon the matter however the professors the words which he objects to are drawings in its present uncombined sense manuscripts abbot of coventrie instead of prior repayring lease objections being entirely against words do not seem to affect its authenticity in any article at all material  i have now gone through the professors section and i must say it has been a very disagreeable task to which the want of method did not a little contribute and what is worse it seems to be of very little concern with him whether he is right or wrong whether he informs or misleads his reader certainly however he does not fulfill the promise he made at the beginning of his section viz of laying before his reader every internal and external argument to enable him to determine upon the merits of this controversy indeed he tacitly confesses as much himself by annexing to it as he has done some additions and emendations from these i had i own some hopes of being more fully satisfied thinking that by this means he had a fair opportunity of retracting some of those rash assertions which he deals in so very largely and correcting at least some of the inaccuracies we so frequently meet with throughout the section but i am sorry to say that i was miserably disappointed the only addition i could perceive being that he has added false fact to false argument the only emendation that he has corrected himself when he happened by some mistake or other rather unusual with him to be in the right  the same method i prescribed to myself in examining the foregoing part of the professors work i shall follow in this also and give the reader a summary account of its contents before i examine it particularly these as far as the nature of the thing will admit of its being reduced to any settled form seem to the best of my apprehension to be as follow some additional cavils upon words some apology for inaccuracies and some new proofs for so he chooses to call them against the authenticity of the poems in general and one of them in particular the battle of hastings his arguments against the poems in general are from their being so excellent in themselves and so very unlike those of cotemporary writers against the battle of hastings in particular from the time at which turgot the supposed original author died and from the want of some distinguishing circumstances in the poem itself after this the professor enlarges afresh upon the peculiar merit of chatterton and the motives which might have tempted him to such a forgery  i am sorry to be forced to observe that the professor seems to set off rather ominously by correcting himself in one of the few truths and best grounded assertions to be met with in his whole section viz that turgot died in      fortynine years after the battle of hastings not in  0   fiftyone years before it as he now affirms in this correction with an intention to build an argument upon it this correction being no more than one line may escape many readers it is printed with a reference to the page but none to the subject thus page     not col   l   for      read  0     in the following note he informs us that he has received notices from st ewins church at bristol anciently called the minster which import that the pavement was washed against the coming of king edward which does not at all prove or imply that the king sat at the great minster window to see the gallant lancastrian pass to the scaffold that i may not seem to differ from him for cavilling sake i here entirely agree with him i believe the washing of the pavement was never urged as a proof that the king sat at the window but only as a corroborating circumstance of edwards being at bristol about that time the circumstance of his sitting at the window the professor objects to as improbable why i do not see as the general character of edward rather encourages such a supposition than contradicts it his next objection is that st ewins church was formerly called the minster but that he suspects that what the poet intended here by the word minster must have been the present cathedral and that he does not think that the minster of our lady was a common appellation for worcester cathedral at that time till the professor thinks fit to produce some ground for his suspicion and belief they cannot be considered as arguments of any great weight and if he really had made out both i do not see what advantage it would have been to him in regard to the point in hand  in his next note he confesses very frankly that he may have been guilty of some inaccuracies in his section and makes the reader an apology for them here again i think the professor perfectly in the right and as he has confessed thus much in general i do not think it would be amiss if he was to specify and retract all his errors as well in the additions and emendations as in the section itself it would not be much longer than his section which does not seem to have cost him overmuch trouble but to return to his apology he had not it seems when he wrote this eighth section seen all the poems what he had seen were only extracts and those extracts not always exact from these concessions of his own have we not some right to ask the professor the following questions why he chose to decide upon a subject which he had not thoroughly informed himself of why he took upon him to promise his readers every internal and external argument relating to the controversy at a time when by his own confession he had not read half the poems why in all the time between the writing of his section and the publication of his book he never took the trouble to go to bristol and examine the matter on the spot why since he has read the poems he has not corrected those errors which he owns he has committed  these interrogations are surely natural and the professor probably might find some difficulty in answering them for however great any mans critical abilities and antiquarian knowledge may be some little acquaintance with the subject he treats of must at least make his decision more satisfactory however even now since he has seen all the poems his opinion we find is still the same they have even afforded him some new proofs the first of which seems to be nothing more than that rowlie is not like any of our ancient bards he has told us before that the poems are like modern ones which is pretty much the same thing but neither the excellence of any composition any more than the meanness of it nor indeed the dissimilitude between that and other cotemporary writings are by any means an absolute proof that it must be a forgery his next argument is that the poems in question appear to have been composed after ideas of discrimination took place what sort of poems they must be which were composed before such a period for my part i own i am somewhat at a loss to conceive as such ideas seem always to be of some little use if not absolutely and indispensably necessary in making any poems whether ancient or modern intelligible  but in the battle of hastings there are some great anachronisms and practices mentioned which did not subsist till afterward the professor has not however pointed out any particular ones and if there were any they have escaped my observation and i am apt to believe will do the same to most readers his next proof and which perhaps if true would be quite decisive is as follows turgot from whose saxon chronicle no longer a latin one this poem is said to be translated died in  0   and therefore could not have written any account of the battle of hastings which did not happen till  0   viz fiftyone years after his death this i own appeared at first sight to have great weight as i did not conceive it possible that any one could be so very ignorant of the author whom he had actually translated or that one of the professors character should have misrepresented in so very extraordinary a manner so material a date as this especially as he had founded one of his principal arguments upon it upon looking into bale nicholson and some others it appears that this latter viz that the professor has misrepresented the case is the fact and that turgot did not die till      as the professor had rightly observed at first in his note upon j lydgates answer etc but finding it would stand in the way of this argument corrected it afterward in his additions and emendations and has here produced his own error or whatever else the reader shall think proper to call it as a proof that the poem is a forgery if this be one of those anachronisms the professor has hinted at before and they are all no better founded than this he has certainly shown great judgment in keeping them to himself but allowing that turgot might have lived in the time of the conqueror yet it is very extraordinary that a cotemporary writer should mention nothing but what we knew before and that the incidents are such as are common in all battles what peculiarities would have satisfied the professor is not easy to conceive there are surely distinguishing circumstances enough in this poem to give it every mark of being genuine that could reafonably have been expected by any one it agrees with other histories in such a manner as to prove its authenticity that way and where it disagrees it is in such a manner as rather to prove it an original that way some incidents must be the same in all battles in this however there feem to be many very distinguishing ones but it is the hard fate of rowlie to have his poems found fault with every way if a circumstance not mentioned in other writers occurs such as stonehenges being a druidical temple that is urged against him as a proof of forgery if he agrees with other writers his poem is condemned upon that account as if in the first case those who lived some centuries nearer the times of the druids might not have been better informed than those who lived so many centuries after in the latter as if it was impossible that two writers should agree in the same story  having thus shown this piece to be spurious he proceeds from this very piece to demonstrate the spuriousness of the rest chatterton allowed the first part to be a forgery of his own the second part from what has been said cannot be genuine and he who could write the second part could write every line in the whole collection this train of consequences is i own more than i can comprehend the conclusion he means to draw from it is probably that chatterton did write every line in the whole collection how this is made out the reader may possibly see i do not and can therefore do no more than object to the parts separately and first of chattertons declaration how far we can rely upon this is much to be doubted the professor however as it serves his turn has chosen to give credit to him but sure any one else has at least as much right to believe him when he assirmed the second part to be rowlies as the professor has when he affirmed the first part to be his own nor is the second part proved a forgery from any thing that has been said by the professor except chattertons declaring the first was his own proves the second was so too if this be what the professor would have us believe his conclusion can hardly be allowed if he would insinuate that his own arguments have proved it a forgery that i think is still less likely to be admitted of  after this the professor in another most gracious mood of concession  whether from some misgivings of the force of his arguments or from confidence in the strength of them or for any other reason known only to himself i shall not presume to say  with his usual candor grants that it is possible chatterton may not be the author but if it was so he says it is no proof that the poems are not forged but this is a new and another question i cannot help observing however how extremely improbable it is that any man who could write such poems as these should be against owning them when neither life nor safety nor interest of any kind was in the case but that he should usher his imposture into the world by means of a boy who had just left a charityschool and whose veracity from his known character every one would be inclined to suspect is every thing but impossible it is also equally increadible that a boy of little more than fifteen whose avowed works have not such marks of genius in them as the professor would make us believe  who had never learnt any thing except reading writing and accounts  whose time from the day he left school was mostly taken up in writing for an attorney  whose leisure hours were wasted in debauchery  who died wanting upwards of three months of eighteen  should have either time or abilities to contrive and execute such a forgery i hope those few pieces in the magazines which the professor has been so kind as to point out and whose peculiar merit might otherwise have escaped the generality of readers are not instances of that astonishing prematurity of abilities comprehension of mind and vigor of understanding which predominated over his situations in life and opportunities of instruction many of them are very bald and in my opinion at most very unsuccessful imitations of ossian without any great marks of genius or spirit that he wished to put off some of his own poems for rowlies is certain i myself have seen some written with such a design but so unlike rowlie that to unbiassed readers it must appear impossible that the same person should have written those and the collection printed in rowlies name they are the worst even of chattertons own compositions and show that however antiquarian imagery had possessed his imagination it communicated no share of excellence to his composition  this to the best of my judgment is the sum of every thing at all material that the professor has advanced by way of argument in any of which i should be sorry to have omitted or misrepresented the minutest circumstance the latter i have endeavored to guard against on all occasions as strictly as i possibly could by using as much as possible his own words and if i do not flatter myself too much i have i hope made it appear to every unprejudiced reader that his narrative is by no means exact nor his quotations faithful that his external arguments are far from being satisfactory his internal neither fair nor conclusive that chatterton was not equal to the composition of such poems either by his natural or his acquired abilities in a word that the professors system throughout is not supported by a single argument that holds good or a single fact that may not be questioned  finis
