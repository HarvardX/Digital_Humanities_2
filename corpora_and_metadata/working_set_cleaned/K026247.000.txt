a conversation between his most sacred majesty george iii and samuel johnson lld illustrated with observations by james boswell esquire  london printed by henry baldwin for charles dilly in the poultry  mdccxc  price half a guinea  entered in the hallbook of the company of stationers  a conversation etc in february      there happened one of the most remarkable incidents of johnsons life which gratified his monarchical enthusiasm and which he loved to relate with all its circumstances when requested by his friends this was his being honored by a private conversation with his majesty in the library at the queens house he had frequently visited those splendid rooms and noble collection of books dr johnson had the honor of contributing his assistance toward the formation of this library for i have read a long letter from him to mr barnard giving the most masterly instructions on the subject i wished much to have gratified my readers with the perusal of this letter and have reason to think that his majesty would have been graciously pleased to permit its publication but mr barnard to whom i applied declined it on his own account  which he used to say was more numerous and curious than he supposed any person could have made in the time which the king had employed mr barnard the librarian took care that he should have every accommodation that could contribute to his ease and convenience while indulging his literary taste in that place so that he had here a very agreeable resource at leisure hours  his majesty having been informed of his occasional visits was pleased to signify a desire that he should be told when dr johnson came next to the library accordingly the next time that johnson did come as soon as he was fairly engaged with a book on which while he sat by the fire he seemed quite intent mr barnard stole round to the apartment where the king was and in obedience to his majestys commands mentioned that dr johnson was then in the library his majesty said he was at leisure and would go to him upon which mr barnard took one of the candles that stood on the kings table and lighted his majesty through a suite of rooms till they came to a private door into the library of which his majesty had the key being entered mr barnard stepped forward hastily to dr johnson who was still in a profound study and whispered him sir here is the king johnson started up and stood still his majesty approached him and at once was courteously easy the particulars of this conversation i have been at great pains to collect with the utmost authenticity from dr johnsons own detail to myself from mr langton who was present when he gave an account of it to dr joseph warton and several other friends at sir joshua reynoldss from mr barnard from the copy of a letter written by the late mr strahan the printer to bishop warburton and from a minute the original of which is among the papers of the late sir james caldwell and a copy of which was most obligingly obtained for me from his son sir john caldwell by sir francis lumm to all these gentlemen i beg leave to make my grateful acknowledgements and particularly to sir francis lumm who was pleased to take a great deal of trouble and even had the minute laid before the king by lord caermarthen now duke of leeds one of his majestys principal secretaries of state who announced to sir francis the royal pleasure concerning it by a letter in these words i have the kings commands to assure you sir how sensible his majesty is of your attention in communicating the minute of the conversation previous to its publication as there appears no objection to your complying with mr boswells wishes on the subject you are at full liberty to deliver it to that gentleman to make such use of in his life of dr johnson as he may think proper   his majesty began by observing that he understood he came sometimes to the library and then mentioning his having heard that the doctor had been lately at oxford asked him if he was not fond of going thither to which johnson answered that he was indeed fond of going to oxford sometimes but was likewise glad to come back again the king then asked him what they were doing at oxford johnson answered he could not much commend their diligence but that in some respects they were mended for they had put their press under better regulations and were at that time printing polybius he was then asked whether there were better libraries at oxford or cambridge he answered he believed the bodleian was larger than any they had at cambridge at the same time adding i hope whether we have more books or not than they have at cambridge we shall make as good use of them as they do being asked whether all souls or christchurch library was the largest he answered all souls library is the largest we have except the bodleian aye said the king that is the public library  his majesty enquired if he was then writing any thing he answered he was not for he had pretty well told the world what he knew and must now read to acquire more knowledge the king as it should seem with a view to urge him to rely on his own stores as an original writer and to continue his labors then said i do not think you borrow much from any body johnson said he thought he had already done his part as a writer i should have thought so too said the king if you had not written so well  johnson observed to me upon this that no man could have paid a handsomer compliment and it was fit for a king to pay it was decisive when asked by another friend at sir joshua reynoldss whether he made any reply to this high compliment he answered no sir when the king had said it it was to be so it was not for me to bandy civilities with my sovereign perhaps no man who had spent his whole life in courts could have shown a more nice and dignified sense of true politeness than johnson did in this instance  his majesty having observed to him that he supposed he must have read a great deal johnson answered that he thought more than he read that he had read a great deal in the early part of his life but having fallen into ill health he had not been able to read much compared with others for instance he said he had not read much compared with dr warburton upon which the king said that he heard dr warburton was a man of such general knowledge that you could scarce talk with him on any subject on which he was not qualified to speak and that his learning resembled garricks acting in its universality his majesty then talked of the controversy between warburton and lowth which he seemed to have read and asked johnson what he thought of it johnson answered warburton has most general most scholastic learning lowth is the more correct scholar i do not know which of them calls names best the king was pleased to say he was of the same opinion adding you do not think then dr johnson that there was much argument in the case johnson said he did not think there was why truly said the king when once it comes to calling names argument is pretty well at an end  his majesty then asked him what he thought of lord lytteltons history which was then just published johnson said he thought his style pretty good but that he had blamed henry the second rather too much why said the king they seldom do these things by halves no sir answered johnson not to kings but fearing to be misunderstood he proceeded to explain himself and immediately subjoined that for those who spoke worse of kings than they deserved he could find no excuse but that he could more easily conceive how some might speak better of them than they deserved without any ill intention for as kings had much in their power to give those who were favored by them would frequently from gratitude exaggerate their praises and as this proceeded from a good motive it was certainly excuseable as far as error could be excuseable  the king then asked him what he thought of dr hill johnson answered that he was an ingenious man but had no veracity and immediately mentioned as an instance of it an assertion of that writer that he had seen objects magnified to a much greater degree by using three or four microscopes at a time than by using one now added johnson every one acquainted with microscopes knows that the more of them he looks through the less the object will appear why replied the king this is not only telling an untruth but telling it clumsily for if that be the case every one who can look through a microscope will be able to detect him  i now said johnson to his friends when relating what had passed began to consider that i was depreciating this man in the estimation of his sovereign and thought it was time for me to say something that might be more favorable he added therefore that dr hill was notwithstanding a very curious observer and if he would have been contented to tell the world no more than he knew he might have been a very considerable man and needed not to have recourse to such mean expedients to raise his reputation  the king then talked of literary journals mentioned particularly the journal des savans and asked johnson if it was well done johnson said it was formerly very well done and gave some account of the persons who began it and carried it on for some years enlarging at the same time on the nature and use of such works the king asked him if it was well done now johnson answered he had no reason to think that it was the king then asked him if there were any other literary journals published in this kingdom except the monthly and critical reviews and on being answered there were no other his majesty asked which of them was the best johnson answered that the monthly review was done with most care the critical upon the best principles adding that the authors of the monthly review were enemies to the church this the king said he was sorry to hear  the conversation next turned on the philosophical transactions when johnson observed that they had now a better method of arranging their materials than formerly aye said the king they are obliged to dr johnson for that for his majesty had heard and remembered the circumstance which johnson himself had forgot  his majesty expressed a desire to have the literary biography of this country ably executed and proposed to dr johnson to undertake it johnson signified his readiness to comply with his majestys wishes  during the whole of this interview johnson talked to his majesty with profound respect but still in his firm manly manner with a sonorous voice and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the drawing room after the king withdrew johnson showed himself highly pleased with his majestys conversation and gracious behavior he said to mr barnard sir they may talk of the king as they will but he is the finest gentleman i have ever seen and he afterward observed to mr langton sir his manners are those of as fine a gentleman as we may suppose lewis the fourteenth or charles the second  at sir joshua reynoldss where a circle of johnsons friends was collected round him to hear his account of this memorable conversation dr joseph warton in his frank and lively manner was very active in pressing him to mention the particulars come now sir this is an interesting matter do favor us with it johnson with great good humor complied  he told them i found his majesty wished i should talk and i made it my business to talk i find it does a man good to be talked to by his sovereign in the first place a man cannot be in a passion   here some question interrupted him which is to be regretted as he certainly would have pointed out and illustrated many circumstances of advantage from being in a situation where the powers of the mind are at once excited to vigorous exertion and tempered by reverential awe  during all the time in which dr johnson was employed in relating to the circle at sir joshua reynoldss the particulars of what passed between the king and him dr goldsmith remained unmoved upon a sopha at some distance affecting not to join in the least in the eager curiosity of the company he assigned as a reason for his gloom and seeming inattention that he apprehended johnson had relinquished his purpose of furnishing him with a prologue to his play with the hopes of which he had been flattered but it was strongly suspected that he was fretting with chagrin and envy at the singular honor dr johnson had lately enjoyed at length the frankness and simplicity of his natural character prevailed he sprung from the sopha advanced to johnson and in a kind of flutter from imagining himself in the situation which he had just been hearing described exclaimed well you acquitted yourself in this conversation better than i should have done for i should have bowed and stammered through the whole of it
