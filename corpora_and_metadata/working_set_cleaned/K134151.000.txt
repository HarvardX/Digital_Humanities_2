wilson a m mr john wilday mr joseph watkins jun y mr thomas yardley preface addressed to john sargent esquire member of parliament etc worthy sir as the following dissertations owe their birth to your judicious choice of the subject and liberal encouragement of it they now naturally wait upon you for your protection and countenance your original design having been only to excite a noble emulation among the youth of an infant seminary in a remote part of the world and to turn their early attention to a matter of very high and national importance you will not look for any thing in the execution beyond their years their experience or opportunities of information  your known candor will likewise lead you to consider the peculiar difficulties arising from the times and circumstances in which these pieces were composed an act of the british parliament had become the fatal cause of an unhappy breach of that union which had so long subsisted and ever ought to subsi between the colonies and the mother country and very general were the agitations and uneasiness thereby produced on this side of the atlantic even hoary age and men of the most subdued passions among us admiting the most plenary jurisdiction of a british parliament could not in this particular case but consider their conduct as at least unkind to their american fellow subjects in desiring without any present necessity that appeared to us to come between us and our sovereign and to lay a foundation which might easily have been drawn into a precedent for depriving us of all future opportunities of testifying our loyalty by the free and voluntary grant of our own money  if then such was the light in which the cool and the aged considered this matter expressions of a warmer and more unguarded kind might have dropped from the pens of youth yet no such thing appears in the following dissertations which are laid before the public in the genuine form and dress wherein they were presented by their authors nor was it possible that the smallest additions or alterations could be made consistent with the plan pursued in the execution of your trust which plan you ought to have an account of and it may also be of use to preserve it here by way of precedent for future occasions of the like kind  several considerations having prevented the trustees of the college from proposing your medals to be contended for by the youth the first year after the receipt of them they were at last proposed by an advertisement as follows viz  college of philadelphia march        whereas john sargent esquire merchant in london and member of parliament has presented to this college a only so much of the advertisement is here inserted as relates to the disposition of the medal which produced the following essays mr sargents other medal not being yet disposed of gold medal for the best english essay on the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual union between great britain and her american colonies  notice is hereby given by order of the trustees that the said medal will be disposed of at the ensuing commencement in may for the best essay that shall be produced on the subject proposed by any of those who have received any degree or part of their education in this college  and as the said subject is one of the most important which can at this time employ the pen of the patriot or scholar and is thus left open to all those who have had any connection with this college either as students or graduates it is hoped for the honor of the seminary as well as their own they will nobly exert themselves on a subject so truly animating which may be treated in a manner alike interesting to good men both here and in the mother country  each candidate is desired to prefix a motto and a mark or device to his performance and seal it up without his name in a separate cover he is then to put his name under another saled cover writing on the outside of this cover the same motto and mark or device which he has prefixed to his performance  the utmost impartiality will be observed by the trustees and professors in examining the several performances without opening any of the covers that contain the names till it is first determined which of the performances is entitled to the medal and then only that cover will be opened on which the motto is written that directs to the name of the person entitled to the prize which shall be given in public at the ensuing commencement and therefore the several candidates are desired to send their compositions and names sealed and covered as aforesaid to the provost on or before the  th day of may    on the  th day of may accordingly nine different performances were produced on a careful perusal of which the three immediately following were laid aside for a second reading after which the medal was unanmously decreed to the first the second also was judged a masterly judicious and sensible performance worthy of a medal also if there had been another for the same subject and the third was likewise greatly approved of as a spirited performance so far as it went and it was agreed that the publication of both together with the prizepiece would be of service at this crisis which determination was immediately inserted in the public papers in pursuance whereof the modest and ingenious youth who is author of the second dissertation gave leave to publish it with his name the author of the third dissertation wrote concerning his piece that he had but two days to spare from a particular hurry of business in his profession to prepare it in and that so far from thinking it disgraced by being the third best he would have rejoiced for the honor of the seminary in which he received his first education if all the other six had been superior also and that if there were any observations in it which had not occurred to the other gentlemen or were likely to serve as hints for abler pens to set so important a subject in a proper light he readily consented to its publication but requested for particular reasons that his name might not be annexed to it  the fourth little piece is the production of an ingenious son of the college in his own easy unpremeditated way he has by many compositions done honor to the place of his education and by this which was only the sudden work of a few hours of that day in which the other pieces were under examination he meant not to come in competition for the prize but only to throw his mite into the general stock after his departure to england some of his friends having desired it to be published with the three first pieces it was accordingly annexed and had any of the authors of the other five remaining pieces or their friends made the like request they would have been indulged in it indeed most of them would have well deserved to be laid before the public had we not been afraid that the repetition of many of the same sentiments which must unavoidably run through them all on the same subject would at length become tiresome to the reader  we have only now to mention the occasion of the following eulogium by your own proposal as well as by order of the trustees of the college the medal was to be conferred at a public commencement wherefore at the commencement may  0th      immediately after the valedictory oration the hon john penn esquire governor of the province as president of the trustees of the college delivered the medal to the provost ordering him to confer it in public agreeable to their previous determination the provost accordingly acquainted the audience that the same had been decreed to john morgan md frs etc and professor of the theory and practice of physic in the college of philadelphia and then requested dr morgan to deliver his dissertation in public which being finished the eulogium accompanied the conferring of the medal  an eulogium on the delivery of mr sargents prizemedal at the public commencement in the college of philadelphia may      by william smith d d provost of that college published by desire sir as the reward of your great merit in this elegant performance i am in the name of the trustees and faculty of this college as well as in behalf of the worthy donor to beg your acceptance of this gold medal  its intrinsic value may not be an object of much consideration to you but the truly honorable circumstances by which it now becomes yours must render it one of the most valuable jewels in your possession  adorned though you have been with honors in distant lands yet we trust those will not be the least acceptable to you which your native country bestows  that the first literary prize contended for in this institution should fall to the share of one of its eldest sons who to much genius and application has joined much knowledge of the world will not seem strange yet still for the honor of the seminary and what will not derogate from your honor it will appear that you have obtained this preeminence over no mean competitors  some of our younger sons among whom we ought not to omit the name of the modest and candid author of the second of the following dissertations watts with some others even of inferior standing have exhibited such vigorous efforts of genius and tread so ardently on the heels of you and others their seniors that it will require the utmost exertion of all your faculties the continual straining of every nerve if you would long wish to lead the way to them in the great career of fame  o noble contest o happy seat of science to behold such a divine emulation among thy sons kindled by the ardent desire of glory and supported on those liberal principles which true literature alone can inspire  much do we owe to you gentlemen on this occasion much every way  much for the pains you have taken to do honor to the pace of your education and much for the public testimony you have given in its favor declaring that here you have imbibed the true principles of liberty and have learned from your early see dr morgans dissertation who was one of the first graduates youth that your head your heart and your hand should ever be at the service of your country   true it is gentlemen that we have publicly inculcated  and it was our duty to inculcate on you that these quotations are from a charge delivered by the author of this eulogium to the first class of graduates in the college of philadelphia may   th      dr morgan was one of this class if there be any thing on this earth suited to the native dignity of the human mind and worthy of contention it must be to assert the cause of religion and truth to support the fundamental rights and liberties of mankind and to strive for the constitution of your country and a government by known laws freely consented to by yourselves or your certain delegates  we have exhorted you when your country calls to be all eye and ear and heart and voice and hand in a cause so glorious proceeding with a manly and intrepid spirit with a fervent and enlightened zeal fearless of danger undaunted by opposition and convincing the world that liberty is your unconquerable delight and that you are sworn foes to every species of bondage either of body or of mind  but however much it might have been our duty to deliver lessons of this kind small would have been the honor we should have derived from them if you gentlemen had not nobly called those lessons forth into action demonstrating by your living example that the education you received in this place was not a mere art of furnishing the head but a true discipline of the life and manners  truly delicate and difficult we confess was the subject prescribed to you  to treat of the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual union between great britain and her american colonies at a time when a fatal misunderstanding had untwisted all the cords of that union and the minds of many were too much inflamed this difficulty was likewise increased to us by other considerations  great britain who by her liberality had raised this college from a helpless to a flourishing state had an undoubted demand on us in our particular capacity for all the returns of gratitude yet we could not we durst not divert the streams of learning from their sacred course our country nay all america had a right to demand that those streams should be directed pure along to water the goodly tree of liberty nor ever be suffered to cherish any foul weed that would choke its growth  in this most difficult conjuncture we rejoice to behold you in your early youth exercising all the temper and prudence of the most experienced patriots freely and dutifully acknowledging in behalf of the mother country that see dissertation third as the design of colonizing was not to found a new empire but to extend the old the colonies owe obedience under all constitutional and legal restrictions and a due subordination in all commercial purposes yet firmly asserting in behalf of the colonies that they are entitled in return to the full and free enjoyment of british liberty and necessary protection from all external violence  and that a policy which would ensure a small immediate revenue at the expense of a great though indirect national gain is mean and sordid unworthy of the generous enterprizing spirit of a commercial nation and radically destructive of the mutual confidence  we rejoice that ever we had the least share in forming sentiments like these which have led you to draw the true line and powerfully to show that on the everlasting basis of reciprocal interest and a participation of constitutional privleges and on this alone our union shall be perpetuated and our see mr wattss dissertation bleeding wounds healed up without so much as a scar by way of remembrance  here you have shown yourselves entitled to the name of true sons of liberty  sons of liberty indeed neither betraying her sacred cause on the one hand nor degenerating into licentiousness on the other   the occasion now calls me to address a few things to you gentlemen who have just received your degrees in this seminary but i would not trespass on the patience of this candid audience  you have observed the honors to which literary merit and integrity of principles have already advanced those who have gone before you in their studies here and you cannot but be sensible that of all the glories reflected on this institution we judge those the most solid and transporting which we derive from our own sons  the time is fast approaching and i trust your bosoms now glow for it when you too shall in your turn have an opportunity of doing honor to your education by your conduct in public life when that time shall come educated as you have been in the principles of sound liberty permit us to promise ourselves that you will ever think it your glory to be enlisted under her banners and to follow her exalted call  what we have often given in solemn charge to those who have gone before you and what you have often heard delivered in the course of your studies here is i hope engraven on your memories and need not now be repeated  you will consider all arts all sciences all eloquence all philosophy as intended to discipline the soul for eternity and so far as they center not ultimately in this grand view they are at best but empty trifles always look on the scriptures of god as that master system of knowledge by which all other wisdom is to be regulated and perfected  in whatever station of life you are we hope you never will forget your obligations to this seminary which will travail as it were in pain for you till you appear on the theater of action with dignity and will expect to find its own children and sons at least among the number of its friends  we wish you every felicity and bid you farewell   and here i ought to conclude  but the joyous occasion calls me to return particular thanks to this splendid audience for the countenance they have given us this day and to congraulate them on the glorious and happy turn in the affairs of america whereof yesterday the account of the repeal of the american stampact was received at philadelphia the day before the delivery of this elogium viz may         gave us the certain and confirmed accounts  when i look back on the dreadful state of suspense in which these colonies have been so long agitated when in the room of foreboding doubt and painful solicitude i behold joy in every look the clouds dispersed the sun breaking in upon us again and an assembly around me in which every man rejoices to salute his neighbor as free  i feel i feel a sympathy unutterable and an exultation of soul never felt before  o glorious day o happy america if now we but know how to prize our happiness  the unguarded sallies of intemperate zeal will soon be forgotten but the steadfast the noble the patriotic efforts of cool and good men in the vindication of native and constitutional rights will more and more claim the regard of all the free in every clime and age and perhaps be consecrated by time into one of the brightest transactions of our story asserting our pedigree and showing that we were worthy of having been descended from the illustrious stock of britons  the cause of liberty civil and religious is the cause of britain herself  nay it is the cause of heaven and it was with inexpressible satisfaction that i beheld more than one of the gentlemen who have written on the ties of union between great britain and her colonies deriving a very capital argument from the ties of a common religion  when i review the history of the world and look on the progress of knowledge freedom arts and sciences i cannot but be strongly persuaded that heaven has yet glorious purposes to serve through america  civil liberty the protestant religion the principles of toleration in their purity honorable as they are to human nature subsist but in few places of the globe and great britain is their principal residence  under her auspices they were transplanted into america where they have got firm root and are flourishing into immense growth and will bring such an accession of strength to the general cause of liberty and protestantism that we trust no power on earth shall ever be able to prevail against their united strength  this sentiment it is hoped will more and more gain ground among good men both here and in the mother country convincing them that to check the spirit of freedom or discourage the propagation of knowledge here in america would on the part of great britain be to wound her own members and weaken or destroy that glorious public system of truth freedom and happiness whereof she is the guardian and the head  animated by these principles and guided by an enlightened zeal it will become us to manifest our gratitude and love to the mother country by every means in our power let us make our moderation known to all the world bending our whole thoughts to a virtuous industry beneficial to ourselves and to great britain acting as free but not using our liberty as a cloak of maliciousness or of licentioussness  dissertation on the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual union between great britain and her american colonies for which mr sargents prizemedal was adjudged to john morgan m d f r s etc and professor of the theory and practice of physic in the college of philadelphia  to john sargent esquire member of parliament etc this essay as a small testimony of gratitude for many personal favors received and from a due sense of his accurate judgment and public spirit manifested as well in the choice of the subject for the following performance as in the polite and generous manner in which he proposed it is most humbly inscribed by his much obliged most obedient and very humble servant  john morgan  dissertation i on the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual union between great britain and her american colonies never has the cause of liberty employed the pen of any of her votaries upon a subject of greater importance to britain and her colonies introduction than the reciprocal advantages of which a perpetual union between them must necessarily be productive to investigate these advantages and to place them in a clear and conspicuous point of view requires much skill and ingenuity and affords ample scope for a vigorous exertion of the brightest genius assisted and improved by the most extensive literature a competent knowledge of the great and fundamental principles of government of the nature of the british constitution the particular rights and privileges of the several colonies together with the history of their produce trade and commerce is indispensably necessary to such an undertaking  unequal as i am to the arduous task motives for this undertaking and trembling lest the subject should suffer under my unpractised hand i have been almost tempted to decline it but when i consider myself at once as a briton and an american and reflect upon the invaluable privileges and benefits to which in both these characters and capacities i am so happy as to be entitled every apprehension vanishes an honest confidence takes place and i venture to deliver my sentiments rude and unpolished as they are upon this interesting theme depending for success upon that love of liberty and that warm zeal for my countrys welfare with which my bosom does and i trust will always glow it is this alone gives me reason to hope for that candor from my dear countrymen to which i am well convinced my poor abilities can lay no claim  but i have an additional incentive to this undertaking for i am called to it further motive as the son of an institution wherein i imbibed the true principles of liberty and was taught to admire the beauty and excellency of that civil constitution in which the governing powers mutually control and are controuled by each other in which the rights of prince and people are accurately discriminated and liberty and property effectually secured by a government of laws not of men in which civil and religious rights and privileges are held sacred and inviolable and declared to be no less the birthright of the meanest subject in the most distant and obscure corner of the realm than of the highest courtier that basks in the sunshine of royal favor  this british american seminary which was founded upon these principles and is careful to transmit them pure and uncorrupted to all her children is justly entitled to a greater tribute from me than i have it in my power to pay she has often inculcated this lesson upon my youth that my head my hand and my heart should be at the service of my country my head and my hand perhaps may fail of rendering her such assistances as she receives from better heads and abler hands but the present occasion will at least enable me to show that i have an heart as deeply interested in my countrys welfare as any of her sons it is upon this principle alone that i stand a candidate for the honors which are now proposed to the best dissertation on the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual union between great britain and her colonies  in treating of this important subject the plan of treating the subject was i to enter upon a full and complete enumeration of all these advantages i should doubtless exceed the limits usually prescribed to performances of this nature the principal arguments that i shall advance in favor of this perpetual union shall be derived from one or other of these two sources  first from a consideration of the nature and extent of the commerce that subsists between great britain and her colonies and the amazing increase of riches and power which they reciprocally derive from that commerce  secondly from the glorious prospect of the advancement of the protestant religion which they profess and spreading the gospel in its purity through the vast benighted regions of this western world  but a full discussion of the several arguments to be drawn even from these two sources would require a volume instead of a short dissertation i shall therefore confine myself chiesly to those which may be drawn from the first source and only touch upon the second in the close of the performance  in the first place then a general view of the present state of the colonies if we do but take a general view of the present flourishing condition of the colonies and reflect upon the very small beginnings from which they have rose in so short a time to such a height as now renders them the richest jewel in the crown of britain if we consider the figure that new england new york the jerseys pennsylvania maryland virginia and carolina make at this day compared with the state of these countries in the hands of their original proprietors if we attend a little to the amazing increase of their inhabitants their products and exports the prodigious quantities of manufactures they take off from england and the balance of trade which she obtains from their commodities the shipping this commerce requires the seamen it raises the mouths it feeds the hands it employs and the accumulated wealth which it brings to thousands nay millions of subjects we cannot but be fully convinced of the vast importance and advantage of a perpetual union between great britain and her american colonies  can the warmest imagination form to itself an idea of aught more sublime and delightful their great improvement than those happy effects which commerce and the full enjoyment of civil and religious liberty have so suddenly produced in countries which were not long since the dreary haunts of savage beasts and savage men where ignorance and barbarity frowned over the uncultivated earth gay fields now smile bedecked in the yellow robe of fulleared harvest cities rise majestic to the view fleets too crowd the capacious harbor with their swelling canvas and swarms of cheerful inhabitants cover the shore with monuments of their industry through a long tract of two thousand miles  from this general view of the amazing ncrease of our american colonies a detail of the subject i naturally proceed to a particular detail of the advantages which are derived from them to the mother country  certain it is advantages of planting colonies that nothing can contribute more to the flourishing state of any trading nation than the establishing of settlements in foreign parts experience evinces the truth of this their american plantations heretofore rendered the portuguese and spaniards rich and powerful and these are now not only the greatest and constant but almost the only source of their wealth nor have either the french or dutch been inattentive to this important object witness the settlements of the latter in the east indies which by their application to commerce under the blessings of a moderate government in a few score years from the low and distressed states of holland rendered them high and mighty witness the efforts which france made the last war for the conquest of america a prize worthy to be contended for by the most powerful nations the city of tire whose merchants were as princes and her great men the honorable of the earth was like great britain situated upon an island and like great britain maintained the dominion of the sea by her commerce the principal seat of her trade and great source of her wealth was the noble colony of carthage which she founded the power and naval strength of which was carried to such a height by means of commerce that forty years were spent by the romans before they were able to subdue this mighty people preceptor vol   on trade and commerce   to a nation situated on an island particularly to great britain as great britain is accommodated with every convenience for trade the establishing of foreign plantations to promote her commerce is particularly beneficial since the inhabitants have no other way of conveying abroad their product and manufactures but by navigation which breeds seamen and brings in wealth to maintain them this renders england considerable by her fleets respected by her allies and the scourge of her enemies such hands therefore as are employed for those useful purposes deserve all kind of encouragement for on the pillars of her commerce depend the safety and strength of england  one of the most considerable advantages therefore one of the most considerable which great britain derives from her american colonies arises from their supplying her with commodities of her own whereby a vast treasure is saved to the nation which would otherwise be spent in foreign kingdoms  in north america natural advantages of america we have almost every kind of climate as well as soil to the extent of seven hundred leagues or upwards on the seacoast from north to south these lands are capable of the greatest improvement by cultivation they yield some of the most valuable commodities for trade and such as are in the highest demand in other countries such as cotton silk indigo rice and great quantities of all kinds of corn of the best quality and the number of commodities might be easily augmented vines are natural to many parts of the country a variety of medicinal drugs gums and plants is not wanting flax for linen and hemp for cordage are brought here to very great perfection the woods yield materials for ships houses and cabinet work the pine trees will furnish a plenty of masts and yards with pitch turpentine tar and rosin the woods also abound in game furs and all sorts of peltry are furnished from hence in the bowels of the earth there are mines of iron copper and coal in great abundance there are various sorts of useful earths for bricks and tiles and a variety of useful stones for building lastly north america has spacious and safe harbors for shipping and navigable rivers variously intersect the country to facilitate the communication from one part to the other  now if the planting of colonies is so beneficial to a commercial people its conveniences for settling of colonies if these are more especially advantageous to an island surrounded with ports and where every inle may prove a convenient harbor and if a country abounding with useful commodities blessed with a fertile soil and a variety of healthy climates is particularly calculated for the planting growth and increase of colonies we may readily conclude that the settlement of the british american colonies must have proved of the utmost advantage to great britain nor is such a conclusion void  foundation as we shall be fully convinced b comparing the present condition of england with what it was whilst yet she had no plantations  before that period condition of england before she had any colonies it is computed that the people of london did not exceed one sixth part of their present number england was then obliged to pay to foreigners for all the commodities she now gets from america at a most exorbitant price and now exports those very goods to the very same nations from which she was wont to get them it is ingeniously observed by an able pen that rum sugar and tobacco if we had no plantations would prove so many issues to drain us of our circulating cash which are now the sources of private wealth and the public revenue  at the time when queen elizabeth entered upon her government in queen elizabeths reign the customs produced but thirtysix thousand pounds a year a sum far less than what one of her colonies now brings into the treasury the legal interest of money was then at    per cent it is now but   and england abounds in riches her shipping too is increased to the most astonishing degree in the year      queen elizabeths time the whole royal navy consisted but twentyfour ships and all the shipping then in england both great and small fell short of eight hundred fail a number not equal to half the vessels which are employed at this time to carry on the commerce of america according to an abstract made about thirty years ago see the preceptor on trade and commerce vol   the royal navy consisted of three hundred and twentytwo sail carrying twelve thousand two hundred and seventy pieces of cannon and since that time has been continually increasing if the whole royal navy had been in commission at the end of the last war and manned to its full compliment it could not have amounted to much less than one hundred thousand seamen  although the manufactures of england are the colonies are useful in taking off the manufactures of great britain within a very few years prodigiously augmented the plantations alone take off near one half by their consumption of english manufactures great are the advantages which redound to great britain from her empire in america the plantation trade is by far the most valuable of any whereof england can boast the enjoyment what we may place great stress upon it is continually improving it is a mine in which we still find richer and nobler veins whilst other springs of commerce are drying up this overflows it is permanent whilst others are shifting place what crowns its value it is our own in which other nations cannot rival england nor can they deprive her of it  great as the present product of our trade is the american trade may be rendered still more beneficial it might be made much more beneficial as it is computed by intelligent writers that above a million annually might be saved or added to the stock by a proper encouragement of many articles that might be raised in america by the purchase of them abroad we contribute to enrich other nations who extort very exorbitant sums from us and who have it in their power to disappoint us of them perhaps when they become most necessary to us  seeing then it is impolitic to import american commodities from other nations from the preceding account of the colonies england may be supplied from thence with some of the most valuable commodities such as raw silk from georgia for her own manufactures hemp for cordage iron for various arts a great abundance of naval stores of all kinds from pennsylvania carolina new jersey new york and new england as planks timber masts yards and all materials for shipbuilding it is a reflection on our politics to expend our money with other nations for these articles for hemp indeed exported from the plantations a bounty has lately been allowed by parliament from which england will unquestionably derive great benefit to herself the same encouragement will produce the same good effect in regard to iron and potashes a bourty allowed on these articles though inconsiderable must soon be reimbursed manifold by saving vast sums of money yearly remitted to foreigners for these commodities  the bounty allowed upon pitch pitch tar and turpentine tar and turpentine has brought the price of these commodities in england to ten shillings sterling a barrel which used to amount to fifty shillings for which too was paid ready money this regulation therefore prevents five time the sum of its cost from going out of the kingdom to sweden and other northern power and aids the colonies to make returns for the immense quantity of goods sent to them from england the above articles now come so cheap to the shipbuilders of great britain that the charge is hardly felt by them and the bounty that is paid by the nation on the importation of those commodities is doubly repaid by lessening the proportion between the importation and exportation that was against us in these articles which is called the balance of trade introduction to the british empire in america it is agreed by all who pretend to understand trade balance of trade what says judge littleton that a country does then grow rich and then only when the commodities exported out of it are of more value than those that are imported into it judge littletons treatise on the groans of the plantations it is but wisdom therefore in britain to encourage the raising of every commodity in america of which she stands in need herself or which may increase the balance of trade in her favor  and here we may properly take notice of the considerable advantages derived from an interchange of manufactures and commodities between great britain and america benefits of an interchange of manufactures and commodities the labor that is necessary in manufactures the expenfive carriage and different hands they pass through must greatly heighten their value whilst commodities generally employ but one set of people manufactures employ many they afford a subsistence to the poor collect people into villages extend the buildings of towns and cities improve the soil enhance the property of landlords and create a considerable intercourse between artificers and merchants value of the manufactures from the hands they pass through the consumers of english woolen manufactures in america are obliged to pay about    per cent advance on the first cost by way of profit to the different hands which these manufactures pass through before they arrive to them viz to the woolstapler the clothier the woolen draper the merchants in england and america for freight and insurance and to the retailer this calculation is made by an ingenious and intelligent merchant of philadelphia well versed in this subject whence it appears that manufactures are not more valuable in themselves than from the number of persons they support  hence it follows likewise the export of american commodities recommended that while great britain is employed in manufactures america ought to be encouraged in raising all sorts of commodities and exporting them to britain by which means the mother country will be supplied with materials for carrying on her manufactures and the colonies be enabled to purchase those manufactures of which they stand in need and thus they will become reciprocally necessary to each other  it is judged the trrade of america with england that the whole trade of america to all parts of the globe employs one year with another above two thousand sail of english ships by which treasures of greater wealth are conveyed to britain than are derived from mexico or peru the amount of the cash and bills of exchange and of the commodities sent to england in payment for her goods and of the duties on these commodities cannot be less than two millions yearly from the commodities of america chiefly manufactured in england and conveyed through innumerable channels of trade to every quarter of the globe great britain acquires immense wealth keeps up a spirit of industry among her inhabitants and is enabled to support mighty fleets great in peace and formidable in war  but further the american colonies advantageous to britain in time of war the american colonies are not only very beneficial to the trade of britain in time of peace but are highly advantageous to her in case of war with france or spain the most common and natural enemies of britain the very situation of the british islands in america renders it easy to annoy those of the french or spaniards the continental colonies too on an emergency are able to furnish many thousand brave men who when joined by any body of regular forces from england and convoyed by a british squadron would effectually shake the french and spanish dominions both in north and southamerica this has been done and may be done again when any future provocation calls them to unite their force with that of britain against their common enemy thus it appears i think with the highest degree of evidence that britain owes much of her wellbeing her riches and her power to her american colonies it is from her union with them she draws the sinews of war whereby she is enabled to conquer and prescribe terms of peace to her enemies and to fix her glory upon a sure and lasting basis  but if from what has been said it is the interest of the american colonies to perpetuate their union with great britain it appears to be the interest of britain to perpetuate her union with her colonies in america it will appear no less manifest by the sequel that it is the interest of those colonies to perpetuate their union with britain  the american colonies proved from the support and commerce of england by the support and commerce of britain have emerged as it were out of darkness into light and in less than two centuries have become a numerous and happy people between two and three millions at least of subjects by transplantation from europe and by natural increase now inhabit these colonies for this increase of numbers wealth and power they are indebted originally to britain from whence they derived their mild government their equal laws and secure property must they not then naturally desire a perpetual union with their mother country whilst they taste the sweets of british liberty and enjoy the advantages of her trade and commerce  and this leads me to mention another reason why the colonies should wish to perpetuate their union with britain the demand for british manufactures viz the considerable benefit which they derive from the british manufactures the price of labor in america is too great to allow the inhabitants to manufacture for themselves they supply all their wants from britain and are enabled to make good remittances by their commodities which might otherwise lie useless on their hands  again and the advantageous alliance  america  great britain were the american colonies to be considered as having no union or connection with britain what power could secure them from her conquering arm whenever she was disposed to stretch it forth but while the union is perpetuated between them and the colonies are considered as a part of the british empire britain surely by her formidable fleets and brave and disciplined armies could afford them speedy succor in the day of danger and effectually secure them from the hostile attempts of any power in europe i ask once more then must not the colonies naturally desire a perpetual union with their mother country since it is from her they enjoy the sweets of british liberty the advantages of british commerce and the protection of british power  i have said the less of the importance of great britain to the american colonies an erroneous principle considered because this is a subject upon which every writer seems to be agreed whereas there have been some narrow shortsighted politicians who have attempted to diminish the importance of the colonies to great britain it is for this reason that i have entered upon a more minute detail of the latter and have moreover subjoined to the end of this dissertation an appendix containing a summary view of the american commerce the produce and exports of the several colonies whereby the national stock is so considerably augmented  thus have i endeavored to point out the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual union between great britain and her colonies conclusions to be drawn from this view of commerce from a particular view of the nature and extent of the commerce that subsists between them and the vast accessions of wealth and power which they reciprocally derive from that commerce i have shown how necessary they are to one another and that they must suffer and decline in proportion as the present union betwixt them is weakened or destroyed i have only to add further under this head a few observations upon the most probable methods of preserving and perpetuating this union  with respect to great britain the surest means of preserving this union considered on the part of great britain i think the surest method she can take to preserve this union inviolate is to consider the interests of america as her own to encourage the willing obedience of a dutiful and loyal people by equal laws and a free and open commerce rather than attempt by unequal laws and too severe restrictions to force an unwilling subjection the balance of trade will return more clear money from the american colonies than can be extorted from them either by armies taxes or tribute it is more safe as well as virtuous to accept the chaste embraces of conjugal affection than by violence to extort forbidden pleasures which commonly fail the expectations catos letters   it is an illjudged policy impolitic restrictions of trade therefore which would prevent the colonies from enriching themselves by trade at the expense of their neighbors for these are only the channels through which the riches of foreign nations are poured into the coffers of britain and if these channels are once dried up the watchful enemies and rivals of britain would soon avail themselves of our errors commerce once forced from her wonted course is seldom or never brought into it again foreigners would soon usurp our trade and thrive in proportion as we decline  to secure the liberty and property of all its subjects is or ought to be what is or ought to be the end of government and common standard of action the end of every government so long as this end is kept in view so long are the people united by the firmest bond of society the interest of the whole this end must be the common standard by which the particular actions of the several members toward each other ought to be regulated particular ranks of men have particular feelings peculiar to themselves and often contrary to the interests and feelings of the rest of the society and therefore have no right to make and much less to impose laws on their fellow subjects inconsistent with and opposite to those interests and those seelings therefore a society government or real public must consist of freemen choosing or consenting to laws themselves to watch over such a system and to promote its good as much as lies in our power to resist every encroachment on it and to defend it to the utmost is the political duty of every citizen see preceptor vol   on ethics but to sacrifice the interests of one part to those of another part weakens the affection of subjects inasmuch as the preservation of our rights the security of our persons liberties and property on the one hand and obedience to government on the other hand are the reciprocal duties of the rulers and ruled  if the superstructure of a government be raised on any other foundation than the general interest of the whole community viz the general interest of the whole community it can not be durable like the image of daniels vision the head whereof was of fine gold the belly and thighs of brass the legs of iron and the feet part of iron and part of clay which cannot cleave together it must when smote upon be broken to pieces but the constitution of a country in which the happiness of the whole community is regarded is like a firm oak that withstands the fury of the jarring elements roused up into a storm fixes its roots deeper in its native earth and lifts its majestic head to the skies whilst this principle is kept up in its full vigor it will endure the shocks of contending nations and be still more firmly established it will yield to naught but time before which the sun himself shall fail and nature sink in years  when the public is safe and trade encouraged which is the happiness and support of a country every man participates of the common felicity and has means of acquiring property the riches of a good king consist in the wealth of his subjects the affections of his people are his security and happiness all they possess their fortune and property are at his disposal because they are employed to secure both him and themselves a wise government ought therefore to secure the possession of property and raise no taxes but what they shall see a real necessity for doing and continue them no longer than that necessity requires it should be done in a manner most agreeable to the sentiments of the people who best know what they can endure for a virtuous and public spirit a spirit of liberty is the chief if not the only support of a country see catos letters on the subject of liberty   should any ignorant or selfish politicians in the mother country ever have influence enough to get such laws enacted an opposite conduct in what respect pernicious as would bear hard upon the liberty or property of the colonies this measure would doubtless have a natural tendency to sow the seeds of discontent among them and to alienate their affections instead of considering britain then as connected with them by the natural ties of a mother country they would begin to look upon her as a foreign power treating them as her tributaries and attempting to enslave them for the same noble spirit of freedom which actuates an englishman born in the island of britain beats in every pulse and pants in every breast of the british subjects in america add to this the colonies were settled upon a presumption that the same extensive privileges which were originally granted to them should not in aftertimes be contracted or withdrawn when great britain has attained to such a pitch of grandeur by the industry and success of her colonies as has rendered her the admiration and envy of her neighbors would it be consistent with the maxims of justice for her to resume the privileges she has granted under which they have so amazingly flourished and which they have never forfeited no the rights of americans are established on the same foundation with those of britain herself she cannot violate them without at the same time undermining her own constitution and the same sword that is sheathed in the bowels of america must inevitably pierce the vitals of britain too far other returns however may be hoped for by a people whose commerce has proved so beneficial to britain who have at the expense of so much treasure and so much blood assisted her in gaining a complete ascendency over their common enemy they are a people too who contributed much by their bravery in a former war to procure an honorable and unlooked for peace to their mother country when she was of herself in no condition to prescribe her own terms the island of capebreton which was esteemed the dunkirk of america was taken by the troops of new england with little or no assistance from home and this was all the english had to restore to france at the treaty of aix la chapelle      for the restitution of bergen opzoom to her allies and for other terms of peace   thus it appears a violation of the american rights impolitic that the most effectual method which great britain can take to perpetuate her union with the colonies is to continue them in the full exercise of those liberties and privileges both with respect to commerce and taxes which they have hitherto enjoyed and to do nothing that can justly be looked upon as a violation of their rights which might end in a breach of this desirable union  with respect to the colonies the method by which the colonies may preserve the present union the surest method they can take to preserve inviolate their union with britain is upon every occasion to demonstrate their loyalty to the best of kings and their subordination to the government of great britain by exerting their united efforts in the support and defense of the dignity of the british crown and the rights of the british parliament and by cheerfully and constantly submitting to the just determination of the grand council of the realm a conduct opposite to this would make them forfeit the rights of sons and justly bring upon them the indignation and chastisement of the mother country  these are the methods the effects of such a conduct which to me appear most likely to perpetuate the glorious union between great britain and her colonies which will ensure strength and success to the common cause and baffle every attempt of their enemies to injure or molest them thus will the commerce riches and power of britain be carried to an envied pitch of greatness and as far surpass what they now are as they do at this day exceed what they were before great britain could boast of a colony  i have enlarged so much upon the advantages of a perpetual union between great britain and her colonies benefits of this union to religion and the protestant interest collected from a view of the nature and extent of the commerce that subsists between them and the immense accession of riches and power which they reciprocally enjoy from that commerce that i can now say but little of the glorious prospect which this union presents to us in the promotion of the protestant religion which they profess and extending the gospel in its purity throughout the vast benighted regions of the western world  this consideration is indeed as far superior to that which i have hitherto dwelt upon superior to that of mere commerce etc as things eternal are to those of a mere temporal nature one relates to the greatest of this worlds good even liberty and property the other extends to a future and eternal world and is employed upon such objects as are most likely to secure the happy enjoyment of it it is the glory of britain that she enjoys both these advantages in the highest degree that the means of preserving the former is secured to her by the best civil constitution and the means of obtaining the latter by the best religious establishment in the world  with the sons of britain the protestant religion was transplanted into the colonies by the spreading of the gospel it has taken root grown and flourished in the kindly soil it has already become a fair and lofty tree and if it is still well nurtured and sufficiently watered it may ever long extend its boughs beyond the setting sun even to the verge of the eastern world and perhaps shelter the native country from whence it originally sprung thus britain has already been an happy instrument in the hands of heaven of bearing the tidings of the gospel to one of the darkest corners of the globe to nations who had long sat in darkness and the shadow of death by perpetuating an union with her colonies she may likewise through them carry these glad tidings further still even to the utmost ends of the earth and thus hasten if i may so speak that glorious period when righteousness shall overflow the earth as the waters cover the seas and when all the kingdoms of the world shall become the kingdoms of the lord and of his christ  if such then are to be the happy consequences of this glorious union conclusion should not every american every british protestant ardently wish and pray that it may be faithfully and inviolably preserved and continued as long as the sun and moon endure  appendix containing a general view of the trade of the american colonies their produce exports etc chiefly extracted from approved histories and authentic memoirs in this appendix to observe some order i shall begin with an account of the british settlements to the northward and first with newfoundland this great island which is above three hundred miles long and two hundred broad forms the eastern boundary of the gulf of st lawrence and extends from thence southward near ten degrees of latitude along the eastward part of nova scotia it is chiefly valuable for the great fishery upon those shoals newfoundland its fishery which are called the banks of newfoundland the plenty of cod and several other species of fish here is almost inconceivable as well as along the shores of the island of capebreton the coasts nova scotia and new england which pours in a treasure of riches on great britain our share of the newfoundland fishery was formerly computed to increase the national stock at least three hundred thousand pounds sterling a year in gold and silver remitted for the cod we sell in the different parts of europe in spain portugal italy and the levant etc see account of european settlements in america by dodsley of how much more wealth must it be productive at present to the mother country as newfoundland and nova scotia belong now so entirely to great britain the advantages which attend an extensive and wellmanaged fishery are great and obvious the sea may be considered as a mine out of which the treasure is taken at a very little expense and even that expense is advantageous since it promotes several manufactures and goes entirely amongst our own people fish is a valuable commodity both at home and abroad according to some writers the dutch make more of their fishery in our seas than the spaniards do by the west indies besides this fishery properly attended to would infalliably furnish us with a constant supply of experienced active and healthy sailors for manning our fleets the gradual increase of which would prove not only a constant and inexhaustible source of wealth and add to the balance of trade in our favor but augment our maritime force to a degree that would make us a match for all europe in naval power preceptor   adjacent to newfoundland is the country of nova scotia which nova scotia although the progress of it was at first but slow is now become a considerable settlement and is a very advantageous place for fishing twentyfive thousand quintals of fish have been caught there in one year british empire in america   but much more considerable is the colony of new england new england this colony is in length near three hundred miles and in some part near two hundred miles in breadth lying between the fortyfirst and fortyfifth degrees of north latitude and comprizes the four provinces of massachusetts bay connecticut rhode island and new hampshire  there is a noble codfishery on this coast its fishery which employs a vast number of their people and proves a very considerable article of trade they are enabled by this to export annually above thirty thousand quintals of choice codfish to spain italy and the mediterranean and near twenty thousand quintals of the refuse sort to the west indies as food for the negroes besides a large quantity to madeira and fyal for wines and brandy  the business of shipbuilding is one of the most considerable which boston its tiade or the other seaport towns in new england carry on this country has materials enough to build ships for half the employment of britain it can furnish the trade and navy too with naval stores for the supplies of which from the baltic two or three hundred thousand pounds sterling annually was wont to be expended in their trade to foreign parts the profits of their voyage are generally received in bills of exchange upon london or in returns of goods through the hands of english factors by this circuitous commerce they pay in great britain for various sorts of goods got from thence to the amount of some hundred thousand pounds sterling a year although their commerce is not carried on immediately with great britain nor with british vessels yet here the profits chiefly center where all the money which the colonies can make in any manner must center at last potashes a most necessary article in manufactures particularly in bleaching as many thousand barrels are annually consumed for this one purpose in ireland have within these few years proved a very advantageous article of trade in several of the colonies particularly in new england and is likely to become a very valuable and growing remittance to the mother country the amount of the potashes exported home from new england only within the last twelve months is said to be not less than thirty thousand pounds sterling and it is imagined that the quantity this year will arise to a much more considerable sum the spirit of gain which the making of potashes has already inspired it is probable will every year continue to render this manufacture an object of much greater importance to america than has been generally imagined near six hundred sail of ships have been laden in a year for europe and the british plantations from christmas      to christmas      five hundred vessels cleared out from the port of boston only for a foreign trade and four hundred and thirty were entered inwards great is the advantage therefore of the new england trade and navigation if only considered as a nursery of seamen how much more by considering the addition it makes to the national stock history of the british empire in america   the three contigious provinces new york new jersey and pennsylvania their trade viz new york new jersey and pennsylvania to the southward of new england are with very little difference the same in their climate productions and the commodities in which they trade the soil being in general very fertile abounding not only in its native grain the indian corn but few parts of the world exceed these provinces in the abundance and excellence of their wheat barley rye oats buckwheat etc  great quantities of flax and hemp are raised in these provinces mines of iron have been opened in them all and a rich mine of copper has been successfully worked in eastjersey which may prove highly advantageous to the manufactures of great britain the trade of these provinces to the west indies is very considerable in provisions hides tallow lumber and soap etc for which they can procure sugars and from this find some resource of making remittance to england for the goods they get from thence they carry on a trade also with spain portugal italy madeira and fyal they trade likewise to england and ireland in hemp flaxseed linseed oil furs and deerskins flaxseed is a very promising article of commerce as ireland must be dependant on the american colonies for an annual supply in times of scarcity prodigious quantities of wheat are shipped to england and ireland as well as to other parts of europe thus the americans send home to their fellow subjects of great britain both goods to increase the national stock and also bread for their subsistence amongst the several acts which passed the house of commons and gained his majestys royal assent the last sessions of parliament is an act for allowing the importation of wheat from america duty free for a limited time the importations from england into the province of pennsylvania only it is estimated has in several years amounted to more than half a million sterling per annum memorial of the merchants and traders of the city of philadelphia   there cannot be less than seven or eight hundred sail of ships annually employed to keep up the extensive trade of these provinces  maryland and virginia trade of maryland and virginia which are to the southward of pennsylvania agree very much in their soil and product  tobacco is the standing commodity of both these colonies a late sensible writer computes that there are shipped from these places annually  0000 hogsheads of tobacco at an average of     weight each  0000 of these are expended in home consumption the duty of each is twentyseven pounds sterling and the amount of the whole duty on them is above eight hundred thousand pounds and of the remaining  0000 hogsheads after the imports and part of the subsidy are drawn back about onefifth of the sum is produced into the exchequer from every hogshead that is reexported which is above three hundred thousand pounds more the whole amount for the customs of tobacco is more than a million such is the immense advantage which the mother country derives from the article of tobacco alone which she gets from her colonies see considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes on the british colonies for raising a revenue by act of parliament and also a computation by sir thomas dally in the history of the british empire in america   north and south carolina north and south carolina to the southward of virginia lie between the thirtyfirst and thirtysixth degrees of north latitude in a very fine climate  the trade of carolina has three great staple commodities rice indigo and naval stores which it yields more abundantly than all the rest of our colonies rice anciently formed by itself the staple of carolina the export of this commodity from charlestown in the year      amounted only to       barrels in a few years afterward the product of it was computed to return to greatbritan at least l  0000 per annum including freight and commissions which are the most profitable articles in the british commerce in the year      the export of rice from charlestown amounted to  0     barrels in the year      this branch of commerce was computed to be annually worth at the lowest estimation l   0000 sterling great has been its increase since and we may well reckon it to be at this time worth l  00000 sterling  it was long before carolina went into the profitable trade of indigo they began it since the year    0 and in the year      was exported from charlestown to the amount of above  00000 lb weight and  00000 lb weight was made in the year      if the inhabitants continue to improve the advantages with the same spirit in which they have begun they must naturally and necessarily come to supply the whole consumption of the world with this commodity and consequently make their country the richest part of the british dominions see account of european settlements printed by dodsley   to the southward of carolina on the borders of florida georgia was erected the province of georgia in       georgia is of importance at present and will be of future benefit to england by raising raw silk the goodness of its silk has been tried by a proper engine and according to sir thomas lombe is better than the finest silk of piedmont for which half a million a year has been paid potashes too has been imported from hence to england besides peltry drugs and dyers ware of several sorts  we come next to the spanish settlement of st augustine to the southward of georgia st augustine it belongs now to the english as well as canada and louisiana by the last treaty of peace so that they claim the whole of north america upon the atlantic sea  we shall say nothing of the newly formed colonies in florida as being but yet in their infancy or of the settlements in hudsons bay as not very considerable hitherto but how great must be the advantage of trade with the indians in canada and louisiana now ceded to the english which encouraged and enabled the french to hem in all the english colonies by a chain of forts on their back settlements extended in a tract of above  000 miles see account of the british settlements in america and history of the british empire in america   canada borders to the northward upon the provinces of nova scotia new england and new york it is the oldest of all the french establishments and prior to the settlement of new england quebec is the capital of this province it is built on the river st lawrence upon which are the principal settlements of this colony a vast trade already is and a much greater may in time be carried on with the indians on the prodigious fresh water lakes of which there are five in number in extent to be considered as so many seas they communicate with one another and the last of them with the river st lawrence which effectually commands the trade of the lakes and has an influence upon all the nations of indians which confine upon them  the principal produce of the west indies is sugar of the west indies it is amazing what riches have been acquired to england by this commodity and what a surprizingly great number of ships are employed in the trade especially of barbados and jamaica this last place is of great consequence to annoy the enemy in time of war with france or spain no plate fleet from carthagena can arrive at the havannah which is the general place of rendezvous for the flota without passing by one end of jamaica whilst we continue masters of these seas we shall always have it in our power to prevent the junction and greatly distress them in time of peace the trade is of no less consequence in drawing from the spaniards great sums of money  if the sugar islands are of such consequence to england on account of the great trade shipping and number of hands employed the persons subsisted thereby and the customs and imposts they pay the importance of the colonies on the continent of north america is enhanced from their supplying the west indies with lumber and provisions of all sorts  in whatever light we view the connection between great britain and her american colonies conclusion the reciprocal advantages of the present union almost exceed computation and yet fall every way far short of those immense benefits which will accrue to both from this union being rendered firm and perpetual  end of the appendix an essay on the reciprocal advattages of a perpetual union between great britain and her american colonies  by stephen watts m a  advertisement to the reader the author is very sensible that it would have been proper in composing the following essay to have consulted with gentlemen who reside in the several places he had occasion to speak of and are well acquainted with the nature and extent of their commerce would the time allowed for these performances have affored him an opportunity of procuring such information he flatters himself his piece would have been more original with respect to matters of trade and more worthy of public notice he would have been thereby enabled to form a more exact estimate of the present state of trade in great britain and america deprived of this advantage he was obliged to have recourse to commercial writers amongst whom he is chiefly indebted to gee and beawes and when it is considered that few persons though of far greater abilities and experience in the commercial world than the author would be able of their own knowledge to furnish an adequate account of every material branch in the british and american trade he cannot despair of the readers indulgence  dissertation ii the situation of great britain separated from the rest of the world by the surrounding ocean and destitute of those endless resources which an extent of continent affords its inhabitants very early suggested to judicious and observing men that a naval force would be the easiest and most sure means of her defense against foreign encroachments the great alfred of glorious and immortal memory was fully convinced of this important truth he knew by sad experience that the want of such a force had subjected the island to the insults and depredations of the danes and other northern robbers animated with affection for his subjects and fired with a just resentment of the injuries they had received he resolved if possible to supply such a fatal defect by equipping with incredible expedition a fleet considerable in those days he rendered himself master of the sea and freed his people from the dread of being plundered but in a few years this beneficial this glorious project unsupported by a sufficient fund was almost entirely laid aside the inhabitants employed in the exercise of arms or agriculture and raising what was barely necessary for their own subsistence could not possibly defray the expense of having a fleet always in readiness the danes taking advantage of their remissness in this important affair soon overrun and subdued the greatest part of the island but inattentive to a lesson which their own success might have taught them they in their turn fell a prey to an innundation of normans  thus the british navy though several attempts were made to render it respectable by monarchs who understood their own interests continued nevertheless to make no great figure till the reign of queen elizabeth till this time also the trade of england was very small and contracted within a narrow compass it consisted chiefly in exporting tin lead wool and a few other articles which served to purchase what foreign goods were wanted that wise queen assisted by a wise and experienced ministry discovered the grand secret unknown to her predecessors they knew the advantages of a fleet but the consequent expenses they knew not how to defray an extensive commerce was now very judiciously considered as the only source adequate to such large and continual disbursements this it was thought would not only afford a supply of money sufficient to equip and maintain a powerful navy but would also be a school or nursery of seamen  on these considerations encouragement was given to the persecuted walloons to remove and settle in england they very willingly embraced an opportunity of transporting themselves to a land of freedom and brought with them the woollen manufactory which favored with the countenance and protection of a wise government soon arrived at great perfection in pursuance of the same plan a trade was opened to turkey muscovy the east indies and almost every considerable country in the known world under the auspices of the same queen plantations were begun in america and prosecuted with vigor they at first met with nearly insuperable difficulties nevertheless by the indefatigable industry and perseverance of the planters and the generous assistance of their mother country those difficulties were surmounted and the colonies brought to a pitch of greatness that considering the short time of their growth is almost incredible  i have taken this retrospect in order to show that the british trade the british navy and the british colonies in america sprung up together they are most nearly allied being children of the same good policy and it is worthy the notice and attention of every politician who studies to promote his countrys welfare that as they had their rise at the same time they have ever since continued to increase and flourish in proportion their dependence is mutual and if either of them be affected the others sooner or later will feel it in a very sensible manner  great has been my surprise at the ignorance or malevolence of several late productions the writers of them either blinded by passion or employed and instigated by the enemies of the british empire have endeavored to sow discord and dissension between the mother country and her american colonies some have strove to render the colonists suspected by representing them as an ungrateful licentious people aiming at independence and impatient of any subordination to great britain whilst others no less enemies to the welfare and prosperity of both would excite their jealousy by undervaluing the assistance she has offerded them and placing her in the light of a cruel stepmother  i am too well convinced of the good sense of my countrymen both of britain and america to imagine them capable of being deluded by such partial representations considering themselves as members of one grand body politic they will naturally conclude that the good of the whole must result from a due connection and harmony of all the parts and from the mutual exchange and intercourse of friendly offices nevertheless as this point seems to have been controverted a few observations tending to evince that a perpetual union between great britain and her american colonies will be mutually and reciprocally advantageous may not be less agreeable than necessary in the present dissertation  this is a subject the most truly important and interesting which can claim a britons notice and does honor to that worthy gentleman who proposed its discussion by the sons of this seminary struck with its vast delicacy and importance and conscious of inability to treat it in a manner suited to its dignity i had almost declined the arduous task but it is a glory even to fail in great attempts and if i should afford a hint to some abler pen or contribute to remove the smallest prejudice i shall think myself extremely happy in being so far beneficial to the public  we have already observed that the defense the strength and glory of britain principally depend on her navy and that her navy can only be maintained by trade and commerce these are points too plain to be denied or disputed by the most obstinate and perverse skeptic and it is a very natural inference from these premises that whatever contributes to enlarge and extend her commerce is highly advantageous to great britain  it must likewise be acknowledged that new settlements and young countries stand in need of the assistance and protection of some powerful commercial state destitute of these they would be exposed to the attacks of lawless invaders for want of strength to defend themselves and to the inclemency of weather for want of proper clothing for manufactures cannot be brought to any degree of perfection or extended to advantage except in wellsettled countries although agriculture where the land is tolerably fertile and the settlement secure may enable the inhabitants to procure the necessary manufactures in return for its productions  i hope therefore to make it appear that a reciprocal emolument will arise from a perpetual union between britain and her american colonies as she may by their means greatly enlarge her trade and commerce and become still more rich and powerful and as they will reap the advantage of her riches and power by being protected from their enemies and supplied with the conveniences of life at a cheaper rate and of a better quality than if manufactured by themselves  if we take a survey of the commerce of britain we shall find it extended to almost every part of the known world there is scarcely any place considerable for trade that is not visited by her adventurous merchants the means which have enabled her to acquire and support with dignity and advantage such large mercantile connections are to be sought for in her various manufactories amongst which the woollen is universally allowed the preference commercial writers have taken much pains to enumerate the particular kinds of british manufactures to show their mutual dependence and wherein the peculiar advantage of each consists as their works are in every ones hands it is the less necessary for me to repeat their substance and to particularize the articles which contribute to support the trade of britain  but there are two branches of commerce whcih though not so generally attended to are nevertheless most highly beneficial the fisheries of newfoundland capebreton and st johns and thereexportation of foreign goods have greatly increased the british navigation riches and power it is supposed that  000 sail of vessels are employed in those fisheries the number of hands necessary to navigate them to cure and dry the fish must be very large and great the consumption of provisions nets and other utensils brought almost entirely from england  goods for reexportation are received from different quarters some from germany flanders etc but in the greatest quantities from the east indies and america the bullion sent to the former is made an objection to that trade the force of which it is not my province to determine nothing of this sort can however be objected to the trade to the american plantations which is of all most advantageous to the nation there is scarcely any one species of english manufactures that is not vended in america those of india likewise come here to a ready market in short it is from great britain that the colonies import almost every thing requisite for clothing agriculture and other uses in return for these they send her sugar tobacco rice furs potash naval stores gold and silver and the balance of a considerable trade with portugal spain and other countries bordering on the mediterranean in bills of exchange  here is an occasion to expatiate on the benefits derived to britain from each of these particulars to observe the prodigious prices she paid for them to foreigners before their production in british america and the comcomparatively small prices for which they are procured at present the large quantities reexported to foreign markets and producing a demand upon them for very great sums annually might also be mentioned with much propriety nor would it be amiss to show the immense addition these articles bring to the revenue but all these topics have been so largely insisted on in late pamphlets and detached pieces and must be so well known to every one that further mention of them is unnecessary only i would beg leave to observe a particular still unnoticed in the year   0  the government of sweden refused a supply of pitch and tar unless for ready money at their own price and in swedish bottoms such a gross imposition awakened the indignation and resentment of britain and taught the true policy of deriving them from the colonies encouragement was thereupon given and soon produced a sufficient quantity to answer all her demands but the spirit of the nation was again lulled the sweeds resumed their trade and that of america was very much neglected  some perhaps will readily grant that the exportation of these articles from america is beneficial to her and serves to enrich her inhabitants but in what respect can it be esteemed advantageous to britain  this question admits a very obvious solution it is advantageous to britain in various respects it affords freight for many thousand ton of her shipping and a nursery of seamen for the royal navy the commissions enrich her merchants and the reexportation brings abundance of wealth into the kingdom the duties they pay are an immense increase of the revenue and they are received from the plantations in return for british productions and manufactures of which the colonies take off more than any foreign market whatever the importation of british goods and those received by the way of britain has on a medium for several years past amounted to upwards of two millions annually a sum so immense that although the colonies abound with valuable articles extremely well adapted to the british market and very beneficial to her trade and navigation and though they make large remittances by the way of spain portugal and italy in bills of exchange yet the produce of all these sources leaves a large balance in favor of britain which they pay her in gold and silver this in part furnishes bullion for the east india trade on account of which and the vast consumption of india goods the flourishing condition of that valuable branch of commerce may in no small degree very justly be attributed to the american colonies  thus we see that not only every species of the manufactures of britain but also her foreign trade and navigation are much indebted to america hence riches have flowed into her coffers and enabled her to support a fleet sufficient to maintain the empire of the ocean and whoever considers the state of the colonies must conclude that they have not been losers by their intercourse with their mother country consideration being had of the short time the american settlements have been made the inhabitants have increased in riches and number to admiration though far from enjoying that affluence of which some would represent them possessed the advantages of their trade have been mutual she by their means has continued to rise in wealth and power whilst they in the sunshine of her assistance and protection and the enjoyment of a beneficial commerce have grown up and flourished and still continue to flourish the equal advantage ornament and glory of britain  but should we only take a retrospect should we confine ourselves barely to what is past much injustice would be done to this animating subject and we should lose a prospect which cannot but afford the highest pleasure to every briton let us therefore look forward to the mutual benefits which with proper attention may hereafter arise  in order to this it will be necessary briefly to enumerate those articles of greatbritains foreign importations which have relation to the present subject they are raw thrown and wrought silk velvets linens timber boards potash and all kinds of naval stores several writers on trade have computed the balances paid by britain for those sorts of goods to france italy germany flanders norway denmark sweeden and russia and none i have met with make the amount less than two millions annually this she discharges in gold and silver perhaps matter of fact may be opposed to this estimate because there is not so great an exportation of bullion but the argument is not hereby invalidated if the balance on some other trade which would else be brought home and added to the national stock be diverted and sent to those places it is equally pernicious to the kingdom as if it was imported and then exported and this is certainly the case britain on her particular trade with holland for instance has a right to a very large balance in specie but the latter by keeping in her debt the nations abovementioned or several them who have demands on britain is enabled by their means to satisfy her british creditors and save her money and besides this bullion is sent to holland to answer bills of exchange drawn in favor of those nations  the consideration of this must deeply affect every one who has at heart the trade and prosperity of great britain and would preserve her independent of her european neighbors especially as the woollen manufactory is in its decline france not only supplies her own people with woollens but by the cheapness of her goods and the countenance of the court of spain has in a great measure supplanted england in the spanish markets the spaniards themselves sensible of their impolitic conduct seem determined to persist no longer in an error the result of illgrounded principles and mistaken notions of honor they have made several efforts to establish manufactories of their own wool which have by no means proved fruitless other nations of europe observing the success of france have copied her example by which england has lost much of her woollen trade particularly with portugal where the importation of this staple commodity seems to meet with many discouragements  from this reflection our attention is naturally turned to america which will be her surest and perhaps in time her only market as restored fabrication is likely to take place in every part of europe if under these circumstances such large sums are continually paid for foreign imports the balance of trade in favor of britain will be materially diminished the only remedy for this growing evil is to be found in america who can furnish a variety of the most useful raw materials on terms mutually beneficial  great quantities of furs and peltry have been and still are sent from the colonies to britain the acquisition of canada having thrown that whole trade into our hands but it is capable of greater improvement and may well supersede the fur trade to russia the northern indians with a little encouragement will bring their ermines and other fine furs from the  0th degree of latitude which is parallel with the european countries where the most valuable furs are procured the distance those people will travel to trade with our settlements is well known to all acquainted with their affairs this would likewise be a means of dispersing british manufactures amongst a multitude of indian tribes at present unknown to our traders  iron mines are so plenty in almost every province on the continent that it is thought with good reason they could supply all the markets in europe  as for timber boards pitch and tar they may likewise be procured here in great abundance british america extended along the coast more than  000 miles and reaching an unknown but prodigious way into the continent is almost one continued forest filled with every kind of useful timber notwithstanding the great devastions made within the two last centuries  here it may possibly be objected that the expensive freight of these bulky articles would render them unfit for the english markets the danes swedes and others employed at present in the lumber trade are no doubt by long experience become skillfull and can afford their goods at the cheapest rates but the colonies might be put upon a par with them by encouragement from the legislature greater difficulties in other instances have yielded to the efforts of british adventurers america may vie with any country whatever in plenty of materials and other conveniences and if large bulky ships were built of seven or eight hundred tons capable of being navigated by fewer hands in proportion to their burden than those in present use the expense of navigation would be much diminished the difference of distance between america and the gulphs of bothnia and finland from london is inconsiderable and america is nearest to lisbon cadiz and all the markets to the southward of cape finisterre and therefore might more conveniently supply those markets  the inconvenience and even absurdity of being supplied with naval stores by foreigners besides the disadvantage of consuming the national wealth is very evident every one knows that should a war be entered into with those nations or should they be confederated with the enemies of britain by cutting off the sinews of her strength they might reduce her to the utmost distresses both inconveniences would be remedied if naval stores were entirely procured from america who being connected with the mother country by every powerful tie would not fail to afford them in plenty on any emergency  hemp flax and silk manufactured and unmanufactured are articles for which britain pays large sums to foreigners as was observed before rough materials may be procured in the colonies which abound with low bottoms and deep rich soils requiring only cultivation to produce the most luxuriant crops of hemp and flax particularly in the southern colonies to confirm this i might mention the fertility of egypt which lies nearly under the same parallels of latitude with florida georgia carolina and virginia and is famous for the production of these commodities in the greatest perfection but experience is preferable to a thousand arguments  i mention silk because the abundance of mulberrytrees in the southern colonies seems naturally to point out the cultivation of that valuable article to this may be added that their soil climate and marme situation are pretty much the same with nankin and chekiang the most famous silk provinces in all china these circumstances afford good reason to believe the silkworm would thrive very well here and experience heightens the belief into certainty small trials have been made and some silk produced in carolina was esteemed by good judges equal to the finest of china or italy the hands employed in the cultivation of hemp and flax will have sufficient leisure to gather the leaves and feed the worms which will enable the planters to afford all these articles cheaper than may at first be imagined  from this it seems evident that materials for carrying on the silk and linen manufactories to the greatest extent may be procured from america and in great britain are prodigious numbers of poor who would cheerfully work to maintain themselves and families doomed to misery for want of employment to establish manufactories of those goods by public encouragement would therefore be an undertaking of the highest utility both to britain and the colonies fas est et ab host doceri it could be no disgrace to imitate in this respect the policy of france who knowing that trade is the only solid foundation of greatness is endeavoring to monopolize the three grand branches of manufactures  nor need the woollen manufacturer be afraid that his business would hereby receive the smallest prejudice there is a sufficient number of hands in the three kingdoms to carry on each of them to the greatest advantage many who at present cannot afford themselves the necessary covering would then be able to purchase more decent and comfortable clothing and the colonies having their sources of remittance enlarged would increase their already enormous demands for british manufactures  should this beneficial scheme be carried into execution more than two millions would be annually saved to the nation adequate employment provided for an incredible number of hands in britain and america and the trade navigation and riches of both would receive very large additions  it may possibly be thought from my appearing to confine fabrication to great britain that i am no friend to the colonies as there has of late been so many proposals for erecting manufactories in america i should esteem myself very unhappy in the displeasure of my countrymen none of the numerous sons of british america more ardently wishes her prosperity than myself or has a heart more devoted to her service conscious therefore of the rectitude of my intentions i will not doubt of being heard with candor though i venture to maintain that to divert their hands from their present lucrative employments and set them to work on manufactories would be incompatible with the true interest of the colonies  the number of their inhabitants though near three millions is small in proportion to the extent of continent they possess lands are consequently cheap and labor dear whatever therefore can be produced by means of the land with little labor must prove most advantageous hence arises the propriety of shipbuilding wherein the materials thus procurable are of primary consideration  for the same reason agriculture will bring more emolument to the colonies than could possibly arise from manufacturing goods whose chief value depends on the artificers labor nor will this circumstance render them at all more dependent abounding with the necessaries of life and materials for fabrication the produce of the willing earth they can at any time command a supply of the goods they want in greater plenty and of a better quality than would have been the result of their labor employed in manufactures i would not be understood by this reasoning to exclude the industrious farmer from working up his wool and other coarse articles unfit for exportation this will be doubly advantageous it will be a saving to himself and enable him to pay for the finer goods he may purchase with greater ease and punctuality  now upon a review of the whole we find that the trade of great britain to some places is vastly advantageous bringing large sums of money into the kingdom to others although no returns are made in specie but as much of their produce and manufactures received as is sent them of british it is nevertheless profitable affording employment for her people to a third sort though perhaps lucrative to some private merchants it is very pernicious and unprofitable to the nation in general as it drains the kingdom of great quantities of gold and silver we may also observe that the necessity of continuing the latter is removed by the colonies which are capable of furnishing at least materials for manufacturing all the particulars procured thereby with mutual benefit it likewise appears that a great part of her most advantageous trade depends on the colonies and that it may be still farther improved by america that whilst the colonies have contributed so much to enrich and aggrandize their mother country they have themselves been enriched and protected and that the scheme for rendering them still more advantageous to britain promises them an equal share of profit  whoever considers these circumstances will i am persuaded anticipate my conclusion but i cannot dismiss the subject without suggesting another argument which will not be esteemed a trifling one by men of seriousness and reflection the benefits arising from the protestant religion to those states which have embraced it and indeed to the world in general are very obvious every one acquainted with the affairs of europe must acknowledge their situation is far better than it was four or five centuries ago the religious and civil liberties of mankind are understood with more clearness and precision the human mind which before was crampt and confined in its researches has become more expanded and acquired much clearer knowledge in the arts in philosophy and divinity it is now very well known that philosophy does not consist in monkish jargon and that without virtue there can be no religion even those countries that are enemies to protestantism have been sharers in its happy essects the rays of knowledge have in some measure illuminated their clouded understandings but like those of the sun within the polar climates they are weak and languid  great britain has been the bulwark of the protestant interest ever since its existence and by her the attacks of its enemies have been repelled the british colonies established on principles of civil and religious liberty have hitherto been protected therein by their own noble efforts and her kind assistance and while they remain united the enjoyment of their liberties of both kinds will no doubt be continued in its full extent what would be the consequence of a disunion none can tell but there is more than a probability that these particulars would be deeply affected france our everwatchful enemy will be ready to seize any advantage that may offer she would have her armaments prepared to enter by st lawrence and the missisippi and might possibly overrun all the colonies should this be the case the candle of science would be soon extinguished and ignorance introduced in order to keep up a blind devotion and implicit obedience the genius of liberty would be driven from british america where she has hitherto delighted to reside and whether the mother country would be more fortunate i leave to the consideration of her patriot sons all  since then so many reciprocal advantages are the result of union between britain and america to render that union perpetual will be the only means of securing and transmiting them to posterity together with those immense benefits which are yet in prospect interest and affection  all the tender and endearing ties which connect mankind  backed by the venerable authority of religion plead for it with irresistible eloquence  whether the union ought to remain on its present establishment or whether it should receive a new form and impression are matters foreign to my purpose only permit me to suggest that in the important determination no partial views should be pursued but the interest of each and its relation to the whole should have a proper consideration  he must be either a madman or a novice in politics who would set the interest of one in competition with that of the other  they are inseperably connected and must stand or fall together  that maxim of mr pope may be here applied with much truth and propriety  self love and social are the same each will find their accounts in promoting the others happiness and prosperity in the discussion the trade of the colonies merits a peculiar attention should those methods i have taken the liberty to mention be fallen upon to enlarge it and free ports established in some parts of british america the national riches would be greatly increased the inhabitants of the spanish portuguese and other american settlements would resort thither for supplies of british manufactures and the produce of the colonies leaving in exchange for them large quantities of gold and silver a very considerable part of which would ultimately center in great britain  warmed and animated with a sincere love for my country i cannot but indulge a pleasing hope that britain and her colonies sensible of their true interest will steadily and with unremitting zeal pursue measures calculated to cement this union  the repeal of a late the american stamp act act of the british parliament and the present favorable disposition of that most respectable body fill us with the highest joy and promise redress of all our grievances and i am well persuaded my fellow subjects of america will not be wanting in any proper expressions of deference and subordination to the head of the british empire the wound which seemed to be attended with symptoms fatal to the mutual confidence subsisting between them will now be healed and i flatter myself without a scar by way of remembrance jealousies will subside animosities be forgotten harmony will be preserved in every part of the body politic and innumerable blessings entailed on posterity  end of second dissertation dissertation iii divide et impera however mankind as individuals may be swayed by the different motives of passion prejudice and honor yet when formed into states and communities these all subside and interest becomes the grand prevailing principle that actuates all their motions it is the pole star by which the political pilot must ever guide the helm of government where too keen a pursuit of it does not interfere with the faith of treaties or the natural rights of mankind an accurate discernment therefore of the true interest of a nation and a steady active prudence in the pursuit of it constitute the true political wisdom that ought to distinguish every statesman and so sensible are ministers of every complexion of the truth of this doctrine that however selfish and pernicious their views they seldom fail to cover them over with the plausible and specious coloring of national advantage  the establishing a grand commercial interest seems now to be the great object of the regard and attention of the different states of europe to this they are every day sacrificing the less important considerations of national pride and prejudice whatever therefore tends to promote or obstruct this great principle of government is now become a matter of serious consequence which deserves the closest attention and the tenderest care and amidst the rivalship and contention of the several european powers in attaining this capital point happy will that nation be whose administration shall lead to such measures as are most conducive to this end as a superiority may now be gained that may blast the hopes and at once dash the expectations of its aspiring competitors  if there is any one who at present bids fairest for this preeminence it is great britain whose free and happy constitution most admirably protects and cherishes an enterprizing commercial spirit a security of person and property is essentially necessary to the very being of a commercial nation and in this respect none of its rivals can claim superiority to the happy subjects of britain whose wise and valiant ancestors have handed down to them this glorious security sealed with their blood but not even this nor her natural situation so well adapted for safety from her enemies and the advancement of her trade nor yet the active genius and temper of her children may be sufficient to ensure her success if her colonies are neglected or oppressed if properly attended to they will prove the true sources of her wealth and power and enable her to soar above her emulating neighbors who will view her rapid progress with envy and admiration to enumerate the many mutual advantages they have already received from their close and intimate connection would be no easy task  but it would require little less than inspiration to forsee all the reciprocal advantages that will attend a future union between them formed upon proper upon generous principles  to point out those that are most obvious and which must necessarily follow is the design of this essay which pretends to no more than sketching out the imperfect outlines of a picture whose beauty has indeed been shaded but we trust and believe that time and experience will point out those blemishes and soon restore it to its former purity and luster to facilitate this has been the design of the generous friend to this institution who proposed the discussion of the present subject and it is a design worthy the benevolent patriotic spirit of an english senator  rome the mistress of the world and arbiter of nations by her wise policy and prudent conduct to her allies and colonists raised herself to an astonishing pitch of grandeur and power she encouraged she incorporated and never deprived them of any essential privileges by these rules she gained their affections and of factious turbulent citizens and often of invererate enemies she made faithful zealous and useful subjects great britain has at much expense of blood and treasure secured and protected her american colonies from the designs of france who viewed their rising power and growing importance with a jealous eye and therefore determined to nip them in the bud before they could ripen to any degree of formidable perfection happily for us these ambitious and fatal projects were crushed by the united valor and skill of great britain and her provinces to a happy and successful union in war let us then add the happy and harmonious union of peace nor lose its blessings by inattention to or disregard of the inestimable advantages that may nay that must attend it  colonies are emigrations from the mother country either occasioned by a quick population so as to render it too small for the support of its growing inhabitants or by oppression tyranny and undue exercise of power or sometimes by the distresses and desolation of war  in the first case they are always formed not only with the countenance but with the express encouragement and direction of the mother country  in the second instance unless prohibited by legal authority they generally go with its employed consent in the last which was the case of the trojans after the destruction of troy they go under a necessity which is superior to all law in either of these cases then but especially the two first they cannot be supposed to relinquish their claim to any of the rights and privileges of the country from which they go nor yet to have forfeited it no however remote they still continue subjects of the same kingdom and unless specially relinquished entitled to all the liberties privileges and immunities of that country of which they form one or more of the constituent parts if this be as true in fact as it is grateful in supposition the analogy made by an eminent writer dr strahans preface to domats civil law between the american colonies and those of spain which he supposes to be settled upon the same principles and therefore to be governed by the same policy must appear very strange but the principle upon which it is founded is as erroneous as the consequence deduced from it is derogatory to english liberty  the american colonies have been entiresettled by those who came under the immediate protection and countenance of the government or fled to it as an asylum from arbitrary and oppressive power a due consideration of the rights they claim and the duties they owe to the mother country may be necessary in some degree to ascertain with precision the advantages that will accrue from a complete and perfect union these rights and duties are reciprocal as well as the interest which arises from them  the rights we claim are the full and free enjoyment of constitutional liberty protection from foreign invasions and encouragement in every commercial interest which does not directly interfere with that of the mother country  the duties we owe are obedience under constitutional and legal restrictions and an exclusive preference to the mother country in every article of commerce and trade under one or other of these heads however widely diffused may be comprised every duty either owing to or from the mother country and and it is by a due and mutual observance of these only that their respective and reciprocal interests can be promoted from this just and wise policy will flow all those advantages which render a close and perfect union so desirable an object  and these may be considered either as they tend to increase the power and glory of great britain or as they advance its grand commercial interest and become the channels of its wealth or with regard to the colonies as they conduce to their safety nourishment and protection for though the true riches of a nation are said to consist in the number of its inhabitants and treasures are called the sinews of war it is very certain a nation may be very poor and very powerful at the same time or abound with wealth and yet be weak and impotent rome in its early ages was poor in every thing but the public spirit and bravery of her people while she was the dread and terror of the nations round her and spain is at present a lively instance that wealth and power are not inseparable who as the treasures of the indies have flowed in upon her has lost the martial animated spirit of her ancestors  as subjects of the same kingdom bearing allegiance to the same prince and controuled by the same executive power the americans are bound to contribute in proportion to their numbers and abilities to the defense and safety of the common cause what an accession of power to the british empire then is three millions of subjects dutiful loyal and brave who have on many occasions distinguished themselves and shown they were not unworthy the glorious stock from which they sprung who interest themselves in the honor and glory of the nation and partake of the veneration and respect due to it  here is a fund of hardy brave soldiers inured to fatigue and frugality ready to engage in the service of great britain whenever she thinks proper to require them from this fruitful this increasing source her armies and navies may receive constant supplies not of mercenary hierlings ready to engage in the service of the highest bidder but faithful dutiful children animated with becoming fortitude freedom and loyalty these if encouraged cherished and protected will indeed prove  of britains empire the support and strength thompson in order to make a colony of the most use and benefit to the mother country it is necessary that its climate its soil and natural produce should be essentially different from hers this will create a necessary connection and dependence between them the interchanging the commodities and produce of the one for those of the other will not only destroy the heartburnings and jealousy of a competition but produce an intercourse equally beneficial and durable to both it is happy therefore when the subjects of commerce cannot be the same as they thereby reap an advantage from which other nations are excluded who might either by withholding distress them or raise the balance against them when their necessities were not mutual and equal in this respect great britain is peculiarly happy in her colonies whose wide extent and different situations include a variety of climates soils and produce and thus form a proper basis for the commercial interest to which every other consideration should submit the islands produce commodities which the mother country must use and yet cannot raise these therefore she must procure by an intercourse with her colonies or lie at the mercy of those powers whose interest it might occasionally be to distress her but what adds to the advantage is that the subjects of commerce are not only easily procured but procured by a mutual exchange equally convenient and satisfactory to both and at the same time a large revenue secured not only upon the home consumption but on the surplus beyond their respective wants and necessities thus also as to the continent great britain both as a naval and commercial nation would be in a critical dangerous situation if she did not hold within her own reach all the materials necessary for the support of both an entire dependence upon any of her neighbors for one necessary article would in some degree make her subject to that neighbor but her colonies set her above every apprehension of this kind her northern provinces abound with timber of every kind necessary for building and equipping her navies immense bodies of ore both iron and copper are already discovered and usefully employed and doubtless much more lies still concealed in the bowels of the earth whose soil it properly cultivated and encouraged is richly productive of hemp and flax for the former of which great britain pays communibus annis l  00000 sterling her more southern colonies furnish her with the few remaining marine articles of pitch tar and turpentine  here then are found all the materials of timber iron cordage and every other species of naval stores necessary for the support nay the existence of great britain as a maritime power should i here mention bodies of saltpetre the spontaneous produce of the earth i may perhaps be thought too premature but if the promising appearances of that useful and expensive but neccssary commodity be happily confirmed here is a new source of national wealth and independance a large and constant balance which great britain pays to the indies in specie will be instantly saved and a surer quicker and cheaper supply at once secured next to the subjects of commerce which are necessary to enable the mother country to maintain her independance and rank among the other powers or europe we may place all these which are articles of convenience luxury and the surplus of those commodities which are not applied to naval purposes the real and absolute necessaries of life are but few the subjects of commerce are many and various as they contribute not only to the real but the imaginary capricious wants of mankind to provide therefore against these wants upon advantageous terms is a just and necessary policy and there are few very few of these articles which the colonists cannot furnish under proper encouragements the islands tender the various produce of their climate equal in quantity and quality with those of their neighbors the southern colonies of north america have as far as the infancy of the country will permit produced the different articles of silk rice indigo tobacco and even the tea plant has not been altogether uncultivated some of these have been carried to a much greater degree of cultivation than others but where it has great britain has received a proportionate benefit in the instance of tobacco only she has become not only the sole vender but almost the sole manufacturer for europe besides the immense revenue flowing immediately into her exchequer  wines are an article of luxury and it is perhaps upon that account they have not been so much attended to by the frugal temperate american but it is certain not only from theory but experience that the situation and soil of many parts of this extended continent are well adapted for producing them to what degree of perfection not only the cultivation of these but the other articles of convenience and luxury may arrive is difficult to determine but it is easy to see that the great the eventual profit will terminate in great britain i mentioned before the produce of the colonies as naval stores but considered as the raw materials of great and extensive manufactories which give bread to thousands and of idle clamorous starving subjects make useful and industrious citizens i cannot err when i say they are immensely useful to their mother country upon a view of the foreign trade of great britain we shall find that except that to portugal the balance is against her in every one to russia to sweden to denmark to germany she pays annually large sums in specie for those very commodities which her american colonies can and do produce and a great writer has observed that a country which constantly exports fewer manufactures or commodities than it receives will soon find the balance sinking will receive less and less till falling into extreme poverty it will receive nothing at all  here then we may trace the great utility of the colonies not only that they afford a constant and sure supply of the subjects of commerce necessary for the support of the power and manufactures of the mother country but in that she has an indisputable exclusive preference in the sale of them and the colonies in return are the fixed and constant customers for all her manufactures and commodities to which they are indispensably obliged to give the preference over those of other countries for as the design of colonizing was not to found a new empire but to extend the old there is no impropriety in appropriating the trade of the colonies to the mother country only if the balance was therefore in favor of colonies as is the case between great britain and the east indies it would be more eligible it should fall into the hands of its own subjects however remote than into those of a foreign power but where that balance is actually and greatly in favor of the mother country it becomes an interest that ought to be very dear to the cultivating of which the greatest care and attention of government should be applied that this is the case of great britain and her continential colonies the vast exportation of bullion and the still remaining debt of five millions most evidently evince with what a rapid astonishing progress this beneficial this lucrative trade has advanced the growing increase of the exports declare which arose from the year      from l         to the amazing amount of l    0  0 to this the mother country in a great measure owes her continuance as a trading nation when deprived of her valuable levant trade and her intercourse even with portugal greatly diminished and lessened by her active industrious rivals the french and dutch it is from this fountain those treasures flow which enable her to pay the respective balances to those countries with whom she trades on a disadvantageous footing america it is true does not extract them immediately from her own bowels she has a more valuable and durable resource in in the labor and industry of her inhabitants who exchange the surplus of their commodities beyond their own consumption and which might in some respects interfere with the staples of the mother country or at least be useless to her for those treasures which are only valuable to the colonists as they enable them to discharge past and contract future engagements for the manufactures of great britain  while therefore she possesses a market which she can call exclusively her own subject to her own regulations and the balance always in her favor whatever the colonies may acquire from any collateral branches of trade will quickly flow to the mother country as the great center of all their external prosits to restrain therefore or rather stop up those channels of remittance is in effect to prohibit the consumption of the manufactures of great britain as our desires to procure them have at all times been equal to and sometimes exceed our ability to pay for them whence it follows that a policy which ensures a small immediate revenue at the expense of a great though indirect national gain is mean and sordid unworthy the noble enterprizing spirit of a commercial nation  but i should leave this subject very imperfect indeed if i should omit two great funds of national wealth and power the fisheries and the furtrade the first of these is a mine richer than that of potosi and more inexhaustible for while our fisheries serve as a great subject of commerce they are also a fruitful nursery of brave hardy seamen trained up to fatigue to difficulty and danger  the furtrade which is now secured almost beyond the reach of accident is doubly valuable as it is enjoyed solely and exclusively  an advantage which is not confined to a monopoly of the raw materials and enhances their price only but enables great britain to be both the merchant and the manufacturer also and that upon her own terms while other nations must depend upon a precarious uncertain supply which which may either be raised in its price or totally withheld as the fluctuating policy of interest or friendship shall require this acquisition is not only valuable as it will probably revive a languishing dying manufactory but as it is a present an actual and considerable source of revenue both on the home consumption and also on that of foreigners  these are a few of the principal advantages with which a proper cultivation establishment and tender regard of the colonies may be attended to the mother country she has likewise many inferior ones the residence of those of affluent fortunes who may be led thither by veiws of education or mere curiosity is not altogether unworthy regard these all depend on and can only flow from a perfect complete union  by supporting that relationship between the mother country and her colonies which has planted in their bosoms so strong and lively an affection as to distinguish great britain by the tender endearing appellation of home  but it is time now that we should turn to the colonies and see what advantages they may propose to themselves from a dutiful and affectionate union with the mother country and from our past feelings we shall readily acknowledge we stand in need of her protection nurture and care exposed by our situation by a rivalship and competition of interests and yet in a state of infancy it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to form any union among ourselves that would be sufficient to repel the attacks of a formidable invader in this weak this defenseless state therefore we must look up to our indulgent parent whose vigorous salutary aid we have so often already experienced upon her we must rely for support and under her wing shelter ourselves against any attempts of those whose principles and government are incompatible with our religion and liberty a separation would be attended with certain ruin to the colonies in their present situation as they must necessarily fall a prey to one or other of those powers who would snatch with eagerness so tempting a prize  the first principle of nature selfpreservation therefore dictates to the colonies a steady a strict adherence to the mother country as upon that depends the enjoyment of every invaluable privilege of a civil or religious nature but we may not only consider her as the protector but as the nursing mother of her colonies arts sciences agriculture and commerce rise by slow degrees and are long before they arrive to any degree of perfection they are not of quick or spontaneous growth they must be planted cherished and encouraged and have we not experienced the tenderness of our mother country in this respect by her bounties dispersed not only in public channels but by private societies and patriotic individuals have we not reason to expect a continuance and perhaps an increase of her benevolent efforts in our behalf thus taking our enterprizing genius by the hand and leading it on in the paths of industry and useful improvements  to turn the attention of the colonies to the cultivation of those subjects of commerce which the mother country does not or cannot produce though to her it may be eventually profitable is to the colonies immediately and directly so and when it is done by mild by bountiful measures deserves our gratitude and thankful returns a fixed and permanent union between great britain and her colonies is absolutely necessary for the preservation of the peace and harmony of their internal administration for to form the constitution and plan of a new government or even to new model and revise the old is no easy or inconsiderable task that of the mother country has been the work of ages and to use the words of an eminent writer seems dictated by wisdom itself while therefore the colonists can enjoy all the blessings of an english constitution undiminished and uninterrupted it would be superlative madness and folly to run the risk of a change which could not possibly be for the better and might be infinitely worse unconnected and divided as they are at present both in situation and interest owing to the difference of settlement of charters of religion and commerce which are often clashing how difficult and next to impossible would it be to rescue them from a state of anarchy and form a constitution for which i will venture to say from the extent of america there can no precedent be found a constitution which at the same time that it reconciles these jarring interests must preserve every religious and civil liberty entire  the difficulties of an union for the purposes of empire are almost insuperable to canton out the provinces into petty independent kingdoms besides the arduous task of settling the internal police would subject them not only to perpetual quarrels with each other but render them an easy prey to some foreign power as they would singly be weak though united under one head truly formidable the only remaining resource of desperate distress must be to form the provinces into districts having full power of legislation within themselves  but subject to the control of some supreme superintendant authority raised out of the collective body as in some instances in germany or with more probability like holland or switzerland but this the vast extent of the colonies will render almost impossible as it would give being to an aristocracy  a kind of government as repugnant to the genius and temper of america as despotic monarchy  i therefore repeat it that the preservation of our laws commerce and every other blessing of domestic peace by the wise policy of the mother country can only be made the basis of a close and firm connection between her and them  next to the security of a state its wealth and convenience are to be regarded and to judge how beneficial great britain is to the colonies in this respect it may be proper to remark that as other countries produce the same commodities and have hitherto been able to undersell the americans in a variety of articles wherever an exclusive or even a preferable market has been given to the latter the advantage must be obvious this has been done in many instances by prohibitions or by duties charged on such commodities as interfered with those from the colonies which in some cases amount to a prohibition the british whale fishery has been almost wholly given up in favor of the american fisheries sugars hemp indigo and tobacco besides a variety of other articles from the colonies have met with every mark of encouragement while the same commodities from other countries have been discountenanced or wholly prohibited this is wise and just policy in the mother country at the same time that it discovers a tender regard to her children and makes it their interest to unite more closely in short they have every thing that can make a nation great happy and powerful to hope from a union every thing that is dangerous to fear from a division  divide et impera was the roman motto may it not be applicable to great britain and her american colonies who if united have proved themselves equal nay superior to two of the principal powers of europe but if divided if struggling with intestine commotions and civil discord i fear will prove unable to contend with either this to use the expression of a great and eminent friend of the colonies is the grand family compact which must be cemented by every tie of duty loyalty and affection from the provinces and every mark of kind protecting tenderness from the mother country a fatal underscerning policy had almost snapt these interesting cords asunder never perhaps to have been closed again but the guardian genius of britain and of america stepped between them and ruin and with outstretched hand saved a sinking nation  the romans decreed a crown to him who saved the life of a citizen in battle but what crowns or statues can do sufficient honor to the man or men who save a country a kingdom in the hour of distress and rescue a falling state from the brink of ruin rome may justly boast her brutuss her curtiuss her catos and her tullys  they were the pitts the conways and the bars of that age alike warmed by the sacred fire of liberty alike crowned with immortality and handed down to posterity the wonder and delight of admiring nations these glorious architects nobly aided by many others whose names will be held in long veneration have propd the tottering fabric of the british empire and pointed out that noble generous policy which will make one great system of government whereof britain will be the common center of attraction  under such a policy we can with joy look forwards and behold peace liberty and commerce diffusing their kindly influence over all the parts of greatbritains empire whose true happiness and permanent security can be no way effectually established but by a perpetual union between her and her american colonies  end of dissertation iii dissertation iv by francis hopkinson esquire at this important juncture when the eyes of all america are lifted to the mother country in anxious expectation when trembling fear or bold defiance enlivening hope or mysterious surmise distract every breast and sit in every brow what subject can be more interesting than the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual union between great britain and her colonies and yet there is no subject perhaps which the public is so little disposed to receive with candor and judge of with impartiality how then shall a native of america and an unexperienced writer especially in matters of such high importance presume to draw his pen but the worthy gentleman who has proposed this subject and backed his proposal with the reward of distinguished honor has raised in us who are candidates on this occasion that ambition which has in all ages prompted men to greater undertakings than cooler judgment would have suffered them to engage in  i do not mean in this little essay to calculate the advantages of trade between great britain and her colonies in order to show that they are reciprocal by the very nature of commerce they must be so there is no country in the world that exports staple commodities or manufactures but for an advantage to be gained or imports them but for the same reason  as the god of nature has adapted different countries to abound in different kinds of produce or excel in various useful arts it is evident that a commercial intercourse must redound to the benefit of the whole but how must this advantage be increased when we consider that great britain in her trade with her colonies does not support a foreign people whose religion politics and customs are different from her own but she supports and nourishes her own offspring at the same time that she enriches herself by the natural profits of an extensive trade and she strengthens herself by protecting and encouraging her own religion government and customs transplanted to america  commerce between great britain and her colonies is like the wholesome food which a man eats he cannot say his head his hands or his feet are more particularly benefited by it but the finer parts thereof circulate through the whole body and the whole body is nourished and supported  the three grand objects worthy the attention of a wise people are the state of their commerce liberty and religion if the commerce the liberty and religion both of great britain and her colonies can alone be supported and strengthened by a close and lasting union between them then the reciprocal advantages of such an union must be selfevident  i have slightly touched the first of these there have been so many accurate mercantile calculations made in almost every pamphlet that has been lately published on the subject that i take it for granted as a truth universally admitted that the advantages of trade between great britain and her colonies are reciprocal  with respect to political liberty should it not be the glory of england to transplant to water and carefully to nurse even in a distant land a system of government which is the admiration of the world and should not america adopt and cheerfully submit to such a government were it possible for great britain with an high and arbitrary hand to think of snatching from her colonies the essential privileges of englishmen and yet would have them submit as englishmen to her government and bear only the name and appearance of the freeborn sons of liberty it would be to dress her slaves in livery and deck america in robes of paper to make her the contempt and derision of every other nation on the other hand should the colonies with base ingratitude attempt to throw off all dependence on the mother country they would put themselves in the situation of a silly girl who leaves the guidance and protection of a wise and affectionate parent and wandering away exposes herself to ruin by the artful insinuations of every wicked and designing stranger but why should the mutual connection between the parentcountry and her colonies ever come into question are we not one nation and one people and do we not own obedience to one common king those who adopt the same religion the same plans of government and the same customs are undoubtedly of the same nation different climates and different soils mark out countries but not nations we of america are in all respects englishmen notwithstanding that the atlantic rolls her waves between us and the throne to which we all own allegiance nor can we though in ever so flourishing a state throw off our dependence or dissolve this union without breaking the very bonds of nature as well might the branch say unto the trunk see how i glow with blossoms and wave with foliage i have no further need of thy sap keep it for thy own nourishment  on the other hand does not great britain by transplanting her constitution into america as a scion from the stock propagate her own likeness nay does she not make unto herself another crown and another scepter  in all attacks that shall be made upon great britain by the numerous rivals of her power and enemies to her prosperity her colonies like a number of dutiful and promising children growing up round her will more and more add to her strength and contribute to her importance and should it ever happen amid the revolution of things human that those enemies should prevail against her what could her sons lose but the beautiful island they have so long possessed even in that case which we trust and believe will never happen they might find in the colonies a sure asylum thither they might remove with all the noble privileges of their constitution as to a people and country they can call their own and the british throne might yet shine with undiminished glory even in the present wilds of america  lastly with respect to the religious liberties of the people of england how precious they are let the price which has been paid for them declare  and these will be as much strengthened by a perpetual union with the colonies as their civil liberties  but exclusive of this consideration it certainly must be the glory of great britain to propagate protect and encourage in her colonies that sacred system of religious truth which she holds so dear indeed that she herself judges in this manner is evident from her many charitable donations for promoting the interest of learning and virtue in america  in short the protestant religion and particularly that excellent branch of it the national church of england is the pure and healthful air in which the political constitution of great britain moves and breathes with health and vigor religious liberty being hereby fixed on as firm and broad a basis as civil liberty both of which are so essentially interwoven with the nature of her government that it cannot be administered without them nor can her empire be more effectually strengthened than by extending with it whatever she finds valuable in her own possession this is her interest and it must be her honor as it is likewise the interest and honor of the colonies to receive nourish and join with her in the support of every thing of this kind which can only be done by a perpetual union between them  how detestable then must the politician be who shall ever attempt to kindle the destructive flames of jealousy between two friends whom nature seems to have united in the closest bonds and whose hearts and interests are and ever ought to be one should any one ever succeed in this which god forbid i doubt not but that after much cruel contention and unnatural bloodshed each would rush into the others arms and emphatically cry out we are both in the wrong  this subject might be expanded into volumes and no doubt will be but i leave the full discussion of it to more able hands and humbly hope this little essay will be accepted as the oblation of one who intimately feels the importance of this great truth that a perpetual union between great britain and her colonies will ever be reciprocally advantageous  finis
