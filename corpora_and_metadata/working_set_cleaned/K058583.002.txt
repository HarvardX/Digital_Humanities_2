almoran and hamet volume second  almoran and hamet an oriental tale  in two volumes  volume second  london printed for h pain and w cropley at drydens head in paternoster row  mdcclxi  almoran and hamet chap xi almoran had now reached the gallery and when the multitude saw him they shouted as in triumph and demanded that he should surrender hamet who also perceived him at a distance and was unwilling that any violence should be offered to his person pressed forward and when he was come near commanded silence at this moment almoran with a loud voice reproached them with impiety and folly and appealing to the power whom in his person they had offended the air suddenly grew dark a flood of lightning descended from the sky and a peal of thunder was articulated into these words divided sway the god who reigns alone abhors and gives to almoran the throne   the multitude stood aghast at the prodigy and hiding their faces with their hands every one departed in silence and confusion and hamet and omar were left alone omar was taken by some of the soldiers who had adhered to almoran but hamet made his escape  almoran whose wishes were thus far accomplished by the intervention of a power superior to his own exulted in the anticipation of that happiness which he now supposed to be secured and was fortified in his opinion that he had been wretched only because he had been weak and that to multiply and not to suppress his wishes was the way to acquire felicity  as he was returning from the gallery he was met by osmyn and caled who had heard the supernatural declaration in his behalf and learned its effects almoran in that hasty flow of unbounded but capricious favor which in contracted minds is the effect only of unexpected good fortune raised osmyn from his feet to his bosom as in the trial said he thou have been faithful i now invest thee with a superior trust the toils of state shall from this moment devolve upon thee and from this moment the delights of empire unallayed shall be mine i will recline at ease remote from every eye but those that reflect my own felicity the felicity that i shall taste in secret surrounded by the smiles of beauty and the gaities of youth like heaven i will reign unseen and like heaven though unseen i will be adored osmyn received this delegation of power with a tumultuous pleasure that was expressed only by silence and confusion almoran remarked it and exulting in the pride of power he suddenly changed his aspect and regarding osmyn who was yet blushing and whose eyes were swimming in tears of gratitude with a stern and ardent countenance let me however said he warn thee to be watchful in thy trust beware that no rude commotion violate my peace by thy fault lest my anger sweep thee in a moment to destruction he then directed his eye to caled and thou too said he have been faithful be thou next in honor and in power to osmyn guard both of you my paradise from dread and care fulfill the duty that i have assigned you and live  he was then informed by a messenger that hamet had escaped and that omar was taken as he now despised the power both of hamet and omar he expressed neither concern nor anger that hamet had fled but he ordered omar to be brought before him  when omar appeared bound and disarmed he regarded him with a smile of insult and derision and asked him what he had now to hope i have indeed said omar much less to hope than thou have to fear thy insolence said almoran is equal to thy folly what power on earth is there that i should fear thy own said omar i have not leisure now replied almoran to hear the paradoxes of thy philosophy explained but to show thee that i fear not thy power thou shall live i will leave thee to hopeless regret to wiles that have been scorned and defeated to the unheeded petulance of dotage to the fondness that is repayed with neglect to restless wishes to credulous hopes and to derided command to the slow and complicated torture of despised old age and that when thou shall long have abhorred thy being shall destroy it the misery said omar which thou have menaced it is not in thy power to inflict as thou have taken from me all that i possessed by the bounty of thy father it is true that i am poor it is true also that my knees are now feeble and bend with the weight of years that is upon me i am as thou art a man and therefore i have erred but i have still kept the narrow path in view with a faithful vigilance and to that i have soon returned the past therefore i do not regret and the future i have no cause to fear in him who is most merciful i have hope and in that hope even now i rejoice before thee my portion in the present hour is adversity but i receive it not only with humility but thankfulness for i know that whatever is ordained is best  almoran in whose heart there were no traces of omars virtue and therefore no foundation for his confidence sustained himself against their force by treating them as hypocrisy and affectation i know says he that thou have long learned to echo the specious and pompous sounds by which hypocrites conceal their wretchedness and excite the admiration of folly and the contempt of wisdom yet thy walk in this place shall be still unrestrained here the splendour of my felicity shall fill thy heart with envy and cover thy face with confusion and from thee shall the world be instructed that the enemies of almoran can move no passion in his breast but contempt and that most to punish them is to permit them to live  omar whose eye had till now been fixed upon the ground regarded almoran with a calm but steady countenance here then said he will i follow thee constant as thy shadow tho as thy shadow unnoticed or neglected here shall mine eye watch those evils that were appointed from everlasting to attend upon guilt and here shall my voice warn thee of their approach from thy breast may they be averted by righteousness for without this though all the worlds that roll above thee should to aid thee unite all their power that power can aid thee only to be wretched  almoran in all the pride of gratified ambition invested with dominion that had no limits and allied with powers that were more than mortal was overawed by this address and his countenance grew pale but the next moment disdaining to be thus controuled by the voice of a slave his cheeks were suffused with the blushes of indignation he turned from omar in scorn anger and confusion without reply and omar departed with the calm dignity of a benevolent and superior being to whom the smiles and frowns of terrestrial tyranny were alike indifferent and in whom abhorrence of the turpitude of vice was mingled with compassion for its folly  chap xii in the mean time almeida who had been conveyed to an apartment in almorans seraglio and delivered to the care of those who attended upon his women suffered all that grief and terror could inflict upon a generous a tender and a delicate mind yet in this complicated distress her attention was principally fixed upon hamet the disappointment of his hope and the violation of his right were the chief objects of her regret and her fears in all that had already happened and in all that was still to come every insult that might be offered to herself she considered as an injury to him yet the thoughts of all that he might suffer in her person gave way to her apprehensions of what might befall him in his own in his situation every calamity that her imagination could conceive was possible her thoughts were therefore bewildered amidst an endless variety of dreadful images which started up before them which way soever they were turned and it was impossible that she could gain any certain intelligence of his fate as the splendid prison in which she was now confined was surrounded by mutes and eunuchs of whom nothing could be learned or in whose report no confidence could be placed  while her mind was in this state of agitation and distress she perceived the door open and the next moment almoran entered the apartment when she saw him she turned from him with a look of unutterable anguish and hiding her face in her veil she burst into tears the tyrant was moved with her distress for unfeeling obduracy is the vice only of the old whose sensibility has been worn away by the habitual perpetration of reiterated wrongs  he approached her with looks of kindness and his voice was involuntarily modulated to pity she was however too much absorbed in her own sorrows to reply he gazed upon her with tenderness and admiration and taking her hand into his own he pressed it ardently to his bosom his compassion soon kindled into desire and from soothing her distress he began to solicit her love this instantly roused her attention and resentment now suspended her grief she turned from him with a firm and haughty step and instead of answering his professions reproached him with her wrongs almoran that he might at once address her virtue and her passions observed that though he had loved her from the first moment he had seen her yet he had concealed his passion even from her till it had received the sanction of an invisible and superior power that he came therefore the messenger of heaven and that he offered her unrivalled empire and everlasting love to this she answered only by an impatient and fond enquiry after hamet think not of hamet said almoran for why should he who is rejected of heaven be still the favorite of almeida if thy hand said almeida could quench in everlasting darkness that vital spark of intellectual fire which the word of the almighty has kindled in my breast to burn for ever then might almeida cease to think of hamet but while that shall live whatever form it shall inhabit or in whatever world it shall reside his image shall be for ever present and to him shall my love be for ever true this glowing declaration of her love for hamet was immediately succeeded by a tender anxiety for his safety and a sudden reflection upon the probability of his death and the danger of his situation if alive threw her again into tears  almoran whom the ardour and impetuosity of her passions kept sometimes silent and sometimes threw into confusion again attempted to sooth and comfort her she often urged him to tell her what was become of his brother and he as often evaded the question as she was about to renew her enquiry and reflected that it had already been often made and had not yet been answered she thought that almoran had already put him to death this threw her into a new agony of which he did not immediately discover the cause but as he soon learned it from her reproaches and exclamations he perceived that he could not hope to be heard while she was in doubt about the safety of hamet in order therefore to sooth her mind and prevent its being longer possessed with an image that excluded every other he assumed a look of concern and astonishment at the imputation of a crime which was at once so horrid and so unnecessary after a solemn deprecation of such enormous guilt he observed that as it was now impossible for hamet to succeed as his rival either in empire or in love without the breach of a command which he knew his virtue would implicitly obey he had no motive either to desire his death or to restrain his liberty his walk says he is still uncircumscribed in persia and except this chamber there is no part of the palace to which he is not admitted  to this declaration almeida listened as to the music of paradise and it suspended for awhile every passion but her love the sudden ease of her mind made her regardless of all about her and she had in this interval suffered almoran to remove her veil without reflecting upon what he was doing the moment she recollected herself she made a gentle effort to recover it with some confusion but without anger the pleasure that was expressed in her eyes the blush that glowed upon her cheek and the contest about the veil which to an amorous imagination had an air of dalliance concurred to heighten the passion of almoran almost to phrensy she perceived her danger in his looks and her spirits instantly took the alarm he seized her hand and gazing ardently upon her he conjured her with a tone and emphasis that strongly expressed the tumultuous vehemence of his wishes that she would renounce the rites which had been forbidden above and that she would receive him to whom by miracle she had been alloted  almeida whom the manner and voice of almoran had terrified into silence answered him at first only with a look that expressed aversion and disdain overawed by fear will thou not said almoran fulfill the decrees of heaven i conjure thee by heaven to answer from this solemn reference to heaven almeida derived new fortitude she instantly recollected that she stood in the presence of him by whose permission only every other power whether visible or invisible can dispense evil or good urge no more said she as the decree of heaven that which is inconsistent with divine perfection can he in whose hand my heart is command me to wed the man whom he has not enabled me to love can the pure the just the merciful have ordained that i should suffer embraces which i loath and violate vows which his laws permitted me to make can he have ordained a perfidious a loveless and a joyless prostitution what if a thousand prodigies should concur to enforce it a thousand times the deed itself would be a stronger proof that those prodigies were the works of darkness than those prodigies that the deed was commanded by the father of light  almoran whose hopes were now blasted to the root who perceived that the virtue of almeida could neither be deceived nor overborne that she at once contemned his power and abhorred his love gave way to all the furies of his mind which now slumbered no more his countenance expressed at once anger indignation and despair his gesture became furious and his voice was lost in menaces and execrations almeida beheld him with an earnest yet steady countenance till he vowed to revenge the indignity he had suffered upon hamet at the name of hamet her fortitude forsook her the pride of virtue gave way to the softness of love her cheeks became pale her lips trembled and taking hold of the robe of almoran she threw herself at his feet his fury was at first suspended by hope and expectation but when from her words which grief and terror had rendered scarce articulate he could learn only that she was pleading for hamet he burst from her in an ecstasy of rage and forcing his robe from her hand with a violence that dragged her after it he rushed out of the chamber and left her prostrate upon the ground  as he passed through the gallery with a hasty and disordered pace he was seen by omar who knowing that he was returned from an interview with almeida and conjecturing from his appearance what had happened judged that he ought not to neglect this opportunity to warn him once more of the delusive phantoms which under the appearance of pleasure were leading him to destruction he therefore followed him unperceived till he had reached the apartment in which he had been used to retire alone and heard again the loud and tumultuous exclamations which were wrung from his heart by the anguish of disappointment what have i gained said he by absolute dominion the slave who secluded from the gales of life and from the light of heaven toils without hope in the darkness of the mine riots in the delights of paradise compared with me by the caprice of one woman i am robbed not only of enjoyment but of peace and condemned for ever to the torment of unsatisfied desire  omar who was impatient to apprize him that he was not alone and to prevent his disclosing sentiments which he wished to conceal now threw himself upon the ground at his feet presumptuous slave said almoran from whence and wherefore art thou come i am come said omar to tell thee that not the caprice of a woman but the wishes of almoran have made almoran wretched the king stung with the reproach drew back and with a furious look laid his hand upon his poignard but was immediately restrained from drawing it by his pride i am come said omar to repeat that truth upon which great as thou art thy fate is suspended thy power extends not to the mind of another exert it therefore upon thy own suppress the wishes which thou can not fulfill and secure the happiness that is within thy reach  almoran who could bear no longer to hear the precepts which he disdained to practice sternly commanded omar to depart be gone said he lest i crush thee like a noisome reptile which men cannot but abhor though it is too contemptible to be feared i go said omar that my warning voice may yet again recall thee to the path of wisdom and of peace if yet again i shall behold thee while it is to be found  chap xiii almoran was now left alone and throwing himself upon a sofa he sat some time motionless and silent as if all his faculties had been suspended in the stupefaction of despair he revolved in his mind the wishes that had been gratified and the happiness of which he had been disappointed i desired said he the pomp and power of undivided dominion and hamet was driven from the throne which he shared with me by a voice from heaven i desired to break off his marriage with almeida and it was broken off by a prodigy when no human power could have accomplished my desire it was my wish also to have the person of almeida in my power and this wish also has been gratified yet i am still wretched but i am wretched only because the means have not been adequate to the end what i have hitherto obtained i have not desired for itself and of that for which i desired it i am not possessed i am therefore still wretched because i am weak with the soul of almoran i should have the form of hamet then my wishes would indeed be filled then would almeida bless me with consenting beauty and the splendour of my power should distinguish only the intervals of my love my enjoyments would then be certain and permanent neither blasted by disappointment nor withered by satiety when he had uttered these reflections with the utmost vehemence and agitation his face was again obscured by gloom and despair his posture was again fixed and he was falling back into his former state of silent abstraction when he was suddenly roused by the appearance of the genius the sincerity of whose friendship he began to distrust  almoran said the genius if thou art not yet happy know that my powers are not yet exhausted fear me not but let thine ear be attentive to my voice the genius then stretched out his hand toward him in which there was an emerald of great luster cut into a figure that had four and twenty sides on each of which was engraven a different letter thou see said he this talisman on each side of it is engraven one of those mysterious characters of which are formed all the words of all the languages that are spoken by angels genii and men this shall enable thee to change thy figure and what under the form of almoran thou can not accomplish thou shall still be able to effect if it can be effected by thee in the form of any other point only to the letters that compose the name of him whose appearance thou would assume and it is done remember only that upon him whose appearance thou shall assume thine shall be impressed till thou restorest his own hide the charm in thy bosom and avail thyself of its power almoran received the talisman in a transport of gratitude and joy and the genius immediately disappeared  the use of this talisman was so obvious that it was impossible to overlook it almoran instantly conceived the design with which it was given and determined instantly to put it in execution i will now said he assume the figure of hamet and my love in all its ardour shall be returned by almeida as his fancy kindled at the anticipation of his happiness he stood musing in a pleasing suspense and indulged himself in the contemplation of the several gradations by which he should ascend to the summit of his wishes  just at this moment osmyn whom he had commanded to attend him at this hour approached his apartment almoran was roused by the sound of his foot and supposed it to be omar who had again intruded upon his privacy he was enraged at the interruption which had broken a series of imaginations so flattering and luxurious he snatched out his poignard and lifting up his arm for the stroke hastily turned round to have stabbed him but seeing osmyn he discovered his mistake just in time to prevent the blow  osmyn who was not conscious of any crime nor indeed of any act that could have given occasion of offense started back terrified and amazed and stood trembling in suspense whether to remain or to withdraw almoran in the mean time sheathed the instrument of death and bid him fear nothing for he should not be hurt he then turned about and putting his hand to his forehead stood again silent in a musing posture he recollected that if he assumed the figure of hamet it was necessary he should give orders for hamet to be admitted to almeida as he would otherwise be excluded by the delegates of his own authority turning therefore to osmyn remember said he that whenever hamet shall return it is my command that he be admitted to almeida  osmyn who was pleased with an opportunity of recommending himself to almoran by praising an act of generous virtue which he supposed him now to exert in favor of his brother received the command with a look that expressed not only approbation but joy let the sword of destruction said he be the guard of the tyrant the strength of my lord shall be the bonds of love those who honor thee as almoran shall rejoice in thee as the friend of hamet to almoran who was conscious to no kindness for his brother the praise of osmyn was a reproach he was offended at the joy which he saw kindled in his countenance by a command to show favor to hamet and was fired with sudden rage at that condemnation of his real conduct which was implied by an encomium on the generosity of which he assumed the appearance for a malevolent and perfidious purpose his brow was contracted his lip quivered and the hilt of his dagger was again grasped in his hand osmyn was again overwhelmed with terror and confusion he had again offended but knew not his offense in the mean time almoran recollecting that to express displeasure against osmyn was to betray his own secret endeavored to suppress his anger but his anger was succeeded by remorse regret and disappointment the anguish of his mind broke out in imperfect murmurs what i am said he is to this wretch the object not only of hatred but of scorn and he commends only what i am not in what to him i would seem to be  these sounds which though not articulate were yet uttered with great emotion were still mistaken by osmyn for the overflowings of capricious and causeless anger my life says he to himself is even now suspended in a doubtful balance whenever i approach this tyrant i tread the borders of destruction like a hoodwinked wretch who is left to wander near the brink of a precipice i know my danger but which way soever i turn i know not whether i shall incur or avoid it  in these reflections did the sovereign and the slave pass those moments in which the sovereign intended to render the slave subservient to his pleasure or his security and the slave intended to express a zeal which he really felt and a homage which his heart had already paid osmyn was at length however dismissed with an assurance that all was well and almoran was again left to reflect with anguish upon the past to regret the present and to anticipate the future with solicitude anxiety and perturbation  he was however determined to assume the figure of his brother by the talisman which had been put into his power by the genius but just as he was about to form the spell he recollected that by the same act he would impress his own likeness upon hamet who would consequently be invested with his power and might use it to his destruction this held him some time in suspense but reflecting that hamet might not perhaps be apprized of his advantage till it was too late to improve it that he was now a fugitive and probably alone leaving persia behind him with all the speed he could make and that at the worst if he should be still near if he should know the transformation as soon as it should be made and should instantly take the most effectual measures to improve it yet as he could dissolve the charm in a moment whenever it should be necessary for his safety no formidable danger could be incurred by the experiment to which he therefore proceeded without delay  chap xiv in the mean time hamet to whom his own safety was of no importance but for the sake of almeida resolved if possible to conceal himself near the city having therefore reached the confines of the desert by which it was bounded on the east he quitted his horse and determined to remain there till the multitude was dispersed and the darkness of the evening might conceal his return when in less than an hour he could reach the palace  he sat down at the foot of the mountain kabessed without considering that in this place he was most likely to be found as those who travel the desert seldom fail to enter the cave that winds its way under the mountain to drink of the water that issues there from a clear and copious spring  he reviewed the scenes of the day that was now nearly passed with a mixture of astonishment and distress to which no description can be equal the sudden and amazing change that a few hours had made in his situation appeared like a wild and distressful dream from which he almost doubted whether he should not wake to the power and the felicity that he had lost he sat some time bewildered in the hurry and multiplicity of his thoughts and at length burst out into passionate exclamations what says he and where am i am i indeed hamet that son of solomon who divided the dominion of persia with his brother and who possessed the love of almeida alone dreadful vicissitude i am now an outcast friendless and forlorn without an associate and without a dwelling for me the cup of adversity overflows and the last dregs of sorrow have been wrung out for my portion the powers not only of the earth but of the air have combined against me and how can i stand alone before them but is there no power that will interpose in my behalf if he who is supreme is good i shall not perish but wherefore am i thus why should the desires of vice be accomplished by superior powers and why should superior powers be permitted to disappoint the expectations of virtue yet let me not rashly question the ways of him in whose balance the world is weighed by him every evil is rendered subservient to good and by his wisdom the happiness of the whole is secured yet i am but a part only and for a part only i can feel to me what is that goodness of which i do not partake in my cup the gall is unmixed and have i not therefore a right to complain but what have i said let not the gloom that surrounds me hide from me the prospect of immortality shall not eternity atone for time eternity to which the duration of ages is but as an atom to a world shall i not when this momentary separation is past again meet almeida to part no more and shall not a purer flame than burns upon the earth unite us even at this moment her mind which not the frauds of sorcery can taint or alienate is mine that pleasure which she reserved for me cannot be taken by force it is in the consent alone that it subsists and from the joy that she feels and from that only proceeds the joy she can bestow  with these reflections he soothed the anguish of his mind till the dreadful moment arrived in which the power of the talisman took place and the figure of almoran was changed into that of hamet and the figure of hamet into that of almoran  at the moment of transformation hamet was seized with a sudden languor and his faculties were suspended as by the stroke of death when he recovered his limbs still trembled and his lips were parched with thirst he rose therefore and entering the cavern at the mouth of which he had been sitting he stooped over the well to drink but glancing his eyes upon the water he saw with astonishment and horror that it reflected not his own countenance but that of his brother he started back from the prodigy and supporting himself against the side of the rock he stood some time like a statue without the power of recollection but at length the thought suddenly rushed into his mind that the same sorcery which had suspended his marriage and driven him from the throne was still practiced against him and that the change of his figure to that of almoran was the effect of almorans having assumed his likeness to obtain in this disguise whatever almeida could bestow this thought like a whirlwind of the desert totally subverted his mind his fortitude was borne down and his hopes were rooted up no principles remained to regulate his conduct but all was phrensy confusion and despair he rushed out of the cave with a furious and distracted look and went in haste toward the city without having formed any design or considered any consequence that might follow  the shadows of the mountains were now lengthened by the declining sun and the approach of evening had invited omar to meditate in a grove that was adjacent to the gardens of the palace from this place he was seen at some distance by hamet who came up to him with a hasty and disordered pace and omar drew back with a cold and distant reverence which the power and the character of almoran concurred to excite hamet not reflecting upon the cause of this behavior was offended and reproached him with the want of that friendship he had so often professed the vehemence of his expression and demeanor suited well with the appearance of almoran and omar as the best proof of that friendship which had been impeached took this opportunity to repeat his admonitions in the behalf of hamet what ever evil said he thou can bring upon hamet will be doubled to thyself to his virtues the power that fills infinitude is a friend and he can be afflicted only till they are perfect but thy sufferings will be the punishment of vice and as long as thou art vicious they must increase  hamet who instantly recollected for whom he was mistaken and the anguish of whose mind was for a moment suspended by this testimony of esteem and kindness which could not possibly be feigned and which was paid him at the risque of life when it could not be known that he received it ran forward to embrace the hoary sage who had been the guide of his youth and cried out in a voice that was broken by contending passions the face is the face of almoran but the heart is the heart of hamet   omar was struck dumb with astonishment and hamet who was impatient to be longer mistaken related all the circumstances of his transformation and reminded him of some particulars which could be known only to themselves can thou not yet believe said he that i am hamet when thou have this day seen me banished from my kingdom when thou have now met me a fugitive returning from the desert and when i learnt from thee since the sun was risen which is not yet set that more than mortal powers were combined against me i now believe said omar that thou indeed art hamet stay me not then said hamet but come with me to revenge beware said omar lest thou endanger the loss of more than empire and almeida if not to revenge said hamet i may at least be permitted to punish thy mind says omar is now in such a state that to punish the crimes by which thou have been wronged will dip thee in the guilt of blood why else are we forbidden to take vengeance for ourselves and why is it reserved as the prerogative of the most high in him and in him alone it is goodness guided by wisdom he approves the means only as necessary to the end he wounds only to heal and destroys only to save he has complacence not in the evil but in the good only which it is appointed to produce remember therefore that he to whom the punishment of another is sweet though his act may be just with respect to others with respect to himself it is a deed of darkness and abhorred by the almighty hamet who had stood abstracted in the contemplation of the new injury he had suffered while omar was persuading him not to revenge it started from his posture in all the wildness of distraction and bursting away from omar with an ardent and furious look hasted toward the palace and was soon out of sight  chap xv in the mean time almoran after having effected the transformation was met as he was going to the apartment of almeida by osmyn osmyn had already experienced the misery of dependent greatness that kept him continually under the eye of a capricious tyrant whose temper was various as the gales of summer and whose anger was sudden as the bolt of heaven whose purpose and passions were dark and impetuous as the midnight storm and at whose command death was inevitable as the approach of time when he saw almoran therefore in the likeness of hamet he felt a secret desire to apprize him of his situation and offer him his friendship  almoran who with the form assumed the manners of hamet addressed osmyn with a mild though mournful countenance at length said he the will of almoran alone is law does it permit me to hold a private rank in this place without molestation it permits said osmyn yet more he has commanded that you should have admittance to almeida almoran whose vanity betrayed him to flatter his own power in the person of hamet replied with a smile i know that almoran who presides like a god in silent and distant state reveals the secrets of his will to thee i know that thou art  i am said osmyn of all thou see most wretched at this declaration almoran turned short and fixed his eyes upon osmyn with a look of surprise and anger does not the favor of almoran said he whose smile is power and wealth and honor shine upon thee my lord said osmyn i know so well the severity of thy virtue that if i should even for thy sake become perfidious to thy brother  almoran who was unable to preserve the character of hamet with propriety interrupted him with a fierce and haughty tone how said he perfidious to my brother to almoran perfidious  osmyn who had now gone too far to recede and who still saw before him the figure of hamet proceeded in his purpose i knew said he that in thy judgment i should be condemned and yet the preservation of life is the strongest principle of nature and the love of virtue is her proudest boast explain thyself said almoran for i cannot comprehend thee i mean said osmyn that he whose life depends upon the caprice of a tyrant is like the wretch whose sentence is already pronounced and who if the wind does but rush by his dungeon imagines that it is the bowstring and the mute fear not said almoran who now affected to be again calm be still faithful and thou shall still be safe alas said osmyn there is no diligence no toil no faith that can secure the slave from the sudden phrensy of passion from the causeless rage either of drunkenness or lust i am that slave the slave of a tyrant whom i hate the confusion of almoran was now too great to be concealed and he stood silent with rage fear and indignation osmyn supposing that his wonder suspended his belief of what he had heard confirmed his declaration by an oath  whoever thou art to whose mind almoran the mighty and the proud is present before whom the lord of absolute dominion stands trembling and rebuked who see the possessor of power by which nature is controuled pale and silent with anguish and disappointment if in the fury of thy wrath thou have aggravated weakness into guilt if thou have chilled the glow of affection when it flushed the cheek in thy presence with the frown of displeasure or repressed the ardour of friendship with indifference or neglect now let thy heart smite thee for in thy folly thou have cast away that gem which is the light of life which power can never seize and which gold can never buy  the tyrant fell at once from his pride like a star from heaven and osmyn still addressing him as hamet at once increased his misery and his fears o said he that the throne of persia was thine then should innocence enjoy her birthright of peace and hope should bid honest industry look upward there is not one to whom almoran has delegated power nor one on whom his transient favor has bestowed any gift who does not already feel his heart throb with the pangs of boding terror nor is there one who if he did not fear the displeasure of the invisible power by whom the throne has been given to thy brother would not immediately revolt to thee  almoran who had hitherto remained silent now burst into a passionate exclamation of self pity what can i do said he and whither can i turn osmyn who mistook the cause of his distress and supposed that he deplored only his want of power to avail himself of the general disposition in his favor endeavored to fortify his mind against despair your state said he indeed is distressful but not hopeless the king who though addressed as hamet was still betrayed by his confusion to answer as almoran smote his breast and replied in an agony it is hopeless osmyn remarked his emotion and despair with a concern and astonishment that almoran observed and at once recollected his situation he endeavored to retract such expressions of trouble and despondency as did not suit the character he had assumed and telling osmyn that he thanked him for his friendship and would improve the advantages it offered him he directed him to acquaint the eunuchs that they were to admit him to almeida when he was left alone his doubts and perplexity held him long in suspense a thousand expedients occurred to his mind by turns and by turns were rejected  his first thought was to put osmyn to death but he considered that by this he would gain no advantage as he would be in equal danger from whoever should succeed him he considered also that against osmyn he was upon his guard and that he might at any time learn from him whatever design might be formed in favor of hamet by assuming hamets appearance that he would thus be the confident of every secret in which his own safety was concerned and might disconcert the best contrived project at the very moment of its execution when it would be too late for other measures to be taken he determined therefore to let osmyn live at least till it became more necessary to cut him off having in some degree soothed and fortified his mind by these reflections he entered the apartment of almeida  his hope was not founded upon a design to marry her under the appearance of hamet for that would be impossible as the ceremony must have been performed by the priests who supposed the marriage with hamet to have been forbidden by a divine command and who therefore would not have consented even supposing they would otherwise have ventured at the request of hamet to perform a ceremony which they knew would be displeasing to almoran but he hoped to take advantage of her tenderness for his brother and the particular circumstances of her situation which made the solemnities of marriage impossible to seduce her to gratify his desires without the sanction which alone rendered the gratification of them lawful if he succeeded in this design he had reason to expect either that his love would be extinguished by enjoyment or that if he should still desire to marry almeida he might by disclosing to her the artifice by which he had effected his purpose prevail upon her to consent as her connection with hamet the chief obstacle to her marriage with him would then be broken for ever and as she might perhaps wish to sanctify the pleasure which she might be not unwilling to repeat or at least to make that lawful which it would not be in her power to prevent  in this disposition and with this design he was admitted to almeida who without suspicion of her danger was exposed to the severest trial in which every passion concurred to oppose her virtue she was solicited by all the powers of subtilty and desire under the appearance of a lover whose tenderness and fidelity had been long tried and whose passion she returned with equal constancy and ardour and she was thus solicited when the rites which alone could consecrate their union were impossible and were rendered impossible by the guilty designs of a rival in whose power she was and from whom no other expedient offered her a deliverance thus deceived and betrayed she received him with an excess of tenderness and joy which flattered all his hopes and for a moment suspended his misery she enquired with a sond and gentle solicitude by what means he had gained admittance and how he had provided for his retreat he received and returned her caresses with a vehemence in which to less partial eyes desire would have been more apparent than love and in the tumult of his passion he almost neglected her enquiries finding however that she would be answered he told her that being by the permission of almoran admitted to every part of the palace except that of the women he had found means to bribe the eunuch who kept the door who was not in danger of detection because almoran wearied with the tumult and fatigue of the day had retired to sleep and given order to be called at a certain hour she then complained of the solicitations to which she was exposed expressed her dread of the consequences she had reason to expect from some sudden sally of the tyrants rage and related with tears the brutal outrage she had suffered when he last left her though i abhorred him said she i yet kneeled before him for thee let me bend in reverence to that power at whose look the whirlwinds are silent and the seas are calm that his fury has hitherto been restrained from hurting thee  at these words the face of almoran was again covered with the blushes of confusion to be still beloved only as hamet and as almoran to be still hated to be thus reproached without anger and wounded by those who knew not that they struck him was a species of misery peculiar to himself and had been incurred only by the acquisition of new powers which he had requested and received as necessary to obtain that felicity which the parsimony of nature had placed beyond his reach his emotions however as by almeida they were supposed to be the emotions of hamet she imputed to a different cause as heaven says she has preserved thee from death so has it for thy sake preserved me from violation almoran whose passion had in this interval again surmounted his remorse gazed eagerly upon her and catching her to his bosom let us at least says he secure the happiness that is now offered let not these inestimable moments pass by us unimproved but to show that we deserve them let them be devoted to love let us then said almeida escape together to escape with thee said almoran is impossible i shall retire and like the shaft of arabia leave no mark behind me but the flight of almeida will at once be traced to him by whom i was admitted and i shall thus retaliate his friendship with destruction let him then said almeida be the partner of our flight urge it not now said almoran but trust to my prudence and my love to select some hour that will be more favorable to our purpose and yet said he even then we shall as now sigh in vain for the completion of our wishes by whom shall our hands be joined when in the opinion of the priests it has been forbidden from above save thyself then said almeida and leave me to my fate not so said almoran what else replied almeida is in our power it is in our power said almoran to seize that joy to which a public form can give us no new claim for the public form can only declare that right by which i claim it now  as they were now reclining upon a sofa he threw his arm round her but she suddenly sprung up and burst from him the tear started to her eye and she gazed upon him with an earnest but yet tender look is it says she  no sure it is not the voice of hamet o yes said almoran what other voice should call thee to cancel at once the wrongs of hamet and almeida to secure the treasures of thy love from the hand of the robber to hide the joys which if now we lose we may lose for ever in the sacred and inviolable stores of the past and place them beyond the power not of almoran only but of fate with this wild effusion of desire he caught her again to his breast and finding no resistance his heart exulted in his success but the next moment to the total disappointment of his hopes he perceived that she had fainted in his arms when she recovered she once more disengaged herself from him and turning away her face she burst into tears when her voice could be heard she covered herself with her veil and turning again toward him all but this said she i had learnt to bear and how has this been deserved by almeida of hamet you was my only solace in distress and when the tears have stolen from my eyes in silence and in solitude i thought on thee i thought upon the chaste ardour of thy sacred friendship which was softened refined and exalted into love this was my hoarded treasure and the thoughts of possessing this soothed all my anguish with a misers happiness who blessed in the consciousness of hidden wealth despises cold and hunger and rejoices in the midst of all the miseries that make poverty dreadful this was my last retreat but i am now desolate and forlorn and my soul looks round with terror for that refuge which it can never find find that refuge said almoran in me alas said almeida can he afford me refuge from my sorrows who for the guilty pleasures of a transient moment would for ever sully the purity of my mind and aggravate misfortune by the consciousness of guilt  as almoran now perceived that it was impossible by any importunity to induce her to violate her principles he had nothing more to attempt but to subvert them when said he shall almeida awake and these dreams of folly and superstition vanish that only is virtue by which happiness is produced and whatever produces happiness is therefore virtue and the forms and words and rites which priests have pretended to be required by heaven are the fraudful arts only by which they govern mankind  almeida by this impious insult was roused from grief to indignation as thou have now dared said she to deride the laws which thou would first have broken so have thou broken for ever the tender bonds by which my soul was united to thine such as i fondly believed thee thou art not and what thou art i have never loved i have loved a delusive phantom only which while i strove to grasp it has vanished from me almoran attempted to reply but on such a subject neither her virtue nor her wisdom would permit debate that prodigy said she which i thought was the sleight of cunning or the work of sorcery i now revere as the voice of heaven which as it knew thy heart has in mercy saved me from thy arms to the will of heaven shall my will be obedient and my voice also shall pronounce to almoran almeida  almoran whose whole soul was now suspended in attention conceived new hopes of success and foresaw the certain accomplishment of his purpose though by an effect directly contrary to that which he had labored to produce thus to have incurred the hatred of almeida in the form of hamet was more fortunate than to have taken advantage of her love the path that led to his wishes was now clear and open and his marriage with almeida in his own person waited only ill he could resume it he therefore instead of soothing provoked her resentment if thou have loved a phantom said he which existed only in imagination on such a phantom my love also has been fixed thou have indeed only the form of what i called almeida my love thou have rejected because thou have never loved the object of thy passion was not hamet but a throne and thou have made the observance of rituals in which folly only can suppose there is good or ill a pretense to violate thy faith that thou may still gratify thy ambition  to this injurious reproach almeida made no reply and almoran immediately quitted her apartment that he might reassume his own figure and take advantage of the disposition which under the appearance of hamet he had produced in favor of himself but osmyn who supposing him to be hamet had intercepted and detained him as he was going to almeida now intercepted him a second time at his return having placed himself near the door of the apartment for that purpose  osmyn was by no means satisfied with the issue of their last interview he had perceived a perturbation in the mind of almoran for which imagining him to be hamet he could not account and which seemed more extraordinary upon a review than when it happened he therefore again entered into conversation with him in which he farther disclosed his sentiments and designs almoran notwithstanding the impatience natural to his temper and situation was thus long detained listening to osmyn by the united influence of his curiosity and his fears his enquiries still alarmed him with new terrors by discovering new objects of distrust and new instances of disaffection still however he resolved not yet to remove osmyn from his post that he might give no alarm by any appearance of suspicion and consequently learn with more ease and detect with more certainty any project that might be formed against him  chap xvi almeida as soon as she was left alone began to review the scene that had just past and was every moment affected with new wonder grief and resentment she now deplored her own misfortune and now conceived a design to punish the author of it from whose face she supposed the hand of adversity had torn the mask under which he had deceived her it appeared to her very easy to take a severe revenge upon hamet for the indignity which she supposed he had offered her by complaining of it to almoran and telling him that he had gained admittance to her by bribing the eunuch who kept the door the thought of thus giving him up was one moment rejected as arising from a vindictive spirit and the next indulged as an act of justice to almoran and a punishment due to the hypocrisy of hamet to the first she inclined when her grief which was still mingled with a tender remembrance of the man she loved was predominant and to the last when her grief gave way to indignation  thus are we inclined to consider the same action either as a virtue or a vice by the influence of different passions which prompt us either to perform or to avoid it almeida from deliberating whether she should accuse hamet to almoran or conceal his fault was led to consider what punishment he would either incur or escape in consequence of her determination and the images that rushed into her mind the moment this became the object of her thoughts at once determined her to be silent could i bear to see said she that hand which has so often trembled with delight when it enfolded mine convulsed and black those eyes that as often as they gazed upon me were dissolved in tears of tenderness and love start from the sockets and those lips that breathed the softest sighs of elegant desire distorted and gasping in the convulsions of death  from this image her mind recoiled in an agony of terror and pity her heart sunk within her her limbs trembled she sunk down upon the sofa and burst into tears  by this time hamet on whose form the likeness of almoran was still impressed had reached the palace he went instantly toward the apartment of the women instead of that cheerful alacrity that mixture of zeal and reverence and affection which his eye had been used to find wherever it was turned he now observed confusion anxiety and terror whoever he met made haste to prostrate themselves before him and feared to look up till he was past he went on however with a hasty pace and coming up to the eunuchs guard he said with an impatient tone to almeida the slave immediately made way before him and conducted him to the door of the apartment which he would not otherwise have been able to find and for which he could not directly enquire  when he entered his countenance expressed all the passions that his situation had roused in his mind he first looked sternly round him to see whether almoran was not present and then fetching a deep sigh he turned his eyes with a look of mournful tenderness upon almeida his first view was to discover whether almoran had already supplanted him and for this purpose he collected the whole strength of his mind he considered that he appeared now not as hamet but as almoran and that he was to question almeida concerning almoran while she had mistaken him for hamet he was therefore to maintain the character at whatever expense till his doubts were resolved and his fears either removed or confirmed he was so firmly persuaded that almoran had been there before him that he did not ask the question but supposed the fact he restrained alike both his tenderness and his fears and looking earnestly upon almeida who had risen up in his presence with blushes and confusion to me says he is almeida still cold and has she lavished all her love upon hamet  at the name of hamet the blushes and confusion of almeida increased her mind was still full of the images which had risen from the thought of what hamet might suffer if almoran should know that he had been with her and though she feared that their interview was discovered yet she hoped it might be only suspected and in that case the removal or confirmation of the suspicions on which the fate of hamet depended would devolve upon her  in this situation she who had but a few moments before doubted whether she should not voluntarily give him up when nothing more was necessary for his safety than to be silent now determined with whatever reluctance to secure him though it could not be done without dissimulation and though it was probable that in this dissimulation she would be detected instead therefore of answering the question she repeated it on whom said my lord on hamet hamet whose suspicions were increased by the evasion replied with great emotion aye on hamet did he not this moment leave you leave me this moment said almeida with yet greater confusion and deeper blushes hamet in the impatience of his jealousy concluded that the passions which he saw expressed in her countenance and which arose from the struggle between her regard to truth and her tenderness for hamet proceeded from the consciousness of what he had most reason to dread and she to conceal a breach of virtue to which she had been betrayed by his own appearance united with the vices of his brother he therefore drew back from her with a look of inexpressible anguish and stood some time silent she observed that in his countenance there was more expression of trouble than rage she therefore hoped to divert him from persuing his enquiries by at once removing his jealousy which she supposed would be at an end as soon as she should disclose the resolution she had taken in his favor addressing him therefore as almoran with a voice which though it was gentle and soothing was yet mournful and tremulous do not turn from me said she with those unfriendly and frowning looks give me now that love which so lately you offered and with all the future i will atone the past  upon hamet whose heart involuntarily answered to the voice of almeida these words had irresistible and instantaneous force but recollecting in a moment whose from he bore and to whom they were addressed they struck him with new astonishment and increased the torments of his mind supposing what he at first feared had happened and that almoran had seduced her as hamet he could not account for her now addressing him as almoran with words of favor and compliance he therefore renewed his enquiries concerning himself with apprehensions of a different kind she who was still solicitous to put an end to the enquiry as well for the sake of hamet as to prevent her own embarrassment replied with a sigh let not thy peace be interrupted by one thought of hamet for of hamet almeida shall think no more hamet who though he had fortified himself against whatever might have happened to her person could not bear the alienation of her mind cried out with looks of distraction and a voice scarcely human not think of hamet almeida whose astonishment was every moment increasing replied with a tender and interesting enquiry is almoran then offended that almeida should think of hamet no more hamet being thus addressed by the name of his brother again recollected his situation and now first conceived the idea that the alteration of almeidas sentiments with respect to himself might be the effect of some violence offered her by almoran in his likeness he therefore recurred to his first purpose and determined by a direct enquiry to discover whether she had seen him under that appearance this enquiry he urged with the utmost solemnity and ardour in terms suitable to his present appearance and situation tell me said he have these doors been open to hamet has he obtained possession of that treasure which by the voice of heaven has been allotted to me  to this double question almeida answered by a single negative and her answer therefore was both false and true it was true that her person was still inviolate and it was true also that hamet had not been admitted to her yet her denial of it was false for she believed the contrary almoran only had been admitted but she had received him as his brother hamet however was satisfied with the answer and did not discover its fallacy he looked up to heaven with an expression of gratitude and joy and then turning to almeida swear then said he that thou have granted to hamet no pledge of thy love which should be reserved for me almeida who now thought nothing more than the asseveration necessary to quiet his mind immediately complied i swear said she that to hamet i have given nothing which thou would wish me to withold the power that has devoted my person to thee has disunited my heart from hamet whom i renounce in thy presence for ever  hamet whose fortitude and recollection were again overborne was thrown into an agitation of mind which discovered itself by looks and gestures very different from those which almeida had expected and overwhelmed her with new confusion and disappointment that he who had so lately solicited her love with all the vehemence of a desire impatient to be gratified should now receive a declaration that she was ready to comply with marks of distress and anger was a mystery which she could not solve in the mean time the struggle in his breast became every moment more violent where then said he is the constancy which you vowed to hamet and for what instance of his love is he now forsaken  almeida was now more embarrassed than before she felt all the force of the reproof supposing it to have been given by almoran and she could be justified only by relating the particular which at the expense of her sincerity she had determined to conceal almoran was now exalted in her opinion while his form was animated by the spirit of hamet as much as hamet had been degraded while his form was animated by the spirit of almoran in his resentment of her perfidy to his rival though it favored his fondest and most ardent wishes there was an abhorrence of vice and a generosity of mind which she supposed to have been incompatible with his character to his reproach she could reply only by complaint and could no otherwise evade his question than by observing the inconsistency of his own behavior your words said she are daggers to my heart you condemn me for a compliance with your own wishes and for obedience to that voice which you supposed to have revealed the will of heaven has the caprice of desire already wandered to a new object and do you now seek a pretense to refuse when it is freely offered what so lately you would have taken by force  hamet who was now fired with resentment against almeida whom yet he could not behold without desire and who at the same moment was impatient to revenge his wrongs upon almoran was suddenly prompted to satisfy all his passions by taking advantage of the wiles of almoran and the perfidy of almeida to defeat the one and to punish the other it was now in his power instantly to consummate his marriage as a priest might be procured without a moments delay and as almeidas consent was already given he would then obtain the possession of her person by the very act in which she perfidiously resigned it to his rival to whom he would then leave the beauties he had already possessed and cast from him in disdain as united with a mind that he could never love as his imagination was fired with the first conception of this design he caught her to his breast with a fury in which all the passions in all their rage were at once concentered let the priest said he instantly unite us let us comprize in one moment in this instant now our whole of being and exclude alike the future and the past then grasping her still in his arms he looked up to heaven ye powers said he invisible but yet present who mould my changing and unresisting form prolong but for one hour that mysterious charm that is now upon me and i will be ever after subservient to your will  almeida who was terrified at the furious ardor of this unintelligible address shrunk from his embrace pale and trembling without power to reply hamet gazed tenderly upon her and recollecting the purity and tenderness with which he had loved her his virtues suddenly recovered their force he dismissed her from his embrace and turning from her he dropped in silence the tear that started to his eye and expressed in a low and faultering voice the thoughts that rushed upon his mind no said he hamet shall still disdain the joy which is at once sordid and transient in the breast of hamet lust shall not be the pander of revenge shall i who have languished for the pure delight which can arise only from the interchange of soul with soul and is endeared by mutual confidence and complacency shall i snatch under this disguise which belies my features and degrades my virtue a casual possession of faithless beauty which i despise and hate let this be the portion of those that hate me without a cause but let this be far from me at this thought he felt a sudden elation of mind and the conscious dignity of virtue that in such a conflict was victorious rendered him in this glorious moment superior to misfortune his gesture became calm and his countenance sedate he considered the wrongs he suffered not as a sufferer but as a judge and he determined at once to discover himself to almeida and to reproach her with her crime he remarked her confusion without pity as the effect not of grief but of guilt and fixing his eyes upon her with the calm severity of a superior and offended being such said he is the benevolence of the almighty to the children of the dust that our misfortunes are like poisons antidotes to each other  almeida whose faculties were now suspended by wonder and expectation looked earnestly at him but continued silent thy looks said hamet are full of wonder but as yet thy wonder has no cause in comparison of that which shall be revealed thou know the prodigy which so lately parted hamet and almeida i am that hamet thou art that almeida almeida would now have interrupted him but hamet raised his voice and demanded to be heard at that moment said he wretched as i am the child of error and disobedience my heart repined in secret at the destiny which had been written upon my head for i then thought thee faithful and constant but if our hands had been then united i should have been more wretched than i am for i now know that thou art fickle and false to know thee though it has pierced my soul with sorrow has yet healed the wound which was inflicted when i lost thee and though i am now compelled to wear the form of almoran whose vices are this moment disgracing mine yet in the balance i shall be weighed as hamet and i shall suffer only as i am found wanting  almeida whose mind was now in a tumult that bordered upon distraction bewildered in a labyrinth of doubt and wonder and alike dreading the consequence of what she heard whether it was false or true was yet impatient to confute or confirm it and as soon as she had recovered her speech urged him for some token of the prodigy he asserted which he might easily have given by relating any of the incidents which themselves only could know but just at this moment almoran having at last disengaged himself from osmyn by whom he had been long detained resumed his own figure and while the eyes of almeida were fixed upon hamet his powers were suddenly taken from him and restored in an instant and she beheld the features of almoran vanish and gazed with astonishment upon his own thy features change said she and thou indeed art hamet the sudden trance said he has restored me to myself and from my wrongs where shall thou be hidden this reproach was more than she could sustain but he caught her as she was falling and supported her in his arms this incident renewed in a moment all the tenderness of his love while he beheld her distress and pressed her by the embrace that sustained her to his bosom he forgot every injury which he supposed she had done him and perceived her recover with a pleasure that for a moment suspended the sense of his misfortunes  her first reflection was upon the snare in which she had been taken and her first sensation was joy that she had escaped she saw at once the whole complication of events that had deceived and distressed her and nothing more was now necessary than to explain them to hamet which however she could not do without discovering the insincerity of her answers to the enquiries which he had made while she mistook him for his brother if in my heart says she thou have found any virtue let it incline thee to pity the vice that is mingled with it by the vice i have been ensnared but i have been delivered by the virtue almoran for now i know that it was not thee almoran when he possessed thy form was with me he profaned thy love by attempts to supplant my virtue i resisted his importunity and escaped perdition but the guilt of almoran drew my resentment upon hamet i thought the vices which under thy form i discovered in his bosom were thine and in the anguish of grief indignation and disappointment my heart renounced thee yet as i could not give thee up to death i could not discover to almoran the attempt which i imputed to thee when you questioned me therefore as almoran i was betrayed to dissimulation by the tenderness which still melted my heart for hamet i believe thee said hamet catching her in a transport to his breast i love thee for thy virtue and may the pure and exalted beings who are superior to the passions that now throb in my heart forgive me if i love thee also for thy fault yet let the danger to which it betrayed thee teach us still to walk in the strait path and commit the keeping of our peace to the almighty for he that wanders in the maze of falsehood shall pass by the good that he would meet and shall meet the evil that he would shun i also was tempted but i was strengthened to resist if i had used the power which i derived from the arts that have been practiced against me to return evil for evil if i had not disdained a secret and unavowed revenge and the unhallowed pleasures of a brutal appetite i might have possessed thee in the form of almoran and have wronged irreparably myself and thee for how could i have been admitted as hamet to the beauties which i had enjoyed as almoran and how could thou have given to almoran what in reality had been appropriated by hamet  chap xvii but while almeida and hamet were thus congratulating each other upon the evils which they had escaped they were threatened by others which however obvious they had overlooked  almoran who was now exulting in the prospect of success that had exceeded his hopes and who supposed the possession of almeida before the end of the next hour was as certain as that the next hour would arrive suddenly entered the apartment but upon discovering hamet he started back astonished and disappointed hamet stood unmoved and regarded him with a fixed and steady look that at once reproached and confounded him what treachery said almoran has been practiced against me what has brought thee to this place and how have thou gained admittance against thy peace said hamet no treachery has been practiced but by thyself by those arts in which thy vices have employed the powers of darkness i have been brought hither and by those arts i have gained admittance thy form which they have imposed upon me was my passport and by the restoration of my own i have detected and disappointed the fraud which the double change was produced to execute almeida whom as hamet thou could teach to hate thee it is now impossible that as almoran thou should teach to love  almeida who perceived the storm to be gathering which the next moment would burst upon the head of hamet interposed between them and addressed each of them by turns urging hamet to be silent and conjuring almoran to be merciful almoran however without regarding almeida or making any reply to hamet struck the ground with his foot and the messengers of death to whom the signal was familiar appeared at the door almoran then commanded them to seize his brother with a countenance pale and livid and a voice that was broken by rage hamet was still unmoved but almeida threw herself at the feet of almoran and embracing his knees was about to speak but he broke from her with sudden fury if the world should sue said he i would spurn it off there is no pang that cunning can invent which he shall not suffer and when death at length shall disappoint my vengeance his mangled limbs shall be cast out unburied to feed the beasts of the desert and the fowls of heaven during this menace almeida sunk down without signs of life and hamet struggling in vain for liberty to raise her from the ground she was carried off by some women who were called to her assistance  in this awful crisis hamet who felt his own fortitude give way looked up and though he conceived no words a prayer ascended from his heart to heaven and was accepted by him to whom our thoughts are known while they are yet afar off for hamet the fountain of strength was opened from above his eye sparkled with confidence and his breast was dilated by hope he commanded the guard that were leading him away to stop and they implicitly obeyed he then stretched out his hand toward almoran whose spirit was rebuked before him hear me said he thou tyrant for it is thy genius that speaks by my voice what has been the fruit of all thy guilt but accumulated misery what joy have thou derived from undivided empire what joy from the prohibition of my marriage with almeida what good from that power which some evil demon has added to thy own what at this moment is thy portion but rage and anguish disappointment and despair even i whom thou see the captive of thy power whom thou have wronged of empire and yet more of love even i am happy in comparison of thee i know that my sufferings however multiplied are short for they shall end with life and no life is long then shall the everlasting ages commence and through everlasting ages thy sufferings shall increase the moment is now near when thou shall tread that line which alone is the path to heaven the narrow path that is stretched over the pit which smokes for ever and for ever when thine aching eye shall look forward to the end that is far distant and when behind thou shall find no retreat when thy steps shall faulter and thou shall tremble at the depth beneath which thought itself is not able to fathom then shall the angel of distribution lift his inexorable hand against thee from the irremeable way shall thy feet be smitten thou shall plunge in the burning flood and though thou shall live for ever thou shall rise no more  as the words of hamet struck almoran with terror and overawed him by an influence which he could not surmount hamet was forced from his presence before any other orders had been given about him than were implied in the menace that was addressed to almeida no violence therefore was yet offered him but he was secured till the kings pleasure should be known in a dungeon not far from the palace to which he was conducted by a subterraneous passage and the door being closed upon him he was left in silence darkness and solitude such as may be imagined before the voice of the almighty produced light and life  when almoran was sufficiently recollected to consider his situation he despaired of prevailing upon almeida to gratify his wishes till her attachment to hamet was irreparably broken and he therefore resolved to put him to death with this view he repeated the signal which convened the ministers of death to his presence but the sound was lost in a peal of thunder that instantly followed it and the genius from whom he received the talisman again stood before him  almoran said the genius i am now compelled into thy presence by the command of a superior power whom if i should dare to disobey the energy of his will might drive me in a moment beyond the limits of nature and the reach of thought to spend eternity alone without comfort and without hope and what said almoran is the will of this mighty and tremendous being his will said the genius i will reveal to thee hitherto thou have been enabled to lift the rod of adversity against thy brother by powers which nature has not entrusted to man as these powers and these only have put him into thy hand thou art forbidden to lift it against his life if thou had prevailed against him by thy own power thy own power would not have been restrained to afflict him thou art still free but thou art not permitted to destroy at the moment in which thou shall conceive a thought to cut him off by violence the punishment of thy disobedience shall commence and the pangs of death shall be upon thee if then said almoran this awful power is the friend of hamet what yet remains in the stores of thy wisdom for me till he dies i am at once precluded from peace and safety and enjoyment look up said the genius for the iron hand of despair is not yet upon thee thou can be happy only by his death and his life thou art forbidden to take away yet may thou still arm him against himself and if he dies by his own hand thy wishes will be full o name said almoran but the means and it shall this moment be accomplished select said the genius some friend   at the name of friend almoran started and looked round in despair he recollected the perfidy of osmyn and he suspected that from the same cause all were perfidious while hamet has yet life said he i fear the face of man as of a savage that is prowling for his prey relinquish not yet thy hopes said the genius for one in whom thou will joyfully confide may be found let him secretly obtain admittance to hamet as if by stealth let him profess an abhorrence of thy reign and compassion for his misfortunes let him pretend that the rack is even now preparing for him that death is inevitable but that torment may be avoided let him then give him a poignard as the instrument of deliverance and perhaps his own hand may strike the blow that shall give thee peace but who said almoran shall go upon this important errand who replied the genius but thyself have thou not the power to assume the form of whomsoever thou would have sent i would have sent osmyn said almoran but that i know him to be a traitor let the form of osmyn then said the genius be thine the shadows of the evening have now stretched themselves upon the earth command osmyn to attend thee alone in the grove where solomon thy father was used to meditate by night and when thy form shall be impressed upon him i will there seal his eyes in sleep till the charm shall be broken so shall no evil be attempted against thee and the transformation shall be known only to thyself  almoran whose breast was again illuminated by hope was about to express his gratitude and joy but the genius suddenly disappeared he began therefore immediately to follow the instructions that he had received he commanded osmyn to attend him in the grove and forbad every other to approach by the power of the talisman he assumed his appearance and saw him sink down in the supernatural slumber before him he then quitted the place and prepared to visit hamet in the prison  chap xviii the officer who commanded the guard that kept the gate of the prison was caled he was now next in trust and power to osmyn but as he had proposed a revolt to hamet in which osmyn had refused to concur he knew that his life was now in his power he dreaded lest for some slight offense or in some fit of causeless displeasure he should disclose the secret to almoran who would then certainly condemn him to death to secure this fatal secret and put an end to his inquietude he resolved from the moment that almoran was established upon the throne to find some opportunity secretly to destroy osmyn in this resolution he was confirmed by the enmity which inferior minds never fail to conceive against that merit which they cannot but envy without spirit to emulate and by which they feel themselves disgraced without an effort to acquire equal honor it was confirmed also by the hope which caled had conceived that upon the death of osmyn he should succeed to his post his apprehensions likewise were increased by the gloom which he remarked in the countenance of osmyn and which not knowing that it arose from fear he imputed to jealousy and malevolence  when almoran who had now assumed the appearance of osmyn had passed the subterranean avenue to the dungeon in which hamet was confined he was met by caled of whom he demanded admittance to the prince and produced his own signet as a testimony that he came with the authority of the king as it was caleds interest to secure the favor of osmyn till an opportunity should offer to cut him off he received him with every possible mark of respect and reverence and when he was gone into the dungeon he commanded a beverage to be prepared for him against he should return in which such spices were infused as might expel the malignity which in that place might be received with the breath of life and taking himself the key of the prison he waited at the door  when almoran entered the dungeon with a lamp which he had received from caled he found hamet sitting upon the ground his countenance was impressed with the characters of grief but it retained no marks either of anger or fear when he looked up and saw the features of osmyn he judged that the mutes were behind him and therefore rose up to prepare himself for death almoran beheld his calmness and fortitude with the involuntary praise of admiration yet persisted in his purpose without remorse i am come said he by the command of almoran to denounce that fate the bitterness of which i will enable thee to avoid and what is there said hamet in my fortunes that has prompted thee to the danger of this attempt the utmost that i can give thee said almoran i can give thee without danger to myself but though i have been placed by the hand of fortune near the person of the tyrant yet has my heart in secret been thy friend if i am the messenger of evil impute it to him only by whom it is devised the rack is now preparing to receive thee and every art of ingenious cruelty will be exhausted to protract and to increase the agonies of death and what said hamet can thy friendship offer me i can offer thee said almoran that which will at once dismiss thee to those regions where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary rest for ever he then produced the poignard from his bosom and presenting it to hamet take this said he and sleep in peace  hamet whose heart was touched with sudden joy at the sight of so unexpected a remedy for every evil did not immediately reflect that he was not at liberty to apply it he snatched it in a transport from the hand of almoran and expressed his sense of the obligation by clasping him in his arms and shedding the tears of gratitude in his breast be quick said almoran this moment i must leave thee and in the next perhaps the messengers of destruction may bind thee to the rack i will be quick said hamet and the sigh that shall last linger upon my lips shall bless thee they then bid each other farewell almoran retired from the dungeon and the door was again closed upon hamet  caled who waited at the door till the supposed osmyn should return presented him with the beverage which he had prepared of which he recounted the virtues and almoran received it with pleasure and having eagerly drank it off returned to the palace as soon as he was alone he resumed his own figure and sat with a confident and impatient expectation that in a short time a messenger would be dispatched to acquaint him with the death of hamet hamet in the mean time having grasped the dagger in his hand and raised his arm for the blow this said he is my passport to the realms of peace the immediate and only object of my hope but at these words his mind instantly took the alarm let me reflect said he a moment from what can i derive hope in death  from that patient and persevering virtue and from that alone by which we fulfill the task that is assigned us upon the earth is it not our duty to suffer as well as to act if my own hand consigns me to the grave what can it do but perpetuate that misery which by disobedience i would shun what can it do but cut off my life and hope together with this reflection he threw the dagger from him and stretching himself again upon the ground resigned himself to the disposal of the father of man most merciful and almighty  almoran who had now resolved to send for the intelligence which he longed to hear was dispatching a messenger to the prison when he was told that caled desired admittance to his presence at the name of caled he started up in an ecstasy of joy and not doubting but that hamet was dead he ordered him to be instantly admitted when he came in almoran made no enquiry about hamet because he would not appear to expect the event which yet he supposed he had brought about he therefore asked him only upon what business he came i come my lord said he to apprize thee of the treachery of osmyn i know said almoran that osmyn is a traitor but of what do thou accuse him as i was but now said he changing the guard which is set upon hamet osmyn came up to the door of the prison and producing the royal signet demanded admittance as the command which i received when he was delivered to my custody was absolute that no foot should enter i doubted whether the token had not been obtained by fraud for some other purpose yet as he required admittance only i complied but that if any treachery had been contrived i might detect it and that no artifice might be practiced to favor an escape i waited myself at the door and listening to their discourse i overheard the treason that i suspected what then said almoran did thou hear a part of what was said replied caled escaped me but i heard osmyn like a perfidious and presumptuous slave call almoran a tyrant i heard him profess an inviolable friendship for hamet and assure him of deliverance what were the means i know not but he talked of speed and supposed that the effect was certain  almoran though he was still impatient to hear of hamet and discovered that if he was dead his death was unknown to caled was yet notwithstanding rejoiced at what he heard and as he knew what caled told him to be true as the conversation he related had passed between himself and hamet he exulted in the pleasing confidence that he had yet a friend the glooms of suspicion which had involved his mind were dissipated and his countenance brightened with complacency and joy he had delayed to put osmyn to death only because he could appoint no man to succeed him of whom his fears did not render him equally suspicious but having now found in caled a friend whose fidelity had been approved when there had been no intention to try it and being impatient to reward his zeal and to invest his fidelity with that power which would render his services most important he took a ring from his own finger and putting it upon that of caled take this said he as a pledge that tomorrow osmyn shall lose his head and that from this moment thou art invested with his power  caled having in the conversation between almoran and hamet discerned indubitable treachery which he imputed to osmyn whose appearance almoran had then assumed eagerly seized the opportunity to destroy him he therefore not trusting to the event of his accusation had mingled poison in the bowl which he presented to almoran when he came out from hamet this however at first he had resolved to conceal  in consequence of his accusation he supposed osmyn would be questioned upon the rack he supposed also that the accusation as it was true would be confirmed by his confession that what ever he should then say to the prejudice of his accuser would be disbelieved and that when after a few hours the poison should take effect no inquisition would be made into the death of a criminal whom the bowstring or the scimitar would otherwise have been employed to destroy but he now hoped to derive new merit from an act of zeal which almoran had approved before it was known by condemning his rival to die whose death he had already insured may the wishes of my lord said he be always anticipated and may it be found that whatever he ordains is already done may he accept the zeal of his servant whom he has delighted to honor for before the light of the morning shall return the eyes of osmyn shall close in everlasting darkness  at these words the countenance of almoran changed his cheeks became pale and his lips trembled what then said he have thou done caled who was terrified and astonished threw himself upon the ground and was unable to reply almoran who now by the utmost effort of his mind restrained his confusion and his fear that he might learn the truth from caled without dissimulation or disguise raised him from the ground and repeated his enquiry if i have erred said caled impute it not when i had detected the treachery of osmyn i was transported by my zeal for thee for proof that he is guilty i appeal now to himself for he yet lives but that he might not escape the hand of justice i mingled in the bowl i gave him the drugs of death  at these words almoran striking his hands together looked upward in an agony of despair and horror and fell back upon a sofa that was behind him caled whose astonishment was equal to his disappointment and his fears approached him with a trembling though hasty pace but as he stooped to support him almoran suddenly drew his dagger and stabbed him to the heart and repeated the blow with reproaches and execrations till his strength failed him  in this dreadful moment the genius once more appeared before him at the sight of whom he waved his hand but was unable to speak nothing said the genius that has happened to almoran is hidden from me thy peace has been destroyed alike by the defection of osmyn and by the zeal of caled thy life may yet be preserved but it can be preserved only by a charm which hamet must apply almoran who had raised his eyes and conceived some languid hope when he heard that he might yet live cast them again down in despair when he heard that he could receive life only from hamet from hamet said he i have already taken the power to save me i have by thy counsel given him the instrument of death which by thy counsel also i urged him to use he received it with joy and he is now doubtless numbered with the dead hamet said the genius is not dead but from the fountain of virtue he drinks life and peace if what i shall propose he refuses to perform not all the powers of earth and sea and air if they should combine can give thee life but if he complies the death that is now suspended over thee shall fall upon his head and thy life shall be again delivered to the hand of time make haste then said almoran and i will here wait the event the event said the genius is not disstant and it is the last experiment which my power can make either upon him or thee when the star of the night that is now near the horizon shall set i will be with him  when almoran was alone he reflected that every act of supernatural power which the genius had enabled him to perform had brought upon him some new calamity though it always promised him some new advantage as he would not impute this disappointment to the purposes for which he employed the power that he had received he indulged a suspicion that it proceeded from the perfidy of the being by whom it was bestowed in his mind therefore he thus reasoned with himself the genius who has pretended to be the friend of almoran has been secretly in confederacy with hamet why else do i yet sigh in vain for almeida and why else did not hamet perish when his life was in my power by his counsel i persuaded hamet to destroy himself and in the very act i was betrayed to drink the potion by which i shall be destroyed i have been led on from misery to misery by ineffectual expedients and fallacious hopes in this crisis of my fate i will not trust with implicit confidence in another i will be present at the interview of this powerful but suspected being with hamet and who can tell but that if i detect a fraud i may be able to disappoint it however powerful he is not omniscient i may therefore be present unknown and unsuspected even by him in a form that i can choose by a thought to which he cannot be conscious  chap xix in consequence of this resolution almoran having commanded one of the soldiers of the guard that attended upon hamet into an inner room of the palace he ordered him to wait there till his return then making fast the door he assumed his figure and went immediately to the dungeon where producing his signet he said he had received orders from the king to remain with the prisoner till the watch expired  as he entered without speaking and without a light hamet continued stretched upon the ground with his face toward the earth and almoran having silently retired to a remote corner of the place waited for the appearance of the genius  the dawn of the morning now broke and in a few minutes the prison shook and the genius appeared he was visible by a lambent light that played around him and hamet starting from the ground turned to the vision with reverence and wonder but as the omnipotent was ever present to his mind to whom all beings in all worlds are obedient and on whom alone he relied for protection he was neither confused nor afraid hamet said the genius the crisis of thy fate is near who art thou said hamet and for what purpose art thou come i am replied the genius an inhabitant of the world above thee and to the will of thy brother my powers have been obedient upon him they have not conferred happiness but they have brought evil upon thee it was my voice that forbad thy marriage with almeida and my voice that decreed the throne to almoran i gave him the power to assume thy form and by me the hand of oppression is now heavy upon thee yet i have not decreed that he should be happy nor that thou should be wretched darkness as yet rests upon my purpose but my heart in secret is thy friend if thou art indeed my friend said hamet deliver me from this prison and preserve hamet for almeida thy deliverance said the genius must depend upon thyself there is a charm of which the power is great but it is by thy will only that this power can be exerted  the genius then held out toward him a scroll on which the seal of seven powers was impressed take said he this scroll in which the mysterious name of orosmades is written invoke the spirits that reside westward from the rising of the sun and northward in the regions of cold and darkness then stretch out thy hand and a lamp of sulphur self kindled shall burn before thee in the fire of this lamp consume that which i now give thee and as the smoke into which it changes shall mix with the air a mighty charm shall be formed which shall defend thee from all mischief from that instant no poison however potent can hurt thee nor shall any prison confine in one moment thou shall be restored to the throne and to almeida and the angel of death shall lay his hand upon thy brother to whom if i had confided this last best effort of my power he would have secured the good to himself and have transferred the evil to thee  almoran who had listened unseen to this address of the genius to hamet was now confirmed in his suspicions that evil had been ultimately intended against him and that he had been entangled in the toils of perfidy while he believed himself to be assisted by the efforts of friendship he was also convinced that by the genius he was not known to be present hamet however stood still doubtful and almoran was kept silent by his fears whoever thou art said hamet the condition of the advantages which thou have offered me is such as it is not lawful to fulfill these horrid rites and this commerce with unholy powers are prohibited to mortals in the law of life see thou to that said the genius good and evil are before thee that which i now offer thee i will offer no more  hamet who had not fortitude to give up at once the possibility of securing the advantages that had been offered and who was seduced by human frailty to deliberate at least upon the choice stretched out his hand and receiving the scroll the genius instantly disappeared that which had been proposed as a trial of his virtue almoran believed indeed to be an offer of advantage he had no hope therefore but that hamet would refuse the conditions and that he should be able to obtain the talisman and fulfill them himself he judged that the mind of hamet was in suspense and was doubtful to which side it might finally incline he therefore instantly assumed the voice and the person of omar that by the influence of his council he might be able to turn the scale  when the change was effected he called hamet by his name and hamet who knew the voice answered him in a transport of joy and wonder my friend said he my father in this dreary solitude in this hour of trial thou art welcome to my soul as liberty and life guide me to thee by thy voice and tell me while i hold thee to my bosom how and wherefore thou art come do not now ask me said almoran it is enough that i am here and that i am permitted to warn thee of the precipice on which thou stand it is enough that concealed in this darkness i have overheard the specious guile which some evil demon has practiced upon thee is it then certain said hamet that this being is evil is not that being evil said almoran who proposes evil as the condition of good shall i then said hamet renounce my liberty and life the rack is now ready and perhaps the next moment its tortures will be inevitable let me ask thee then said almoran to preserve thy life will thou destroy thy soul o stay said hamet  let me not be tried too far let the strength of him who is almighty be manifest in my weakness hamet then paused a few moments but he was no longer in doubt and almoran who disbelieved and despised the arguments by which he intended to persuade him to renounce what upon the same condition he was impatient to secure for himself conceived hopes that he should succeed and those hopes were instantly confirmed take then said hamet this unholy charm and remove it far from me as the sands of alai from the trees of oman lest in some dreadful hour my virtue may fail me and thy counsel may be wanting give it me then said almoran and feeling for the hands of each other he snatched it from him in an ecstasy of joy and instantly resuming his own voice and figure he cried out at length i have prevailed and life and love dominion and revenge are now at once in my hand  hamet heard and knew the voice of his brother with astonishment but it was too late to wish that he had withheld the charm which his virtue would not permit him to use yet a few moments pass said almoran and thou art nothing hamet who doubted not of the power of the talisman and knew that almoran had no principles which would restrain him from using it to his destruction resigned himself to death with a sacred joy that he had escaped from guilt almoran then with an elation of mind that sparkled in his eyes and glowed upon his cheek stretched out his hand in which he held the scroll and a lamp of burning sulphur was immediately suspended in the air before him he held the mysterious writing in the flame and as it began to burn the place shook with reiterated thunder of which every peal was more terrible and more loud hamet wrapping his robe round him cried out in the fountain of life that flows for ever let my life be mingled let me not be as if i had never been but still conscious of my being let me still glorify him from whom it is derived and be still happy in his love  almoran who was absorbed in the anticipation of his own felicity heard the thunder without dread as the proclamation of his triumph let thy hopes said he be thy portion and the pleasures that i have secured shall be mine as he pronounced these words he started as at a sudden pang his eyes became fixed and his posture immovable yet his senses still remained and he perceived the genius once more to stand before him almoran said he to the last founds which thou shall hear let thine ear be attentive of the spirits that rejoice to fulfill the purpose of the almighty i am one to hamet and to almoran i have been commissioned from above i have been appointed to perfect virtue by adversity and in the folly of her own projects to entangle vice the charm which could be formed only by guilt has power only to produce misery of every good which thou almoran would have secured by disobedience the opposite evil is thy portion and of every evil which thou hamet wast by obedience willing to incur the opposite good is bestowed upon thee to thee hamet are now given the throne of thy father and almeida and thou almoran who while i speak art incorporating with the earth shall remain through all generations a memorial of the truths which thy life has taught  at the words of the genius the earth trembled beneath and above the walls of the prison disappeared the figure of almoran which was hardened into stone expanded by degrees and a rock by which his form and attitude are still rudely expressed became at once a monument of his punishment and his guilt  such are the events recorded by acmet the descendant of the prophet and the preacher of righteousness for to acmet that which passed in secret was revealed by the angel of instruction that the world might know that to the wicked increase of power is increase of wretchedness and that those who condemn the folly of an attempt to defeat the purpose of a genius might no longer hope to elude the appointment of the most high  finis
