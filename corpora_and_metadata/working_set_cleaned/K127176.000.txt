to bristol the distance    miles one called the upper road and the other the lower the upper runs from the west end of the city along the northern side of the river and through a part of gloucestershire the lower and the most frequented winds along the southern bank of the river from the old bridge and a communication between these two roads is formed by a handsome stone bridge of one arch over the same river about two miles and a half below the town  passing then over the bridge the lower road  the vale of bath through which the avon runs is beautiful in all its parts and worth the travellers notice  proceeding on from newton we leave the village  before we reach keynsham we see a handsome house on the north this belongs to edward line esquire  keynsham is a small market town standing on two hills on the south bank of the avon with a small bridge over the river chew which runs by it the counties of gloucester and somerset are joined by a larger bridge over the avon

this description of the road from london to bath will serve to conduct the traveller from bath to london if he reads it from the end to the beginning and remembers that those places which in his way down to bath were represented to be on the right of the road in his way back must be on the left and vice versa  there is a second road to bath from london as i have observed to which i whould give the preference for many reasons in the first place it avoids the hills between marlborough and devizes and of course saves time upon the journey secondly being less frequented is not so dusty in summer or so much worn in winter thirdly a traveller is not so likely to be stopped by a run of postchaises or be obliged to go on with tired horses and lastly inns are not so expensive this road is through stains hartfordbridge basingstoke andover luggershal everley and devizes to bath this way is one mile more but the advantages more than compensate it the country is equally beautfl if we travel it in autumn we pass throuh weyhill fair the greatest in the kingdom and if we would dispense with a mile or two more on our journey and go through ambresbury instead of everley and devizes the road is good and we pass close by that superb piece of antiquity the druidical temple of stonehenge which every person of taste and curiosity goes to see and the road this way is not above two or three miles round  i know the bath road through reading has been admired for the good accommodations met with at the different inns but all inns are now improved and there are none that excel demesays at hartfordbridge and some others on the way indeed the accommodations at demesays are so excellent that the royal family sensible of it make a point always of dining or supping there in their journey to and from weymouth  if the traveller let him be of what cast he will wishes to be amused on his journey or at bath dr trusler ventures to recommend to his perusal the two following books they will afford him a fund of entertainment being full of laughable anecdote and make him acquainted with the arts finesse and deceptions of the age in all professions of life they are a true and very pointed
