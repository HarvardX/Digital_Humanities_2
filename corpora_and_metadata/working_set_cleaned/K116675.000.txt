a letter to the reverend mr dean swift etc  price three pence  a letter to the reverend mr dean swift occasioned by a satire said to be written by him entitled a dedication to a great man concerning dedications discovering among other wonderful secrets what will be the present posture of affairs a thousand years hence  by a sparkish pamphleteer of buttons coffeehouse  london printed for james roberts in warwick lane       a letter to the reverend mr dean swift etc dear doctor i thank you in the name of the public for your continuing to be useful notwithstanding you are a dignified churchman the celebrated lord falkland talking of the clergy in the house of commons said that as their preaching was the cause of their preferment so they made their preferment the cause of their not preaching and when i knew you were made a dean i grew in mortal fear that you would live like your brethren and be good for nothing i confess a deanary is a very good reason for being idle and we infer that you are of the same mind from your not having once set the three kingdoms alaughing in five years together whereas you used formerly when you had wit in pocketfulls and no money to be tickling the sides of mankind once a week at least what a misfortune is it that the rich man should always thus spoil the merry fellow  i my self find it by experience that plenty is a damned baulk to mirth for i am always dull in proportion to my cash and witty in proportion to the feebleness of my purse when i am master of a few half crowns you would swear by my looks and heaviness i were an elder brother or an alderman such a magisterial stupidity do i carry about me however for my comfort i am seldom attacked by this fit of lethargy above once a year  on the other hand when there is a famine in my fob my head is in the best plight in the world and i can write a pamphlet in half an hour nec onus nec fraenum a colt or a girl or a young cat has not more tricks and liveliness  one day i shall never forget it as i was raising a ghost or describing a monster or committing a horrid and bloody murder faith i cannot tell which but one of them it was and the press and the hawkers both stood still for it i say upon that selfsame day when i began with my usual elegance to flourish and form my periods i felt an unusual slowness in my invention and my fancy though i pumped it again and again and drew it by all its teats would not yield one drop of milk and i could not for the heart of me make my readers wonder  in this deplorable and neverenough to be lamented dullness what does me i do but search first in my noddle and then in my breeches for the strange ground of my present woe and unfruitfulness and to my great astonishment in a private corner of my pocket lurked a crooked sixpence unfelt till then by human finger the reason of its long imprisonment was that in many months i had never sent my hand on any message into my pocket as well knowing it had no business there  as soon as i had laid my hands on this single inhabitant i resolved to make an example of him and drowned him immediately without mercy in half a pint of sherry i then went readily and cheerfully to work and having now neither let nor molestation finished my ghost with good reputation to my self for it was reckoned the very best and most terrible apparition that haunted grubstreet that evening  i have not met with such another obstacle in all the numerous pamphlets which i have since produced while i have any cash i neither think nor speak nor write but ramble and drink and pay and when i can pull out no more money i pull out my inkhorn and grow witty again n b for three weeks past i have been a wit without interruption  i appeal to you dear doctor whether the case which i have been here describing was not once yours while your circumstances were yet but lean and your purse greyhoundgutted  i was therefore not a little surpised to find you writing in spite of your gold and your deanary i at first imagined there might be a general famine in ireland and that you were reduced to dine upon your wit again but the mirth and festivity of your book relieved me instantly from all apprehension of this kind and i have since considered you as only venting your spleen against a piece of fulsome roguery which continues still to go on in shameless luxuriancy  generally speaking you can as easily grope out color and complextion with your fingers and pore into the nature of harmony with your eyes as discover the characters of great persons in the descriptions which are made of them in dedications  your essay upon that subject was certainly very useful and seasonable and i think you are owned to have executed it with just wit and severity  will the quality never see that in these panegyricks which authors sell them they are first belied and then cheated the language in most of those cases is in truth no other than this  my lord give me  0 guineas and i will deceive you every man who is decked in a character which does not become him is so far dressed in a fools coat and cap and exposed to the grin and contempt of all that can see it that is every body but himself  fame is a fleeting tender thing and even where it is due it is lost or corrupted when bestowed by improper or mercenary hands  i knew a pretty young girl in a country village who overfond of her own praise became a property to a poor rogue in the parish who was ignorant of all things but fawning this fellow used to wait on mrs betty every morning and she being a shopkeeper his usual salutation was lord love your heart mrs betty you be main handsome will you give me a pipe of tobacco am i isaac answers mrs betty let me see your box and then she fills it thus isaac extolls her out of a quartern of cut and dry every day she lives and though the young woman is really handsome she and her beauty are become a byword and all the country round she is called nothing but isaacs best virginia  there is but one way of carrying flattery to a greater height than it is already arrived to all patrons have been time out of mind perfectly wise perfectly just perfectly valiant perfectly witty and perfectly beautiful all patrons are so because all authors have said so now what remains to be done for the improvement of flattery even this let the poet buckle himself in armor and mounting a mettld steed sally forth into the streets and highways and challenge to single combat any bold varlet who dare assert that all the rest of the world are in the least degree comparable for virtue and beauty and all that to one single lord or lady who is perhaps if known despised by all the rest of the world  i expect the thanks of our authors for this hint of mine which yet i have borrowed from themselves considering what several of them have threatened long ago and do upon occasion still threaten i have waited a good while to see them grasp the lance and fall into the immediate practice of this piece of authorerrantry after having most humbly invoked his grace or her ladyship to be propitious etc  says one author   i know sir your modesty will be tortured by what i have here asserted but i am resolved to maintain my point to the last drop of my pen  this author i doubt carried his quixotism too far he threatens to attack the noble squire himself in defense of the noble squire himself  another runs his head against the universe in behalf of his lord and patron and cries  my lord  in spite of the growlings of an envious world i will maintain it in the face of mankind that your lordship is in all respects the only most  and most  and most  and most  and most     he goes on in telling a great many more lies which i do not care to repeat you see he makes a curr of the universe and sets it agrowling at my lord who is a much greater man than mr universe himself and then he threatens to run mankind through the body if they do not own with him that my lord is in all respects the sweetest creature in the three parishes  a third boldly pronounces   this character which i have drawn of your grace i will stand by and support while i have life or limb this was a sheauthor and whether by her supporting and her limbs she did not mean bawdy i am not sure but i think the meaning of the next is plain when she tells her youthful peer that though he had committed sufficient ravages among the sex yet the loveliness of his looks and the firmness of his make made her conclude he was but beginning  in this manner it is that you poets and parsons create gods and invent religions and then force us that are but laymen and readers to worship the one and submit to the other on pain of being damned and knocked down  and it is most natural in the business of falsehood and forgery for those that have an interest in their maintenance to appear as much as is possible in great earnest and in order to it to punish and inveigh against all that dare see so well as to distinguish the monstrous features and deformities of your deities and doctrines  suppose now i cannot with all my optics perceive that the eyes of a certain earl are so very brillant or that the ceremonies of a certain church are so very decent you must to be consistent with your selves and of importance with the multitude censure and destroy me for being an obstinate enemy to the church and the earl for should the people by hearing my reasons come to embrace my opinions it might be my turn next to direct and govern your seeing and your believing  i should not dear doctor have fallen into these reflections here had it not come suddenly into my mind that they are not unlike those i have heard you make formerly before you were convinced and converted by a deanary  some have wondered how doctor swift whose affection to the church was never doubted though his christianity was ever questioned should think the worse of some of the clergy for their trampling upon loyalty and oaths and for all his reverence for the late q  and her counselors should make such honorable mention of king george and his ministers but as it is well known you never were a slave to constancy and principle we can easily account for this your behavior and in defense of it say that in this instance you have put off prejudice and resumed your understanding  besides this others allege that your panegyric is contradictory to your banter upon dedications but this you have your self answered in your preface to the fourth edition in which you have the following lines  as to the characters and inscriptions at the end i still think them so just that i am not like to repent of them which may serve to show me as much a friend to wellgrounded panegyric as i ever shall be a foe to all false coloring there is no such thing as praise and blame where they are not applied and as i take upon me to expose the one i think i need ask no pardon for attempting to practice the other  it remains now for me to entertain you with some remarks on the present state of this town which no man knew some years ago better than your self  and to begin with that which with gentlemen of your faculty claims precedence of the king himself the good church of england i am sorry to tell you she is in the same puny complaining condition which you mr dean left her in and languishes so immoderately that if she do not very shortly kick up her reverend heel and depart this established life your brethren the parsons are false prophets for they have not only with one mouth predicted her downfall these thirty years but are at this very juncture preaching the paralytick old ladys funeraloration every sunday that passes so that if she be not already stonedead there is no believing the cassock  the spreading of reports that the king is in danger or dead is generally if not always taken as a mark of disaffection and as such punishable if the forging of tales concerning the danger of the church may be judged by the like rule i doubt most of her pious sons will be found errant bastards  the present tottering state of that venerable matron proceeds from the dreadful power which a new act of parliament gives to old women to teach children to read from hence it is orthodoxly concluded that the said old women will like giants and generals head an army of infants armed with psalters and hornbooks against the hierarchy add to all this another terrible circumstance a man may now venture to hear tom bradbury without being ruined by the forfeiture of his place and the neglected priesthood can have no other vengeance upon such a delinquent but barely cursing him  a quaker in kent when he was pressed by a zealous tory to conform to the established church made this roguish reasonable answer friend thee may spare thy breath and persuasion i will never be of that church which is always in danger and some people as arch and atheistical as our quaker are ready to tell you that neither their principles nor their noses will allow them to communicate with a church which if our latest advices from the pulpit be true is already stinking in her sepulcher  the right reverend and right learned lord bishop of london differs from many of his clergy upon this head and seems of opinion that the established church has still some existence  this orthodox primitive bishop has lately writ a perspicuous and persuasive epistle to the priests of his diocese and in it warns them with a paternal tenderness against the new doxologies of ancient heretics besides he tells them that if they neglect their duty to god and the king they are liable to pay five pounds and his lordship no doubt knew what arguments were like to be of most force with them  we have had lately two new plays one is sir walter raleigh a tragedy it is acted with good applause at the new house its own native worth hiding in a good degree the insufficiency of some of the actors you will find in it many beautiful thoughts and lines  the other is a new play of an ancient poet it is called the masquerade and acted in drury lane it filled the house a few nights with people and hissing but that theater never fails having a large audience though they act charles johnson or tom thumb  this winter has produced but few pamphlets which the town has vouchsafed to smile on you know to be sure what acceptance your essay upon dedications has met with and there is an apology for parson alberoni which has already run to the ninth edition this little book is such a thorn in the sides of the clergy that it is every where taken for granted you are the author of it so that you are this year as you used to be at the head of all the pamphleteers in great britain  i am just now told that the right honorable the players and privy counselors in the old house have found out that they are a ministry within themselves and have notifyd the same in form to my lord chamberlain by the mouth of their plenipo and copyer in chief the well bred mr colley cibber but i hear his grace frowns upon these actors of state and is almost provoked to shut up their palace because they were saucy to him and pleaded their patent for it  vice and dullness dear doctor never reigned more irresistibly than they do at the very time of the signing and sealing hereof our wits leave us in pairs grath and row are just gone and others of their spirit and genius are in a fair way to follow them but debauchery beaus and insolence gather ground and numbers for my part i cannot help foreseeing and dreading the day when it will be as unfashionable to be witty as it is now to be goodnatured or sober  i am dear doctor your friend and servant p a covent garden jan  0
