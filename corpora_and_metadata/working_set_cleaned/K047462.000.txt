the profoundest respect sir your most devoted and most faithful humble servant james thomson  winter a poem see winter comes to rule the varied year sullen and sad with all his rising train vapors and clouds and storms be these my theme these that exalt the soul to solemn thought and heavenly musing welcome kindred glooms wished wintry horrors hail  with frequent foot pleased have i in my cheerful morn of life when nursed by careless solitude i lived and sung of nature with unceasing joy pleased have i wandered through your rough domains trod the pure virgin snows my self as pure heard the winds roar and the big torrent burst or seen the deep fermenting tempest brewed in the red evening sky  thus passed the time till through the opening chambers of the south looked out the joyous spring looked out and smiled thee too inspirer of the toiling swain fair autumn yellow robbed i will sing of thee of thy last tempered days and sunny calms when all the golden hours are on the wing attending thy retreat and round thy wain slowrolling onward to the southern sky behold the wellpoisd hornet hovering hangs with quivering pinions in the genial blaze flys off in airy circles then returns and hums and dances to the beating ray nor shall the man that musing walks alone and heedless strays within his radiant lists go unchastisd away  sometimes a fleece of clouds widescattering with a lucid veil soft shadow over the unruffled face of heaven and through their dewy sluices shed the sun with tempered influence down then is the time for those whom wisdom and whom nature charm to steal themselves from the degenerate crowd and soar above this little scene of things to tread lowthoughted vice beneath their feet to lay their passions in a gentle calm and woo lone quiet in her silent walks now solitary and in pensive guise often let me wander over the russet mead or through the pining grove where scarce is heard one dying strain to cheer the woodmans toil sad philomel perchance pours forth her plaint far through the withering copse mean while the leaves that late the forest clad with lively green nipt by the drizzly night and sallowhud fall wavering through the air or shower amain urged by the breeze that sobs amid the boughs then listening hares forsake the rusling woods and starting at the frequent noise escape to the rough stubble and the rushy fen then woodcocks over the fluctuating main that glimmers to the glimpses of the moon stretch their long voyage to the woodland glade where wheeling with uncertain flight they mock the nimble fowlers aim  now nature droops languish the living herbs with pale decay and all the various family of flowers their sunny robes resign the falling fruits through the still night forsake the parentbough that in the first gray glances of the dawn looks wild and wonders at the wintry waste the year yet pleasing but declining fast soft over the secret soul in gentle gales a philosophic melancholy breathes and bears the swelling thought aloft to heaven then forming fancy rouses to conceive what never mingled with the vulgars dream then wake the tender pang the pitying tear the sigh for suffering worth the wish preferred for humankind the joy to see them blessed and all the social offspring of the heart oh bear me then to high embowering shades to twilight groves and visionary vales to weeping grottos and to hoary caves where angelforms are seen and voices heard sighed in low whispers that abstract the soul from outward sense far into worlds remote now when the western sun withdraws the day and humid evening gliding over the sky in her chill progress checks the straggling beams and robs them of their gathered vapoury prey where marshes stagnate and where rivers wind cluster the rolling fogs and swim along the duskymantled lawn then slow descend once more to mingle with their watery friends the vivid stars shine out in radiant files and boundless either glows till the fair moon shows her broad visage in the crimsoned east now stooping seems to kiss the passing cloud now over the pure cerulean rides sublime wide the pale deluge floats with silver waves over the skyd mountain to the lowlaid vale from the white rocks with dim reflection gleams and faintly glitters through the waving shades all night abundant dews unnoted fall and at return of morning silver over the face of motherearth from every branch depending tremble the translucent gems and quivering seem to fall away yet cling and sparkle in the sun whose rising eye with fogs bedimd portends a beauteous day now giddy youth whom headlong passions fire rouse the wild game and stain the guiltless grove with violence and death yet call it sport to scatter ruin through the realms of love and peace that thinks no ill but these the muse whose charity unlimited extends as wide as nature works disdains to sing returning to her nobler theme in view  for see where winter comes himself confessed striding the gloomy blast first rains obscure drive through the mingling skies with tempest foul beat on the mountains brow and shake the woods that sounding wave below the dreary plain lies overwhelmed and lost the bellying clouds combine and deepening into night shut up the days fair face the wanderers of heaven each to his home retire save those that love to take their pastime in the troubled air and skimming flutter round the dimply flood the cattle from the untasted fields return and ask with meaning low their wonted stalls or ruminate in the contiguous shade thither the household feathery people crowd the crested cock with all his female train pensive and wet mean while the cottageswain hangs over the enlivening blaze and taleful there recounts his simple frolic much he talks and much he laughs nor recks the storm that blows without and rattles on his humble roof at last the muddy deluge pours along resistless roaring dreadful down it comes from the chapt mountain and the mossy wild tumbling through rocks abrupt and sounding far then over the sanded valley floating spreads calm sluggish silent till again constrained betwixt two meeting hills it bursts a way where rocks and woods oerhang the turbid stream there gathering triple force rapid and deep it boils and wheels and foams and thunders through nature great parent whose directing hand rolls round the seasons of the changeful year how mighty how majestic are thy works with what a pleasing dread they swell the soul that sees astonished and astonished sings you too ye winds that now begin to blow with boisterous sweep i raise my voice to you where are your stores ye viewless beings say where your aerial magazines reserved against the day of tempest perilous in what untraveld country of the air hushed in still silence sleep you when it is calm late in the louring sky red fiery streaks begin to flush about the reeling clouds stagger with dizzy aim as doubting yet which master to obey while rising slow sad in the leadencolourd east the moon wears a black circle round her fullyd orb then issues forth the storm with loud control and the thin fabric of the pillard air oerturns at once prone on the uncertain main descends the etherial force and plows its waves with dreadful rist from the middeep appears surge after surge the rising watery war whitening the angry billows roll immense and roar their terrors through the shuddering soul of feeble man amidst their fury caught and dashed upon his fate then over the cliff where dwells the seamew unconfined they fly and hurrying swallow up the steril shore the mountain growls and all its sturdy sons stoop to the bottom of the rocks they shade lone on its midnightside and all aghast the dark wayfaring stranger breathless toils and climbs against the blast  low waves the rooted forest vexed and sheds what of its leafy honors yet remains thus struggling through the dissipated grove the whirling tempest raves along the plain and on the cottage thacht or lordly dome keenfastening shakes em to the solid base sleep frighted flies the hollow chimney howls the windows rattle and the hinges creak then too they say through all the burdened air long groans are heard shrill sounds and distant sighs that murmured by the demon of the night warn the devoted wretch of woe and death wild uproar lords it wide the clouds commixt with stars swiftgliding sweep along the sky all nature reels  but hark the almighty speaks instant the chidden storm begins to pant and dies at once into a noiseless calm as yet it is midnights reign the weary clouds slowmeeting mingle into solid gloom now while the drousy world lies lost in sleep let me associate with the lowbrowd night and contemplation her sedate compeer let me shake off the intrusive cares of day and lay the meddling senses all aside and now ye lying vanities of life you evertempting evercheating train where are you now and what is your amount vexation disappointment and remorse sad sickening thought and yet deluded man a scene of wild disjointed visions past and broken slumbers rises still resolved with newflushd hopes to run your giddy round father of light and life thou good supreme o teach me what is good teach me thy self save me from folly vanity and vice from every low pursuit and feed my soul with knowledge conscious peace and virtue pure sacred substantial neverfading bliss lo from the livid east or piercing north thick clouds ascend in whose capacious womb a vapoury deluge lies to snow congealed heavy they roll their fleecy world along and the sky saddens with the impending storm through the hushed air the whitening shower descends at first thinwavering till at last the flakes fall broad and wide and fast dimming the day with a continual flow see sudden hoard the woods beneath the stainless burden bow blackning along the mazy stream it melts earths universal face deephid and chill is all one dazzling waste the labourerox stands covered over with snow and then demands the fruit of all his toil the fowls of heaven tamed by the cruel season crowd around the winnowing store and claim the little boon that providence allows the foodless wilds pour forth their brown inhabitants the hare though timorous of heart and hard beset by death in various forms dark snares and dogs and more unpitying men the garden seeks urged on by fearless want the bleating kind eye the bleak heavens and next the glistening earth with looks of dumb despair then sad dispersed dig for the withered herb through heaps of snow now shepherds to your helpless charge be kind baffle the raging year and fill their penns with food at will lodge them below the blast and watch them strict for from the bellowing east in this dire season often the whirlwinds wing sweeps up the burden of whole wintry plains in one fierce blast and over the unhappy flocks lodged in the hollow of two neighboring hills the billowy tempest whelms till upwards urged the valley to a shining mountain swells that curls its wreaths amid the freezing sky now all amid the rigours of the year in the wild depth of winter while without the ceaseless winds blow keen be my retreat a rural sheltered solitary scene where ruddy fire and beaming tapers join to chase the chearless gloom there let me sit and hold high converse with the mighty dead sages of ancient time as gods revered as gods beneficent who blessed mankind with arts and arms and humanizd a world roused at the inspring thought  i throw aside the longlived volume and deepmusing hail the sacred shades that slowlyrising pass before my wondering eyes  first socrates truths early champion martyr for his god solon the next who built his commonweal on equitys firm base lycurgus then severely good and him of rugged rome numa who softened her rapacious sons cimon sweetsould and aristides just unconquered cato virtuous in extreme with that attemperd timoleon hero mild and firm who wept the brother while the tyrant bled scipio the humane warrior gently brave fair learnings friend who early sought the shade to dwell with innocence and truth retired and equal to the best the theban he who single raised his country into fame thousands behind the boast of greece and rome whom virtue owns the tribute of a verse demand but who can count the stars of heaven who sing their influence on this lower world but see who yonder comes nor comes alone with sober state and of majestic mien the sistermuses in his train  it is he maro the best of poets and of men great homer too appears of daring wing parent of song and equal by his side the british muse joined hand in hand they walk darkling nor miss their way to fames ascent society divine immortal minds still visit thus my nights for you reserved and mount my soaring soul to deeds like yours silence thou lonely power the door be thine see on the hallowed hour that none intrude save lycidas the friend with sense refined learning digested well exalted faith unstudyd wit and humor ever gay clear frost succeeds and through the blew serene for sight too fine the aetherial nitre flies to bake the glebe and bind the slipry flood this of the wintry season is the prime pure are the days and lustrous are the nights brightened with starry worlds till then unseen mean while the orient darkly red breathes forth an icy gale that in its mid career arrests the bickering stream the nightly sky and all her glowing constellations pour their rigid influence down it freezes on till morn laterising over the drooping world lifts her pale eye unjoyous then appears the various labor of the silent night the pendant isicle the frostwork fair where thousand figures rise the crusted snow though white made whiter by the fining north on blithsome frolics bent the youthful swains while every work of man is laid at rest rush over the watery plains and shuddering view the fearful deeps below or with the gun and faithful spaniel range the ravaged fields and adding to the ruins of the year distress the feathery or the footed game but hark the nightly winds with hollow voice blow blustering from the south  the frost subdued gradual resolves into a weeping thaw spotted the mountains shine loose sleet descends and floods the country round the rivers swell impatient for the day  those sullen seas that wash the ungenial pole will rest no more beneath the shackles of the mighty north but rousing all their waves resistless heave  and hark  the lengthening roar continuous runs athwart the rifted main at once it bursts and piles a thousand mountains to the clouds ill fares the bark the wretches last resort that lost amid the floating fragments moors beneath the shelter of an icy isle while night oerwhelms the sea and horror looks more horrible can human hearts endure the assembled mischiefs that besiege them round unlistning hunger fainting weariness the roar of winds and waves the crush of ice now ceasing now renewed with louder rage and bellowing round the main nations remote shook from their midnightslumbers deem they hear portentous thunder in the troubled sky more to embroil the deep leviathan and his unweildy train in horrid sport tempest the loosened brine while through the gloom far from the dire unhospitable shore the lyons rage the wolfs sad howl is heard and all the fell society of night yet providence that everwaking eye looks down with pity on the fruitless toil of mortals lost to hope and lights them safe through all this dreary labyrinth of fate it is done  dread winter has subdued the year and reigns tremenduous over the desert plains how dead the vegetable kingdom lies how dumb the tuneful horror wide extends his solitary empire  now fond man behold thy pictured life pass some few years thy flowring spring thy shortlived summers thy sober autumn fading ito age and pale concluding winter shuts thy scene strength and shrouds thee in the grave  where now are fled those dreams of greatness those unsolid hopes of happiness those longings after fame those restless cares those busy bustling days those nights of secret guilt those veering thoughts fluttering twixt good and ill that shared thy life all now are vanished virtue sole survives immortal mankinds neverfailing friend his guide to happiness on high  and see it is come the glorious morn the second birth of heaven and earth  awakening nature hears the almighty trumpets voice and starts to life renewed unfading now the eternal scheme that dark perplexity that mystic maze which sight could never trace nor heart conceive to reasons eye refined clears up apace angels and men astonished pause  and dread to travel through the depths of providence untried unbounded ye vain learned see and prostrate in the dust adore that power and goodness often arraigned see now the cause why conscious worth oppressed in secret long mourned unregarded why the good mans share in life was gall and bitterness of soul why the lone widow and her orphans pined in starving solitude while luxury in palaces lay prompting her low thought to form unreal wants why heavenborn faith and charity prime grace wore the red marks of persecutions scourge why licensed pain that cruel spoiler that embosomd foe embittered all our bliss ye good distressed ye noble few that here unbending stand beneath lifes pressures  yet a little while and all your woes are past time swiftly fleets and wished eternity approaching brings life undecaying love without allay pure flowing joy and happiness sincere the end
