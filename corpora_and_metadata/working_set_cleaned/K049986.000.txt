speech of richard brinsley sheridan esquire in the house of commons of great britain on thursday january   st      in reply to mr pitts speech on the union with ireland  dublin printed for james moore no    collegegreen       speech etc no common question arrests the serious attention of this house  i have listened mr speaker with more than usual attention to the speech of the rt hon gentleman  and much as i am disposed to admire much as i believe the house may be induced to approve of the very eloquent harangue which has been just now delivered yet i trust that i need not remind it that there are some questions of a nature so serious and delicate which strike home so immediately to our dearest interests that it is peculiarly important that we should be particularly suspicious of the more than ordinary display of mental exertion and jealous of that unworthily directed eloquence that would surprise our approbation to a measure replete with injury and insult to ireland and in my opinion with ruin to the british empire we have long stood in the most trying and difficult situation but that crisis i think has now arrived when it becomes every gentleman seriously to catechize his heart before he is led by the eloquence and abilities of the hon chancellor of the exchequer to do that which he might in his sober judgment reflect upon with pain and perhaps have reason to repent the rest of his life i consider the house at this moment in that situation in which it becomes my duty to apprise them of the danger of listening to the specious arguments by which their minds are attempted to be influenced i took the liberty last week of stating to the house that whether government thought an union was essential to the prosperity of ireland or necessary to the salvation of both countries whether the plan by which the union was to be effected was approved or disapproved yet that in the present crisis of the affairs of that country and under all circumstances as applicable to both the measure was one which was by no means advisable it happened the majority of the house differed from my sentiments yet i may venture to assert that excepting the right hon gentleman and one or two more whose opinions usually coincide with his there is not one gentleman now in the house who does not from his heart regret that such a measure was ever brought forward in ireland the manner in which it has been met in that kingdom is in my mind an additional reason of regret that such a measure should still be obstinately persevered in in this it is to be regretted that the right hon gentleman should when the question was last week before the house have expressed himself in so decided a manner he unfortunately and most unwisely pledged himself that he would make the measure of an union between this country and ireland a favorite object he distinctly stated that it was a measure from which no opposition in this house or in the house of commons in ireland no loss of popularity no consideration of the offense which he might give those friends he valued most should deter him from endeavoring to carry into execution he has this day though not quite in such unqualified terms repeated that pledge  but though he has repeated it the house has not repeated it and i conjure every gentleman in the house that he will not only refuse by his vote this night to sanction such a pledge but that he will give his vote in such way as to preclude the hope of its being brought forward on any future time the right hon gentleman by this proposed measure of an union has placed ireland and england in a very awkward and perilous situation the two countries are in that peculiar situation that it must appear evident to every one the independance of ireland and the power of the right hon gentleman to destroy it are incapable of existing together he has shown that one or the other must be annihilated that they cannot coexist unless indeed the house in its wisdom shall interpose and convince him that it will not suffer him to use his power to the destruction of that country he has by this measure promoted discord and dissension between the two countries at a time when union and cooperation were above all things necessary he has been the means of planting the seeds of discord and dissension between the houses of lords and commons in ireland he has traduced the parliament as an assembly convicted of being the dupes of an english faction there remains but one thing more for him to do which is to raise the british house of commons against the house of commons in ireland this however he has not and i trust he never will be able to effect and i hope sincerely hope that the british nation would rather that that gentleman was plunged in the abyss of public odium national execration and unrelenting hatred than that by any wild desparate daring and impolitic measure he should be permitted to alienate the affection of one country from the other or strike at the political consequence or commercial prosperity of our dear valued faithful brave and generous sister kingdom oh god sir why is it that i interpose between the system of that right hon gentleman and the adoption of it on the part of this house because sir it is a system which is calculated to promote discord and an inveterate alternation of disgust and antipathy when union and affection should be conciliated and confirmed it is because it is a system which must as sure as effect follows cause promote disgust and resentment it is because it is a system which traduces one of the contracting parties as so low so desperate and so degraded as in energy incapable to retrieve the country from the calamities under which it has labored and in mind so weak so pusillanimous so unenlightened such a shame and scandal to the nation over which it presides as to be the continual dupe of every paltry despicable british faction a system in one word which is now endeavoring to array the british house of commons against the representative assembly of our dear and justly valued sister kingdom  i frankly and honestly declare that by far the greatest part of that right hon gentlemans speech was in no shape connected with the question which he was pleased to introduce for near an hour of the time which he occupied the house i was inclined to suppose if such a supposition was allowable either that a stranger had got into the house and the hon gentleman was replying to some speech which he had delivered in some other assembly or that the right hon gentleman in the warmth of his imagination had fancied himself in the irish house of commons and was warmly engaged to what by the bye i did not conceive him adequate on the present occasion a reply to mr foster on a subject which was deeply connected with the vital interests of that much injured but rapidly advancing young country not one part of his argument relates to the question  he is proposing a measure by which the rights of an independent nation are to be destroyed and trampled upon and he thinks he triumphs by endeavoring to show that the arguments of mr foster are unfounded the whole of his argument is that mr foster thought the propositions in      necessary to prevent future jealousy and suspicion between the two countries and the hon gentleman thought if the propositions failed he would be considered a useless minister what is to be collected from this but that both mr foster and the hon gentleman sustained foolish opinions for it turned out that although the propositions did fail the failure was not the means of introducing jealousy and suspicion between the two countries nor of producing the resignation of the honorable gentleman if indeed he can show that the failure of the propositions had produced all those disasters which have since happened all those scenes of distraction and rebellion which the kingdom of ireland has witnessed then i admit the argument would be against mr foster but has he shown that to have been the case on the contrary the argument relative to mr foster stands simply thus mr foster said the failure of the commercial propositions would be the ground of future jealousy and suspicion on the part of ireland well what is the consequence he now says though i did say so i find i was mistaken for it appears to have been the best means of preserving its independance sir there does not strike me the slightest inconsistency in the present sentiments of mr foster on the question with reference to those he formerly entertained and the arguments of the right hon gentleman seem to me to consist in a sort of repartee unworthy his good sense and abilities  but though the right hon gentleman may not have succeeded in fixing the charge of inconsistency on mr foster yet the tendency of his speech has fully developed the system of foul and rank corruption and intimidation by which it seems the measure is or was to be carried does it not throw out an ignominious threat of withdrawing such commercial advantages as ireland may derive from her connection with great britain unless she basely consents to strengthen that connection by the plausible and specious mode which is now so cruelly suggested  the surrender of her independence  and proclaims to an astonished world  her disposition to become a province though from the earliest era of modern europe to this day she has had the strength capability and power to retain the characcter and consequence of a distinct and separate kingdom from great britain are not the expressions which we have heard this night an insinuated threat to those who look upon a legislative independance of ireland necessary to the continuance of her present prosperity for what end could such scandalous and disgraceful threats be resorted to but as the means of intimidation this is fully corroborated by what follows the taunting observations of the right hon gentleman  observations that evince little respect  nay an utter contempt  either for the parliament or the people of ireland  ireland he says ought at this moment to spurn the nature of her present situation and be particularly desirous of embracing the offer of closer union  and why  because such forsooth is her weakness that she is incapable of defending herself and must therefore rely on the protection of her powerful neighbor to defend her what was this but calling on a wretched distressed impoverished irishman to surrender every thing dear and valued and worth defending for the privilege of being defended and when defense would be an object of trifling estimation what is this but to state that our protection is to be withdrawn if she refuses to accede to what is proposed no no exclaimed several gentlemen on the treasury bench i repeat that it is the fair and natural inference  he says that ireland is incapable of defending herself without our connection and that our connection cannot exist without an union  can any other inference be drawn from such a mode of reasoning than that if ireland refuses the union she will be deprived of the protection of this country but is this language sit and proper to be held out if two countries stand in that relation to each other that with respect to the one it has no trade no commerce no manufactures no advantage of its own nothing in fact but what it derives from the other that it is in a situation in which it is incapable of defending itself without the assistance of its powerful neighbor is it not natural to ask how it came into that situation and may i not ask how ireland is in the situation described by the honorable gentleman a country blessed with all the advantages which god and nature ever bestowed a healthy climate commodious ports and a fruitful soil is it let me ask wise in the hon gentleman to press such a discussion and to afford ireland the opportunity of inquiring how it has happened she is not in possession of those advantages which naturally belong to her and by the enquiry to learn that it has been owing to the oppressive unwise injurious policy of great britain for a period of near three hundred years the hon gentleman says he considers the connection between the two countries necessary to each other and that england is little qualified to do without ireland yet he brings forward a discussion which leads to that hostility that may destroy the existence of both with regard to the question of the power of ireland to resist her enemies let me ask the hon gentleman what inducement he could have for offering the insult he has to that country when ireland had her volunteers in arms had she not the means of repelling her foes foreign and domestic what assistance did she not afford this country during the american war cannot ireland say to you before she suffers you to reproach her with her inability to defend herself before she suffers you to reproach her with your  0000 militia in the heart of the kingdom for which you have my thanks could she not say give me back the  00000 irishmen who have lost their lives in fighting your battles above  0000 of her sons have perished in the west indies alone in supporting your contests yet you now say to her you have weakened yourself you are at our mercy and therefore we insist upon your coalescing with us but now the hon gentleman contends that her weakness not only leaves her exposed to hostile invasion but he also seems to feel that the same weakness leaves her at his mercy and therefore he will avail himself of it to compel her to acquiesce in an union while this however most undoubtedly appears to be his real intention he talks of leaving her adoption of the measure to the unbiassed and calm deliberation of her own independent parliament was not this an insulting mockery such at least it must be deemed by men who regard not the words of the right hon gentleman but who look at his actions for their true interpretation and import and when i reflect upon the whole of his past conduct can i believe that this question is to be left solely to the unbiassed judgment to the independent discretion of the irish parliament surely not and therefore i most seriously appeal to the good sense and the high dignity of the house not to lend the sanction of its authority to the shameful means by which this measure is to be forced upon the reluctant feelings of the sister kingdom and what in the name of god are those means do we not see in the foremost rank of them a barefaced and staring corruption that stalks along the land with a purse in one and a scourge in the other do we not see intimidation exerting its discouraging power in the sudden and scandalous dismissals of the oldest and best tried servants of the crown in the removal of a parnell and of a fitzgerald and after this shall we still be told that the adoption of the proposed measure is wholly left to the calm judgment and independent discretion of the people of ireland or rather must it not be allowed that the whole of this imperious and threatening conduct on the part of ministers is a lesson and a warning held out to the irish parliament to enforce their assent or perhaps to hang over them the terrors of a dissolution or show what those who still remain in place may expect from the examples of the punishment that has already been inflicted on some of the fairest and most distinguished characters in ireland unless they sacrifice the dictates of their duty and their conscience to the intemperate imperiousness of an headstrong minister the same stretch of insulting power might perhaps also be resorted to here if any gentleman now in office should venture to consult his conscience and the constitution and espouse the opinion i propose the fate of such a person most undoubtedly would be to be turned out tomorrow for we have been frequently told how important and necessary it is to repress and punish first symptom of insubordination and insurrecttion  but conceiving as i do that the house is not free from the influence ever attained over easy tempers by bold and ingenious sophistry apprehensive that we are in the situation of men who just begin to free themselves by a collected vigorous effort from the chains imposed by beauty or the seductive allurements of an amorous sportive imagination i must adjure the house not to dispose of a question that is perhaps to decide for ever whether a great and generous nation is to retain its independance and by implication to determine whether a set of representatives chosen by a free people must vote themselves out of existence and give up the liberties the property the acknowledged constitutional rights of their constituents to the domination of a power that under the mask of friendship has introduced among them a force originally said to be intended solely for their defense against a daring insidious enemy whom all deprecate but who is not more to be detested than the pretended friend who assists only that he may acquire confidence enough to delude and strength enough to destroy  i must think the house has been hurried along by the right hon gentleman from one degree of transport to another until in the groves of his elysium they have been elated with scenes of grandeur and fatigued with that variety or enfeebled with that richness of prospect which is to render enquiry loathsome and which will inevitably prepare the human mind for the reception of any doctrines however wild  and any assurance of future advantage however illusory i took an opportunity last week of opposing the measure of legislative union with ireland in the first stage of the discussion which as matter of course was to lead to that question i did so then as well from a conviction that measures of such magnitude and of such novelty should always be opposed in the infancy of their progress as in the contemplation of what i naturally anticipated would be the effect of the eloquence of the right hon gentleman i then said what i am at this moment prepared to repeat after much considering the subject that under the present circumstances of ireland in this crisis of her convulsed and necessarily disordered system of polity and general government it is not only impolitic but unsafe to urge nay even to agitate the discussion of topics in the issues of which are to be seen developing themselves the poison and the horrors which are to lay the most hardy and stout of heart prostrate at the feet of a british minister  that are to intimidate and appal the most heroic spirits ireland in her present temper must be beat into this measure and that minister who shall make the bold experiment of flogging a whole nation into stupid beings insensible alike to the duty she may owe herself insensible to the rights of the present generation and the interests of the race yet unborn as much as to the arrogance and cupidity of those who shall inflict the blow or direct the torture  such a minister have secured his minions but it may not be altogether unbecoming him if he be desirous ultimately to prevail to measure his power by the force of his antagonists and in the estimation of his means of victory to seek an antidote against national pride and local attachments  gracious god sir who would have supposed that a british minister wrapped up in the insolence of power and that odious selfsufficiency the genuine characteristic of a narrow and impotent understanding rather than of a manly and vigorous intellect would dare in the face of the irish nation to spurn the assertion of her rights to fawn and flatter her guiltless mind and by seeming to respect her declared unequivocal opinion to full her into inactivity the more successfully to enslave her for ever but let not the right hon gentleman deceive himself whilst he is exerting his ingenuity to deceive ireland let him remember sir that some plots have been so closely wrought some measures of surprise and delusion so intricately planned and attempted to be carried into effect with such novelty of means that the authors the actors even the subordinate characters in the drama have been themselves entangled in the mazes they have contrived for innocence and overwhelmed under the ruins of that fabric which they have erected to overawe the independent  the hon gentleman set out with saying he wished the question to be argued coolly and dispassionately distinctly expressing himself that he wished to submit it to the unbiassed judgment and independent discussion of the parliament of ireland but sir i pay very little attention to the hon gentlemans words i look to his actions and referring to them let me ask is the question left to the unbiassed judgment and independent discussion of ireland is it not on the contrary apparent that in order to carry it corruption is stalking through ireland with a scourge in one hand and a purse in the other is that i ask leaving it to the unbiassed judgment and independent discussion of the country it is the contrary it is not only a mockery but an insult to parliament besides how can parliament tell how soon the hon gentleman may adopt the same line of conduct with regard to the parliament collectively as he has done with respect to individuals if he has dismissed individuals for expressing sentiments different to his own may he not by the same rule dismiss the parliament too if it presumes to oppose him the inference is fair was it just in the case of a viceroy consulting his conscience on a question of all others the most necessary to act according to its dictates was it i say necessary to tell him because he did so he was unfit to be any longer in his majestys service he says that time should be given to the people as well in as out of parliament to consider the subject and for heats and animosities to subside i believe that with respect to the irish parliament his intention is that time should be given to try the effect of further corruption and what sensation will be produced by dismissing the servants of the crown what the influence of the crown is and what are the expectations of those devoted to its services  nor was it the right hon gentleman alone who attempted to justify these measures i have heard them also justified by an hon friend mr canning and never did i hear any thing with more poignant regret for what sensation but that of sorrow and regret could arise in my mind when i heard that hon friend plead the cause of bold and barefaced corruption and thus cloud and contaminate with its oul fog and baneful breath the pure early morning of his political life would he now tell us that the right hon gentleman had given a determined pledge and could not now recede why did he who called upon him to speak was it to encourage his friends in ireland by a display of his resolution  but that was unavailing as the discussion and decision took place there before that encouragement could reach them but as to the charge of urging intimidation neither the right hon gentlemen nor his hon friend who answered me on a former occasion had thought proper to say a word his hon friend mr canning from his parliamentary standing could not indeed have taken any part in the violation of the compact in      and therefore his right hon friend stepped generously forward and claimed all the shame guilt and treachery of it to himself  like another nisus he threw his broad shield over his beloved euryalus to protect him from the vengeful resentment of the irish nation calling out to them  me me i i am the man wreak all your vengeance upon me me me adsum qui feci in me convertite ferrum o rutuli mea fraus omnis nihil iste nec ausus nec potuit    my hon friends abilities might however prove that potuit and as to his courage he was satisfied the house had no reason to call it in question  the generous ardour of the right hon gentleman to protect his hon friend was therefore only the impulse of affection tantum inlicem ninium delexit amicum  then with respect to the rejection of the question by the parliament of ireland the hon gentleman says the measure is necessary to the people of ireland and at the conclusion of his observation he adds that he will wait a more favourabl  nity what does he mean that he will  till the parliament of ireland is convinced by reasoning no he will wait till a day or an hour of additional weakness when the country shall be still further incapacitated for resisting their enemies and more intimidated at the consequence of our withdrawing our assistance what does he mean by saying he will wait does he mean he will wait till a period as one which may or may not arrive when he knows he has it in his power to create it whenever he thinks proper it seems the hon gentleman has now been fifteen years with this system of an union rankling in his heart but has never thought proper to bring it forward till the present moment  what conclusion will the people of ireland draw from such conduct have they not a right to suppose if the measure was never proposed in the hour of their strength and prosperity but is attempted when they are weakened and unable to resist that it is not intended as a measure of advantage to them if when a lord lieutenant was sent over to heal the differences respecting the catholics if when the cup was at their lips it was dashed away and that lord lieutenant withdrawn if the hostilities of the catholics and the protestants were not necessary for him to attend to what must they consider of his conduct when he attempts to introduce an alteration at a time when their weakness prevents them from resisting it does he think that he will by such a measure so carried into effect produce a permanent connection between the two countries does he not consider what will be the feelings of men so provoked  but is this the real argument of one who wields the power of national will when we have already pledged ourselves to support that independent legislation which ireland claimed as its right what reason have we to suppose that if we attempt to destroy that pledge we shall not drive that country to the expedient of gaining assistance and repelling our attacks the hon gentleman treated the pledge of this house and the government at the last adjustment in      as a circumstance of a silly and trifling nature among other terms of scorn and opprobrium he calls it most childish at the time he made this assertion he was not arrived at his full experience he had been but a year and an half in office but i should like to know what the conduct of the hon gentlemans present colleagues had previously been he reviles the duke of portland and the other ministers who were then in power there was a gentleman now a noble lord i cannot remember all the new noble lords names but he was considered the mouthpiece of those who carried that business into execution he brought up the resolutions and it will be sound they passed nemine contradicente surely the hon gentleman will plead his tender years at the time for not remembering this for it was much about the time when he had the application of heavenborn minister bestowed upon him but he says the resolutions were considered as childish because there was one tacked to them which stated that it was necessary to do something further it is quite enough for me to know that there could not be any fraud intended by this last resolution that it could not be considered as a caveat against that admission of the independance of ireland which had been before acknowledged ireland says we will have an independent parliament  right  but to defeat that we will put in the journals what shall have the effect of defeating the claim i am persuaded it is impossible such a hard construction can be put upon that resolution it is libellous to suppose that any one could mean it in that light but i will tell you sir to what the resolution alluded  it was meant that with regard to commerce between the two countries something further should be done but as to the constitution of ireland and its independance that was finally adjusted it was supposed that on the subject of commerce something might arise which it might be necessary afterward to refer to the arbitration of parliament but why was not the hon gentlemans opinion followed up why did he adhere to this silly pledge i believe in the very next year      when this subject was again brought forward by mr flood the hon gentleman did not think of saying there was something more to be done though he must be now supposed to have been convinced that something further was necessary yet he did not intimate that opinion but now at the distance of fifteen years he states there is a necessity for following it up why has he so long delayed because he never before thought he had a favorable opportunity because he never before thought ireland was at his mercy and now as the means of carrying his system into effect he must look forward to those feuds and discords which may weaken ireland and lay her still more at his mercy with his usual lofty tone and carriage he again and again repeats that an union is the only remedy that can heal the evils that afflict ireland or that can secure the salvation of both countries he must therefore persist in it and call on parliament to assist him in the execution of the measure he is willing however to wait for a more favorable opportunity and until the irish parliament is convinced of its necessity and what is that opportunity he pretends to wait for  is it not the day and hour when ireland shall be in a greater degree of weakness does he wait until he can again reproach her with her inability to defend herself and threaten her with withdrawing those commercial favors she receives from england and from which he contends are derived all the sources from which her prosperity arises alas it is but too much in his power to create that moment and here let me conjure let me entreat the house to recollect the shameful manner in which lord fitzwilliam was recalled from ireland at a moment when he was supposed to have been sent over to grant to the roman catholics the rights and privileges which they claimed the cup of concession was just presented to their lips but instead of permitting them to taste of it it was dashed in their faces was this the proof of a sincere desire to reconcile the roman catholic body and if he is acquainted as surely he is with the workings of the human heart must he not be well aware of what men will do when so provoked  we all agree continued mr sheridan respecting the necessity of a connection between the two countries and that nothing could be more fatal to either than that ireland should be possessed by the french should we not then seriously consider how far the enforcing of this measure may tend to favor what the right hon gentleman calls the favorite object of the enemy and which i really believe to be their earnest wish namely the invasion of ireland seeing it as i do in this light have i not every reason and motive for imploring the house not to give it any further countenance indeed in every view i can take of it it appears to me not only to be dangerous but as childish a scheme as that which the right hon gentleman has chosen to stigmatize so frequently with that epithet  in the long and labored calumnies of the right hon gentleman my valued my esteemed friend mr fox has not escaped from the indecent accusation of a proud sullen and domineering arrogance see with what indecency he taunts my honorable friend with not having followed up the resolution of       when he knows full well that that uniform friend to the peace property and independence of ireland remained but two months after in office and therefore could give it no effect  but did the right hon gentleman himself when he came afterward into power attempt to bring forward the objections which he had this night so triumphantly urged had he not now been fifteen years a minister without ever endeavoring to do that which from the first he deemed to be indispensably necessary  he says that in the house of lords in ireland there was a decided majority in favor of the union that in the commons it was nearly equal and that out of doors the largest party were in favor of it  but sir look to the qualities of the division against the union were all the country gentlemen while those in favor of it were persons in office and men of no reputation for independency of political character what is the inducement to the measure held out in cork it is said that its marine will be strengthened and that it will have a dockyard  in the north of ireland it is stated that if the measure is not acceded to they will lose the advantages of their linen trade thus a bribe is held out to one and a threat to the other  the hon gentleman says he must be assured of the continuance of the connection with ireland and then he says that the union is the only way to continue it is this his proposition or not i say it is so but i defy him to mention any one advantage which he offers to ireland for their acceptance of the union which he might not give without that condition for instance the subject of tithes has been mentioned it is said that arrangements are to be made respecting them but permit me to ask him whether if the proposed arrangements are right they cannot as well be carried into effect without the union as with it he has said that every enlightened politician on the continent is convinced what an accession of strength it would be to this country if ireland was united to it by the way i dont like this quoting the opinions of continental politicians but notwithstanding their opinions let me ask whether in pursuing his favorite subject he is not more in danger of acting as the ally of the french than of assisting ireland to repel their attempts if france knows that ireland is so far subdued that she is unable to resist an attack on her independence will not that assurance be the means of her taking those measures by which she may be enabled to strike that dreadful blow she has so long aimed namely the separation of ireland from great britain  the honorable gentleman next comes to the question of the advantages to accrue to ireland by an union with this country he skips over the advantages she has acquired since      and proceeds to give an account of scotland since the union and an argument strongly urged in favor of the union is the prosperity which scotland is said to have enjoyed since it has been united with england  but might not scotland have attained this increase of wealth and prosperity merely by dint of her own industry besides scotland cannot well be compared with ireland  in scotland the gentlemen of property are fond to reside and to encourage trade agriculture etc in ireland it is the very reverse whether without the union scotland would not have been in as good a situation as she is now is more than i can determine but is it not true that ireland prospered from the moment when she shook off her ignominious dependence and insisted on a free and independent legislation it is argument founded on mere guess and hazard to say that after the union ireland will derive an increase of progressive advantages beyond what she has enjoyed since       then he says that the endeavors of our legislature may in the course of sixteen years be deseated by the legislature of ireland he argues not from what has been but from what may be i may say that the two parliaments have now for above  00 years gone on cooperating with each other without exception with regard to what is called the declaratory law he knows that the terms of that law never created any apprehension that it was always considered as a dead letter i assert that there has been a cooperation of  00 years between the two parliaments except only in the instance of the irish propositions it is merely an attempt to entrap and impose upon the house to state that a case may occur in which the operations of legislation may be defeated by the want of cooperation in one of the houses of parliament of the two countries it may as well be said if we send a bill to the house of lords and they do not approve of it  see the mischief of having two houses of parliament whose functions impede each other or if we send a moneybill and they think proper to make some alteration in it we may make the same objection if you reason of what may be and not of what is only see the inconvenience of the argument particularly in a constitution like ours composed of three branches king lords and commons it goes to the destruction of the constitution altogether for the lords may on some question be against the commons the commons against the lords or the king against both and these different estates acting diametrically opposite to each other you would make an argument of their destruction thus it is evident when you argue against experience and fact you argue against the existence of one of the best governments that ever was formed for the protection of the liberty and property of the subject  the hon gentleman next came to the state of france resorting to his old argument of the destruction of order and regular system of government french principles and jacobinism were as usual introduced into the debate and made the subject of splendid invective  but what was jacobinism  was it not jacobinism that pretended to make other states more free independent and prosperous than it found them  was it not jacobinism that called on other countries to resign their freedom their independence and their constitutions with a promise to substitute something better in their place i agree with him in what he states of the conduct of the people of that country indeed it is waste of time to paint the enormities of the french government toward the people of france or their atrocities toward the king of sardinia  those pathetic descriptions which have been so often repeated are of as little effect as the attempts of germanicus who is recorded by tacitus to have endeavored to raise the fury of the soldiers by painting in strong colors the indignities his brothers body had received when it was well known to the army he had no brother i agree that the conduct of france where they have attempted incorporation with other countries is not to be defended but with respect to that system of jacobinism so much deprecated by the right hon gentleman what is it jacobinism is when under the hypocritical pretense of making a nation free you in fact take away all they possess that is worth possessing and in this view the hon gentleman is the archjacobin of all europe he does not know what good he is doing the french cause when he approaches ireland with a coarse french hug of fraternity and reprobates the republic while he is endeavoring exactly to imitate it he speaks of the great favors bestowed on ireland and the acquisitions she has made during the present war i would however have it understood and indeed the hon gentleman has admitted that we did not go to war to gain acquisitions but to prevent the french from making them to prevent france from overrunning the countries of europe and fraternising with the people have we done this have we prevented france overrunning nearly the whole of europe no quite the reverse and as to the acquisitions of ireland we have suffered her to partake in ours o magnanimity o unbounded liberality we say to ireland in all we gain you shall go part  in all our blessings in this war you shall have share what are they the only blessings we have to offer them are non snare of the two hundred and fifty millions expended in the prosecution of the war this is all the blessing is all the recompense we have to offer to poor prostrate ireland  the next argument of the hon gentleman is the ignorance and want of civilisation of the irish i agree with him in the existence of those evils  but from what do they proceed i say it is because men of great property do not as they do in this country associate in a certain degree with the lower classes they do not form themselves into a mass to relieve the poor from poverty and distress they have not the same motive that is the source of the penury and wretchedness of the people of ireland what is the remedy the cause of the evil is the absence of the persons who possess estates in that country and the remedy you propose is an absentee government  with respect to scotland the case is very different to what it is relative to ireland the people of ireland have not that local attachment to their country which the people of scotland possess except a scotchman leaves his native home for the good of his country as the hon secretary over the way mr dundas has done he can be content to remain without roaming all his life but not so with an irishman  in ireland a fashion of emigration prevails and should the measure of an union render it more general among the superior classes the lower will desert their native soil and all its evils and therefore the remedy proposed is calculated to increase and give additional poignancy to the weight of that misery and poverty already experienced  the next argument is held out as a lure to the catholics he attaches all the miseries of the country to its religious feuds and then throws out a lure that when the parliament is away it will be the means of giving freedom to the catholics does he mean that if he thinks catholic emancipation necessary there has been a period since he has been minister in which it could not have with propriety been brought forward in lord fitzwilliams administration will he say that if instead of having been obliged to rescind what that nobleman held out he could not have carried the plan into effect with the general approbation of the country sir if the parliament of ireland find that the disunion weakness and discord by which the country is torn have created the opportunity for wresting its independance if in consequence of this impression it has recourse to union instead of discord concord instead of disunion and sets about healing those feuds which have destroyed its vigor  if the parliament and the people of ireland were to unite perhaps it may still be able to counteract the designs of the hon gentleman should i see that confiding principle spring up in ireland i should still hope to have my wishes on this subject realised  the hon gentleman has adverted to the argument of the competency of parliament to dispose of a question of this kind and to surrender the rights of the people and make over its own independance alluding to what i had said he observed i had avoided giving any decisive opinion i certainly did avoid speaking decisively on the contrary i merely urged the impolicy of advancing any speculation on a subject which he admits to be one fraught with danger and peril i applaud the wisdom and temperance of the irish parliament for not coming to any decisive opinion respecting the competency of the irish parliament he observed that in the case of scotland the parliament of scotland surrendered their rights in the same manner as is proposed with respect to ireland he argues that if the parliament of scotland was not competent to do so you mr speaker have no right to sit where you do and that every public legislative act performed in this house for scotland is the result of usurpation surely a more childish argument was never advanced if there exists a small monarchy no matter what is its size and it is part of the kings coronation oath that he shall not barter the independance of the government as has been done in the german empire by the margrave of anspach to the king of prussia still if he does make the surrender there can be no question of the right by which the power to whom he surrenders his kingdom exercises the acts of sovereignty and legislation wales though not for a considerable time incorporated in the british government yet when it was annexed no doubt was made as to the loyalty of our acts of legislature for that part of the kingdom if others violate the trust reposed in them it does not follow the acts of the government in whose favor the trust is violated are not binding when chester the palatinate of durham and berwickupontweed which were independent of the rest of the kingdom were called on to send members to parliament no doubt was entertained of their legal capacity to legislate those places  but because we have the power of so legislating where a surrender has been duly made yet it does not follow that those are guilty of usurpation who surrender the rights of others by assuming a power of disposal inconsistent with the nature of their trust  it is not my intention sir to oppose going into a committee but i shall certainly object to your leaving the chair for the purpose of moving two resolutions which i shall in case the propositions should be carried wish to have placed before them for the purpose of taking off in some degree that jealousy which the irish parliament i am afraid will be apt to entertain of their passing this house after the measure of union having been so decidedly rejected in the house of commons of ireland  and now mr speaker let me conjure and implore the house not to consider this question as a question of party i know that factions and parties exist amongst us the influence and prerogative of the crown have found their advocates among the peoples representatives but on great questions the house has often distinguished itself by laying aside all paltry petty party considerations  when the good faith the honor the safety of england and the sincere good will of ireland were the subject of consideration  i trust that the integrity of parliament will rise above the murderous and devastating ambition of a british minister  i hope you will sit on this measure as if the character of the land was involved  and that you will not desist until it is completely overthrown  remember the proudspirited character of the irish nation  remember the state of your domestic affairs  remember the eventful crisis of the political world  do not i conjure you take a mean advantage of the distresses of that country or subscribe to a system of evasion of subtilty low cunning and insidious artifice  because it is clothed with a pompous display of words and a ridiculous parade of empty phrases on the extension of the most wild and visionary commercial advantages to ireland which ever deluded the disordered imagination of the most hairbrained politician  do not i entreat you violate your most solemn guarantee and break your faith pledged by stipulation  disdain to be guided by any base false and oppressive conduct to your sister kingdom  degrade not yourselves in the estimation of irishmen by a low underhand crooked policy  you know that the most grovelling ideas can be conveyed in the most inflated language  that it is casy to give a mock consequence to low cavils and to utter quibbles in heroics  abandon the sordid ideas of the mercantile principle on which this obnoxious measure is sounded and show that whatever may be the character of the minister this house has none of the attributes of the trickster and the tyrant exhibit to your dear your valued sister kingdom all the captivating characteristic of expended intellect  study to attain great ends by great means  support truth protect the weak relieve the oppressed and right the injured  but on no consideration countenance fraud rapine ignominy injustice  these are not the times for skulking meanness bombastical prevarication or perverted wisdom  i solemnly declare that in every point of view in which i can consider the measure of an union its great and leading features are  obliquity fraud falsehood solly treachery oppression  the most glaring violation of national faith and the most open breach of solemn engagement  finis
